over a month_ago -PRON- have a bad_experience when -PRON- get stick in the tunnel due_to the manager neglect -PRON- duty of ensure the exit door be open
well -PRON- receive a response from this_company on fb and -PRON- will have to give -PRON- credit -PRON- take -PRON- message seriously
-PRON- decide to give -PRON- a second chance -PRON- document every exist scratch on -PRON- truck and then_proceed to run -PRON- truck through the wash
a detailed inspection reveal that some of those scratch be actually soap residue from a gas_station car wash(very stupid of -PRON- to do to begin with
the staff do care_about -PRON- customer
because of this -PRON- be update this review to 5-star because -PRON- do a good job and take -PRON- feedback seriously

-PRON- go from_scratch to bite to bruise and then the last straw a bruised and swollen head and eye that look_like -PRON- get punch
-PRON- may of hear of -PRON- -PRON- be the parent that finally put -PRON- foot down to this day are mess
-PRON- confront the owner about -PRON- daughter be bully and -PRON- yell_at -PRON- in front of everyone include -PRON- child because -PRON- do_not how careless -PRON- staff be then kick -PRON- out like trash
-PRON- have never be so hurt for -PRON- daughter and offend by someone whose in charge of -PRON- well be while -PRON- be at work

-PRON- would really second guess this daycare

the food be always consistent and very good
the only_thing that be a down fall be -PRON- do_not deliver until 5
but other_than_that food be great and staff be always pleasant
skip be an_old dog -PRON- be so sweet and gentle with -PRON-
-PRON- appreciate the extra time -PRON- take with -PRON-
hey people
this_place
be not nothing like coyote ugly
cause coyote ugly
no_matter how hard they"ve try
will_never be hogs and heifers
cause -PRON- can_not teach cool
for those of -PRON-
that do_not_know
coyote ugly be a direct rip_off of hogs and heifers
-PRON- make a unwatchable movie about a lame rip_off of the original
-PRON- be what -PRON- get with a copy
it;ll
never be the original
this a drinking saloon
no salt no lemon
no lime no wine
and no whining
as -PRON- read these review -PRON- can_not stand the bs
the bartender take -PRON- money as a tip and say -PRON- would put the drinks on -PRON- tab
lie
there be no tabs
no credit cards
cash_only
the bartenders be loud the music be loud
the drinks be strong
there be no vip the only bottle service be -PRON- favorite beer
this bar be america
and when -PRON- get tired of the strip the gambling the lights and the vegas hustle come to the saloon that so_many say
when -PRON- walk thru the door
-PRON- feel
like -PRON- be home
every_time -PRON- take -PRON- car in -PRON- tell -PRON- something be wrong with -PRON- car that be not wrong
then -PRON- proceed to give -PRON- these ridiculous price for -PRON- to be fix
however when -PRON- take -PRON- car to another shop -PRON- be not the same problem that meineke say -PRON- be
and the fix be more reasonable
ex meineke -PRON- need a new transmission and -PRON- will cost $ 2800
other shop -PRON- sensor be unplugged so -PRON- read weird code
-PRON- will plug -PRON- back in and see what -PRON- read
nothing come_back after plug in -PRON- sensor
-PRON- car be fine that will be $_60
be very excited to try this who do_not like cinnamon_roll
-PRON- only try the mini cini and maybe -PRON- be different
-PRON- get two one with cream_cheese icing the other amaretto
-PRON- eat the cream_cheese one asap and find -PRON- to be dry and pretty boring
today -PRON- heat up the amaretto and think that would help
-PRON- do_not
maybe a topping would make -PRON- a little more flavorful
-PRON- will probably give -PRON- another try down the road and hope for the good
-PRON- be struggle with exactly_what to say about this_place because -PRON- see so_many rave_review on how fabulous -PRON- pizza be
-PRON- just bring home an 8 cut with a couple topping and an antipasto salad
the pizza be of decent quality sauce and topping wise but the amount_of topping be scant to say the least and the crust require some healthy chomper to chew
-PRON- mean -PRON- be brutal
to boil this down -PRON- guess for -PRON- -PRON- be a matter of value
this 8 cut could have be fold in half and eat like a taco
very small pizza for a price of over $ 13.00
the salad be fine
fresh and crisp with a nice selection of meat and so forth
again not very big for a price of over $_9.00
-PRON- guess_what -PRON- be say be if -PRON- plan on feed a number_of people -PRON- have good order a lot_of stuff and be prepare to drop some cash
-PRON- guess to bottom_line this
-PRON- would say the food be average at good and the value\/price ratio be poor
will not be go_back only because -PRON- can get good for less and more of -PRON-
by the way as a matter of safety be careful after dark at_this_location
carnegie be not a great area to begin with and this shop be locate_in one of the less attractive part of the borough
huge
friendly service
peaceful atmosphere
-PRON- wish -PRON- could remember the name of the gentleman that take_care_of -PRON-
such a delightful experience
-PRON- think -PRON- recall -PRON- say that this be not -PRON- regular station or something to that affect
-PRON- be white about 6'1 white bushy hair heavy rich voice and an angelic personality
kind_of like a grandpa or something
-PRON- do_not blame the post_office but phoenix would do well to get parking meter in -PRON- city
that permit the use of credit\/debit card
-PRON- coin doohickie be not workin for -PRON-
-PRON- be 2016 not 1986
wildw
excellent experience at the avon location get -PRON- hair_cut by cami
-PRON- be fantastic and very skilled
after get some mediocre cut elsewhere -PRON- be so thrilled -PRON- try there
after -PRON- most_recent visit -PRON- have decide -PRON- be a 5 starrer
actually -PRON- be mostly because of the mango salad
-PRON- be prepare like a traditional papaya salad but in the place of the thinly slice papaya -PRON- get to devour mango
and -PRON- think -PRON- be far_superior to papaya
the thoughtfulness creativity and cravability of this dish be a perfect representation of weera
-PRON- have have numerous notable thai standard like the green_curry but -PRON- really stand out by always have a little twist on the standard that be equally if not more delicious
this walmart be one of those many location that just make -PRON- shake -PRON- head and wonder_why consumer be willing_to put up with this nonsense
and why walmart be such a money make store
-PRON- have shop here about 3 5 time and have always be unimpressed
last_time -PRON- go into the store valentine_'s_day candy be lay on the floor of the main entry aisle a potential safety hazard for at_least 30_minute and be never clean up
ten_minute before the photo studio close the associate clock out and leave -PRON- strand search for an_employee to help -PRON- with -PRON- 30 second transaction
-PRON- recently_purchase a notepad with a magnet on the back to hang on -PRON- fridge that break within a week
-PRON- have be stick in the express line for 10_minute because someone in line ahead of -PRON- do_not have enough money on -PRON- ebt card and be not decisive enough to figure_out_what to put back
-PRON- could go on and on and on
-PRON- recommendation
only shop here in an emergency
and if -PRON- be a female make_sure to shop with a male or a group at night
-PRON- do_not feel safe by -PRON-
-PRON- have drive_by dickey 's bbq so_many time and finally decide to try -PRON- out
the menu be straightforward and easy to pick out a meal
-PRON- end_up do the three meat plate feature chop beef brisket polish sausage and pork rib
-PRON- side be the potato_salad and green_bean
price wise -PRON- be very_reasonable with three meat two side and a dinner roll
-PRON- rank the chop brisket the good of the three meat choose follow_by the pork rib and the polish sausage round out the three base_on flavor and overall texture
the rib be quite tender but could have use more meat surround the bone
chopped brisket be flavorful and somewhat tender
all three meat go well with provide bbq_sauce
the green_bean be very_tasty as_well_as the potato_salad
overall -PRON- would_recommend dickey 's for a quick bbq fix and will go_back again to try other meat combination
-PRON- come_here a few_month_ago and experience amazing service and a great pedi
-PRON- have a wedding this weekend and decide to stop_by for a quick pedicure

-PRON- get in the chair
and -PRON- start the pedi
the nail service be great here be where -PRON- get cray
-PRON- have a flat_screen that -PRON- can watch from -PRON- pedicure chair
last_time -PRON- be there -PRON- play music and then short clip about celebrity nail salons-
-PRON- really_enjoy -PRON-
this time one of the employee be play youtube video on the flat_screen
right in front of me of how to do prosthetic halloween
make up a nail through a finger flesh eat virus etc
as -PRON- can_imagine these image be disturb
-PRON- could feel -PRON- stomach turn
so -PRON- just keep -PRON- head down
but -PRON- could still hear -PRON- all
-PRON- think -PRON- notice towards the end that -PRON- be uncomfortable so -PRON- turn the sound off
but hello
-PRON- be so upset i be tremble by the end
-PRON- be all in plain view
-PRON- get that -PRON- should not expect the most luxurious pedicure but this be a little much
-PRON- tip -PRON- tech
but -PRON- let the youtube gentleman know when -PRON- check_out that -PRON- would not be come_back and that -PRON- be the most uncomfortable pedicure of -PRON- life
-PRON- response

the rice be right and all the ingredient be really fresh and plentiful
the portion look small but -PRON- be really full after that -PRON- even delay eat -PRON- dinner
-PRON- eat a lot
like -PRON- never order salad when -PRON- go out
-PRON- think the price be very_reasonable roll start from $_7.50 and up and this be actually the good quick service sushi joint experience -PRON- have in the downtown core
by quick service -PRON- mean do_not bring -PRON- girlfriend for a special treat do_not do -PRON- bro or a visit aunt from out of town

have be here a_few time due_to work nearby
few consistent issue -order be never ready at the time request -order need to be double_check frequently because have forget add on ' that be purchase
with the first issue -PRON- one concern be that -PRON- have a short work lunch and -PRON- be so convenient to be able_to pick_up food at a specific time
-PRON- be not ready though when -PRON- show_up regardless if -PRON- place -PRON- with 30_min for -PRON- to prep
multiple_time as_well the guacamole have be leave out of the order
no time to head back on -PRON- lunch have call for the refund to be issue a_few time and never be
no use in waste -PRON- time over a_few buck but -PRON- would be nice to know -PRON- would at_least attempt to make -PRON- right next_time
take -PRON- as the warning -PRON- be there be always a reason that place be empty
if -PRON- be out look for halal meal then this be -PRON-
really nice atmosphere
great food
great staff
what be not to like
a_bit far if -PRON- be near the strip but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
room be super disappointing
rest_of the resort be beautiful
write this right_now as -PRON- stare at a concrete wall from -PRON- balcony
few lightbulb not work shower flood furniture be worn
-PRON- stay_here when -PRON- first open and love the hotel
now the room need a little upkeep
also wish -PRON- actually have a view consider -PRON- buy the balcony room specifically for a view
stop in look to buy and be approach by keith
keith be a nice man someone -PRON- would not mind do business with
apparently -PRON- be new though because -PRON- be completely at the mercy of the sale manager
-PRON- want to trade in -PRON- car so keith collect all of the car 's information so -PRON- could appraise -PRON-
-PRON- take -PRON- in to appraise -PRON- while -PRON- test_drive a use mini
-PRON- love -PRON- and could have be talk into -PRON- but when -PRON- get back the sale manager say -PRON- be far too_busy to appraise the vehicle and give no real estimate of time when -PRON- would get around to -PRON-
-PRON- think all of this be peculiar as there really be no other customer to speak of
-PRON- leave and keith call two day_later to offer -PRON- $_1000 for -PRON- bmw
no thank keith
no thank
-PRON- will say -PRON- definitely do_not feel pressured to buy
-PRON- do however feel a little pressured to leave and not come_back
as_soon_as that manager hear -PRON- only want to spend_$ 12k-$15k -PRON- be an instant write off
-PRON- be pretty insulting
the absolute good quality burger in_phoenix hand_down
-PRON- have be go to delux for over_10_year
the quality and taste be always consistent
occasionally -PRON- will get a new waitress or waiter or who be a little inexperienced but -PRON- be try -PRON- hardest
whenever friend or family be in_town and feel_like a burger this be where -PRON- always take -PRON-
tasty food excellent excellent service and all around a great experience
kaka be pack on halloween and everyone have get into the spirit as -PRON- be literally be serve by spirit
there be a large variety_of food and some special treat that definitely be not available elsewhere
-PRON- think -PRON- have 8 of those mango slush shot that night
-PRON- do experience some of the same that other_review mention -PRON- book -PRON- table 3_week in_advance to ensure -PRON- could get a table
the price be also a_little_bit high_than what -PRON- typical all -PRON- can eat go for
all in all though -PRON- would_highly_recommend a visit
-PRON- be a highly_recommend place to have traditional hand make and fresh chinese dumpling bun bao zi and noodle with a variety_of flavor
the manager be nice to welcome and serve all the customer either dine_in or take out
also an important thing be that the price be very fair

-PRON- be all go within_minute
the large macaron -PRON- get be a raspberry macaron with cream and raspberry layer on the inside
-PRON- be by_far the good macaron -PRON- have have
-PRON- also have a lot_of sandwich and pastry that look heavenly that -PRON- would like to go_back and try one of these day
-PRON- call in and -PRON- be able_to see -PRON- an_hour from when -PRON- call

-PRON- be different but good
then -PRON- hubby order a cuban slider and a black and blue slider
-PRON- order the fry_pickle
all 3 be just $_2 each what a deal and really tasty
the cuban slider do have a_bit too_much sauce on -PRON- though
for -PRON- dinner -PRON- have the classic burger with sage fry and the cauliflower steak burger with onion_ring
-PRON- be really exciting for -PRON- as a vegetarian that there be item on the menu that -PRON- can eat other_than the typical lousy black_bean burger
both burger be tasty but -PRON- find the sun dry tomato aioli to be a_bit too greasy for -PRON- liking on the cauliflower burger

dish be somewhere between 10 18 -PRON- think which be expensive for pho but cheap for vegas
if -PRON- check -PRON- review -PRON- love pho
-PRON- be probably spoil by the pho in the south bay
overall -PRON- concern be not about the food so_much as the service
when -PRON- get there the hostess be help a waitress put out some plate

another couple be go in as -PRON- be leave and turn_around and leave because no rib
-PRON- be a bbq restaurant -PRON- should never run out of rib
gimme a break
a good solid breakfast joint and lunch if -PRON- be feel that kind_of way
that be perpetually busy and now -PRON- know_why
-PRON- husband and -PRON- have a rare weekday off together and -PRON- decide to try this_place out finally
-PRON- be a thursday around 10 a.m. and while -PRON- do_not have to wait for a table -PRON- be surprisingly busy
-PRON- be sit_at a small table just off the bar_area and -PRON- server austin be outstanding
-PRON- husband tell -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- first_time there and ask for suggestion and -PRON- immediately whiz off to get -PRON- some complimentary banana muffin

-PRON- husband opt_for a breakfast skillet and -PRON- have the spinach egg_benedict
husband be super happy and -PRON- skillet be huge and have everything -PRON- want
potato more on those later but mmmmmm egg ham tomato onion mushroom and cheese and really -PRON- may be miss a_few item because there be just so_much pack into that thing
-PRON- come with a side of toast and again that butter
-PRON- spinach egg_benedict be
well -PRON- be ok
the egg be poach perfectly and the english_muffin do_not get soggy which be almost impossible with a bennie so mad prop for that
-PRON- do take issue however with a couple of the main part of the -PRON-
the ham be way_too_salty for -PRON- liking and the hollandaise sauce be well just ok
-PRON- be not that -PRON- be bad
just kind_of bland
the potato however be to die for
chop up into bite sized piece and lightly season
no need for ketchup or any dipping_sauce with these spud
-PRON- stand up deliciously by -PRON-
the orange_juice which -PRON- say be fresh squeezed cost a mint
$ 2.95 a glass with no refill
save some dough and forgo the oj in place of something less expensive

the technic use for the pastry and cake be indeed authentic and high in quality than 96 of bakery in mississauga
however -PRON- turnover be not that fast for -PRON- to have fresh_tasting pastry or cake
on the viennoise side croissant etc -PRON- be pretty_much fresh and decent tasting for mississauga
not much option out there
on the cake petit four and macaroon side though -PRON- be a big disappointment
-PRON- all taste_like -PRON- have be previously freeze for month and have absorb all the nasty food smell a freezer hold
the sad part be that all of these cake probably taste amazing as fresh product
-PRON- always support -PRON- but over the last couple month -PRON- have stay_away_from -PRON- macaroon and cake
-PRON- other issue be that that make great quiche but when -PRON- buy -PRON- -PRON- reheat -PRON- in a microwave over
the texture be utterly ruin
-PRON- would_rather -PRON- have less cake variety and selection but that -PRON- taste fresher and that -PRON- invest in a speed oven to reheat item like quiche
this good should work on improve
-PRON- will_definitely get a 5

this be the funny part -PRON- say -PRON- be the only one that can see new_patient
if that be the case then when -PRON- say 45_minute ago that -PRON- be a new_patient should not an alarm have go off for -PRON-
-PRON- come_back the next_day only because of the stellar review and meet dr. grover
very_nice man and seem that -PRON- be very smart
-PRON- need surgery and -PRON- schedule
surgery go well and when -PRON- return for -PRON- follow_up -PRON- need to do physical therapy
-PRON- ask if there be a place close to -PRON- house and -PRON- say yes
that be great -PRON- think since -PRON- office be well across_town for -PRON- and -PRON- be already do pt for a shoulder surgery
however -PRON- say if -PRON- could go to the other pt that -PRON- could go to -PRON- as_well and refer -PRON- to the one -PRON- own
-PRON- think this be rude but try to go
schedule two session at different place so_far from -PRON- house be a nightmare and -PRON- stop -PRON- pt
this review do_not reflect poorly because of pt
the 90 day follow_up be an 8:00am appointment
-PRON- also have an_appointment at 12 p.m. for -PRON- shoulder that day at -PRON- other doctor
-PRON- be into a room before 8:30 too see dr. grover but that be when time begin to stand still
-PRON- sit in there from 8:25ish until about 11:45 yes almost 3 1\/2_hour in the exam room
if the first appointment be at what -PRON- assume to be 7 a.m. how be -PRON- 3 hour and 45_minute behind after only be open for 60 minute
-PRON- come_out of -PRON- room and tell the nurse -PRON- have another appointment but that -PRON- would be wait for almost 4 hour
-PRON- just say ok let -PRON- go and -PRON- have not call -PRON- since
that be over a month and a half ago as -PRON- write this review
-PRON- seem terribly disorganized there be no communication
the doctor do seem amazing but as the owner\/doctor this fall on -PRON- shoulder
-PRON- will_never go_back
second option be where -PRON- will be for any further treatment
probably the good new_york thin crest pizza -PRON- have ever have
ate here three_time while -PRON- be in_town
when -PRON- first open love the pizza and be awesome -PRON- deliver
after a while quality begin to suffer and literally the pizza start to be burn several week in a row
stop eat there for about a year and go_back in November call in an order and be tell 30_min
have -PRON- say longer -PRON- would have not order from -PRON- bc -PRON- have an event to attend
go to pick_up
and -PRON- say -PRON- be not ready 10 more minute
ok
come_back and still not do
this be for 2 pizza
-PRON- be really peeve at this point and almost walk_out
but -PRON- 5yo be beg -PRON- to wait to get -PRON-
another 10_minute
and -PRON- offer -PRON- garlic_knot
-PRON- say how about next_time tell -PRON- an_hour because no one like wait and that be about how long -PRON- take
think -PRON- give -PRON- a pizza for free or something
nope
likely never_go_back
do_not like attitude from business owner who think -PRON- be do -PRON- a favor
-PRON- enjoy go to leroy 's on -PRON- way home from work great place to meet_up with friend the bartender attentive along_with the wait staff
-PRON- specialty be fry_chicken which be quite good but the remainder of the menu be just ok
-PRON- have yet to get excited about the app to really make this_place be a standout be to improve the menu
quality of the food currently the app be equal to chili 's
-PRON- friend stay_here over the week and get a great daily rate for this high_end hotel
-PRON- room be amazing and have a killer view
-PRON- know -PRON- be not too crazy about -PRON- hold 150 $ a day for accidental
that seem a_bit steep
good mexican live_up to the other family restaurant state street other in milwaukee
-PRON- have some of -PRON- favorite chip and salsa
burritos be good
-PRON- order three poutine to go for -PRON- -PRON- daughter and -PRON- friend on a not so busy night only one table have customer on the patio and not too_many inside and -PRON- be after 11:00 pm
-PRON- wait for what seem_like forever for -PRON- order and because -PRON- order extra gravy and -PRON- give a small tip the bill be almost $ 29.34 for 3 poutine
well once -PRON- get home and start eat -PRON- all notice the fry have a strange texture
-PRON- realize -PRON- be because -PRON- be not cook all -PRON- way there be still a raw potatoe texture to -PRON-
so -PRON- call -PRON- up and tell -PRON- the situation and the waitress that take -PRON- order
say to call the manager the next_day
and -PRON- would most_likely replace -PRON- free
well when -PRON- call in the next_day -PRON- be tell there be no manager in -PRON- should call in the next_day
-PRON- say there must be someone there who can either replace -PRON- order or refund -PRON- money and the waitress just say -PRON- be busy no one be there
and -PRON- hang_up_on -PRON-
so -PRON- walk over there because now -PRON- be pissed
when -PRON- get there -PRON- realize the waitress lie because -PRON- see the manager right_away
-PRON- tell -PRON- the situation fully expect that -PRON- would be apologetic for the rude waitress action and to -PRON- surprise -PRON- say -PRON- be the the one who tell -PRON- to hang_up because -PRON- be too_busy to deal with -PRON-
be -PRON- not a customer too
-PRON- say -PRON- be on the phone with -PRON- for 9 minute
-PRON- show -PRON- that -PRON- phone record that -PRON- be a two minute call
-PRON- be so rude -PRON- do get -PRON- money back but instead_of apologize for the mishap -PRON- say that that be the way -PRON- cook fry and if -PRON- do_not like -PRON- -PRON- can take -PRON- business elsewhere
incredible
the bad customer_service -PRON- have see in a while
kaleidoscope have a great selection of juice and -PRON- always find something new -PRON- like
right_now -PRON- love the charcoal water because -PRON- have a splash of lime in -PRON-
and -PRON- help cure any hangover
-PRON- also like the dirt water and the benefit that -PRON- bring
first_time at garcia 's today
come to arizona mills for a haircut and stop for lunch
-PRON- be as really hop inside just after noon on a saturday
-PRON- each order combo plate and no drink and -PRON- still come to $_30
pretty steep for a lunch
no issue with the food at all
-PRON- be typical tex_mex from a chain
the service be nearly nonexistent
after lunch arrive -PRON- come by once more with the check
guess -PRON- want -PRON- to order drink
probably no return in -PRON- future
come_here for lunch with -PRON- family friend about 17 of -PRON-
great value for the price
a variety_of filipino dish and all taste excellent
have the dinuguan kare kare sinagang beef steak tocino beef mechado pork adobo and a_few other
definitely will be go here next_time -PRON- be in_vegas again
what a b-----
the girl at the front_desk be such condescend little arrogant piece_of work
-PRON- have a neuton battery power lawn mower
-PRON- have have -PRON- at_least 10_year
-PRON- start act up so -PRON- call neuton
and -PRON- say that burlap be the authorized repair center for -PRON- and have the battery test
-PRON- say bring the battery and charger only
not the entire machine
-PRON- call burlap to ask for direction and -PRON- speak to -PRON-
-PRON- say to bring the machine in and not just the battery only
after a lot_of bad mouth neutron 's tech center -PRON- gather up -PRON- lawn mower and drive 25 + mile to burlap
the little girl be sit behind the front_desk
-PRON- slowly look up and coldly say what can -PRON- do for -PRON-
red flag start go off
-PRON- know_what be go to happen
-PRON- have see -PRON- type before
-PRON- explain that -PRON- need -PRON- battery test and -PRON- say to put the mower on the sidewalk and -PRON- will write -PRON- up
-PRON- do so
-PRON- come_out and then start ask -PRON- a hole bunch_of question
what be go on with the mower how old be the battery
ok so_far
reasonable question
then -PRON- ask how have -PRON- take_care_of -PRON- battery
do -PRON- charge -PRON- battery every month where do -PRON- store -PRON- mower
-PRON- say -PRON- use the mower every_week
so -PRON- be charge every_week
and -PRON- store the mower in the garage
-PRON- start at -PRON-
that be the problem -PRON- say -PRON- have to store -PRON- in a climate control room
in the house -PRON- response be who the hell store -PRON- lawn mower in the house
what a stupid thing to say
-PRON- then say well that be what -PRON- have to do and now that -PRON- have tell -PRON- that neuton will no_longer warranty the battery
at that time all -PRON- want be to stop talk to this psycho and get -PRON- battery test
-PRON- start write down the information and ask if -PRON- bring everything
-PRON- show -PRON- everything
-PRON- must have leave the blade at home
-PRON- go ape shi-
how be -PRON- suppose to load test -PRON- without a blade
-PRON- swear foam start appear on the side of -PRON- mouth
-PRON- pack everything back in the car and leave
wow
psycho girl do_not go to burlap landscape and supply
p.s. -PRON- go to battery
plus and -PRON- test -PRON- battery and find the one cell be bad
without a blade
the chanter be a sort_of unofficial hang_out for napier student
-PRON- a common meeting point for the beginning of night out for student so as -PRON- can_imagine -PRON- can be quite loud crowd and just generally studenty
-PRON- pretty cheap which be probably why there be so_many student
-PRON- be in the mood for cocktail which be never really a good idea in a cheap bar
the cocktail menu say -PRON- be £ 3 for one or special deal of two for £ 6
uh huh thank for do the math for -PRON- there
but that be not really any sort_of deal
-PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- be just hop people be too drunk to notice or -PRON- just a genuine mistake
anyway as -PRON- can_imagine the cocktail be lousy as be the regular drink
the music be okay quite a varied mix
and there be plenty_of place to sit
that be the old lady in -PRON- come_out again
there be not really anything outstanding about this bar to separate -PRON- from the rest but -PRON- okay for a quick drink to start -PRON- night
-PRON- live out of state and be just visit vegas
need -PRON- chinese_food
so -PRON- give this_place a shot
and -PRON- be amazing
the girl work the cashier be so insanely nice the food be amazing
minus 1_star for the cold egg_roll but the rest be great
plus the food come_out super_fast which be unusual for a chinese_food place
bomb
dot
com
seriously
some of the good pickle veg slice meat pasta sauce everything italian in one happy little place
and free_parking in the back
good
very impressive but not fantastic
-PRON- know -PRON- must be hard to make an entirely vegan menu and -PRON- really be original and yummy
there be a_few thing that -PRON- miss though
-PRON- have the seitan shwarmer which be like a middle_eastern style seitan sandwich
-PRON- be very messy and the bread be so dry -PRON- be hard to eat
the flavor be very good however but a little plain
-PRON- be impressed_by the vegan sauce
the staff be super_friendly
-PRON- would return
pretty amazing brunch
great vibe
megan m take -PRON- order and be helpful and fun
can_not wait to try this_place for dinner
the portion be huge and the service be quick
only_thing be the parking be limit
so bike or walking would be ideal
good stuff
this be go to be a quick review touch screen style
-PRON- have just get_rid_of two import tap for a rotate local stout
the other open tap have go to a waupoos cider prince edward county
and there be the cask too
all in all this_place be one of a favorite local
17 tap of craft brew quite simply be beautiful
other note different pub furniture deco large comfy chair hd espn watch real madrid v lyon friendly_staff do_not have any grub this time but good pub fare
saddle ranch be like a family reunion if -PRON- family involve the entire drinking population of asu
-PRON- swear every_time -PRON- be here
-PRON- get a blast from the past in the form of someone -PRON- barely know year_ago yet still feel the need to acknowledge as if -PRON- be great friend even_though really -PRON- just go rocky point together one year
but -PRON- do_not even remember -PRON- name because there be like 12 of -PRON- and -PRON- be in the other car
and -PRON- be not even 100 sure whose friend -PRON- be
or if anyone even know -PRON- at all
so that be always fun
-PRON- can_not get draft_beer here which be a bummer because -PRON- have big fat tires on draft for $_8 which -PRON- would normally be all about except for -PRON- can_not trust -PRON- to contain 24 ounce of dark beer while wear 4 inch heel and maneuver around crowd of drunk people not to mention a staircase
-PRON- do get busy
but -PRON- have never wait too_long for a drink
-PRON- have like 4 different bar and like 12 bartender on -PRON- busy night so -PRON- actually keep up really well
-PRON- have only ever eat_here when -PRON- be hungover but the chicken tender be good as -PRON- always be at 10:30 in the morning after a bender
and -PRON- have $ 1.99
bloody_mary 's and mimosas on weekend mornings so -PRON- can_not complain there
yes the crowd can be a_bit
douchey
but -PRON- have never really be bother by anyone
honestly -PRON- be a fan_of anywhere in scottsdale that do_not offer bottle service
there be also no cover barely ever a line and the staff do_not act_like -PRON- be do anyone any favor by grace -PRON- with the opportunity to spend money there
-PRON- usually have a pretty_good time here even without the asu drinking congregation reunion
that be like a bonus
a ok
awesome service great food amazing drink
definitely find a new friday_night spot
good service and food but -PRON- tend_to undercook -PRON- steak
the bread be extra but -PRON- be a variety_of artisan style all be very_tasty
also -PRON- be fun to sit in the balcony of this old movie house and reminisce
be that -PRON- have to avoid sugar and carb most of the time -PRON- be not expect jimmy john 's to have anything for -PRON-
-PRON- tag along here with -PRON- friend for lunch to see what -PRON- be about
thankfully -PRON- have an un wich which be -PRON- version_of a lettuce_wrap
-PRON- be actually just as good as eat a sandwich
sure there be no bread but -PRON- be all about the meat cheese veggie and sauce anyhow
the lettuce be crisp and hold together long enough to enjoy eat the full thing and -PRON- be just as satisfy as eat a sandwich
-PRON- figure that bad case scenario -PRON- would have a salad option but surprisingly -PRON- either do_not
or -PRON- just could_not find -PRON- on the menu
in the end the un wich be so_much more satisfying than a salad would have be
-PRON- like mcbroom 's for -PRON- selection but the price be high_than -PRON- be use to pay for beer that can be find at most other distributo
the stuff -PRON- can_not find anywhere_else in pittsburgh make_sense to have a price hike but the few_time -PRON- have try to get cheap\/party beer -PRON- be always 2 4 dollar more per case than anywhere_else
-PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- be own by the same people as d 's six pax
so -PRON- find -PRON- funny that a lot_of other_review claim to find -PRON- sweet that the d 's server send -PRON- here for case
mcbroom 's selection be worth the price but the staff usually give the bare minimum of help and sometimes do_not acknowledge that -PRON- have customer in the store
if -PRON- be in the area or look for something special -PRON- be great but -PRON- would not go out of -PRON- way for this_place on a regular basis
place around the lake should learn from these_guy
absolutely fantastic customer_service the owner and the bartender introduce -PRON- when -PRON- walk_in and thank -PRON- for come to -PRON- bar when -PRON- leave now that be customer_service
drive_by -PRON- -PRON- do_not look_like much from the outside but when -PRON- walk_in the place be so friendly and everybody be so nice what an_awesome place and go have a_few cocktail and just unwind
-PRON- highly_suggest -PRON- pull in the parking_lot stop in and have a drink -PRON- think -PRON- will be pleasantly_surprised
-PRON- be a little smoky so if -PRON- be sensitive to cigarette_smoke -PRON- may not be the place for -PRON- but other_than_that -PRON- be a great place to hang_out
food be great but a huge but when -PRON- order the special of 10 piece for 11 buck plus tax on the window
to cut the thigh piece in half -PRON- be sorry but that be complete fucking bullshit
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- do that shit in latin america to up the number
but that be the most deceptive fucking horseshit -PRON- have ever witness at any restaurant -PRON- entire_life
some of those thigh may have be split into 3rd
no joke
come_out in -PRON- estimate to about 6 or 7 piece
legs be not split
so the deal be 6 or 7 piece for 12 buck out the door
now be -PRON- that great of a deal
not really
how about the food
only_thing that save this_place be the food be great
good solid el pollo loco chicken flavor but actually taste better grill over actual mesquite wood
-PRON- get corn torilla
a bunch
also get a good salsa that have a hint_of carrot flavor that beat el pollo loco and a couple jalapenos that be deep_fry and have a type_of soy_sauce flavor on -PRON- some lemon and pickle onion
honestly -PRON- be a great change of pace from el pollo loco
but and -PRON- mean a huge but
cut piece in half be in a way false advertising and steal from the customer
will -PRON- ever go_back
maybe or maybe not
-PRON- have not decide yet
hysterical
really a great show
lot_of improv with the audience
the whole cast be funny
the magic be great and mr. piffles be great
-PRON- would_recommend this show to anyone visitng vegas
delicious sweet_tea brine roasted chicken corn jalapeño slaw mixed green with white balsamic dressing biscuit with jam and honey and top -PRON- off with tupelo honey beer take home banana pudding
-PRON- go to brassaii twice in one week for two different meal and have two oppose experience
instead_of average -PRON- out -PRON- be go to write two review
this one be for brunch which should get 4_star
-PRON- meet_up with some friend for brunch on a sunday and -PRON- be great to have elbow room as -PRON- be not_too_crowded
-PRON- be disappointed that -PRON- do_not offer any muffin or bread for the table
but -PRON- must_say that the food be great
-PRON- have egg benny with peameal bacon and -PRON- dh have the same with smoked salmon
all four of -PRON- also share a basket of muffin and those be delish
-PRON- do_not feel hurried and linger over coffee and good conversation
this one be for dinner which should get 2.5 star
-PRON- dh bring -PRON- back to brassaii this_past_weekend for a pre birthday_celebration
the place look great and be pretty packed at 9_p.m.
although -PRON- have ask for a corner quieter table -PRON- be seat right in middle next two very loud woman
note that there be barely_any elbow room between table here
to make thing bad -PRON- seat a table of about_10 12 college grad right behind -PRON-
not very fun if -PRON- be try to enjoy a conversation
out waitress be inattentive and ignore -PRON- for most of the evening
-PRON- pour -PRON- own wine and do_not get any bread at all
all this would have be bearable if the food have be good
-PRON- order the foie_gra app and -PRON- be a tiny sliver of -PRON- on a mushy piece_of brioche not very appectiz especially when -PRON- be charge entre price for -PRON-
-PRON- husband order the oyster and there be not anything special about -PRON-
-PRON- have definitely have good elsewhere in to
for -PRON- main -PRON- order the rissotto which be not -PRON- favorite -PRON- have a strange paintain aftertaste to -PRON-
-PRON- husband order the steak and although -PRON- be cook well the portion be pretty sad
-PRON- see the manager owner walk_around but -PRON- ignore -PRON- as_well otherwise -PRON- would have be happy to share -PRON- experience with -PRON-
for the price of the meal -PRON- feel ignore dissatisfied and a little annoyed with all the noise behind -PRON-
toronto have a lot_of other great restaurant downtown
the rating be base_on what the corner alley be rather_than what -PRON- be not
-PRON- be not -PRON- retro ghetto keepin
-PRON- real
-PRON- be actually here to bowl bowling_alley
-PRON- be a trendy upscale downtown bar that happen to have a bowling_alley
the problem with put bowling_alley in downtown area be that -PRON- take up too_much space
which be probably why most of these place have to be more upscale to make the money back
but have be to place like lucky strike and king in other city -PRON- definitely think corner alley do the good with the upscale model while keep -PRON- real enough to actually bowl
the only_downside be that most other people there do_not really know bowl etiquette
-PRON- have go mostly on weeknight when there be usually ample availability of lane
nice that -PRON- do_not have to compete with league here
the drink flow freely while -PRON- bowl and the service -PRON- have have the same server every_time -PRON- think be excellent
the drink be reasonably_price too and the bud light bottle be cute bowl pin shape
bonus
-PRON- have never see anyone in the massive front bar\/restaurant area
but then again -PRON- have only be during the week
-PRON- one major piece_of advice be do_not order the fry_pickle
-PRON- be a sucker for fry_pickle and will order -PRON- every chance -PRON- get
-PRON- be so_excited to see -PRON- on a cleveland menu
-PRON- waitress warn -PRON- however that these be sweet not dill pickle
then when -PRON- go to the restroom -PRON- warn -PRON- date
-PRON- wisely think better_than to override -PRON- order
and all -PRON- can say be -PRON- be right
fry sweet pickle be disgusting
but -PRON- can_not blame corner alley although why do -PRON- make -PRON- this way
because -PRON- be more_than sufficiently warn
let this be -PRON- warning to -PRON- and hopefully -PRON- will not be as stubborn about -PRON- as -PRON- be
basically corner alley be a good central place downtown to go with co_worker or friend where there be something to do other_than just eat or drink
the activity make thing more interesting
and -PRON- be a good balance for a group with bowler and non bowler
-PRON- have be go to vince for the last several year and -PRON- have never leave disappointed
always a great experience
-PRON- have go to barber for the majority_of -PRON- life and vince provide the most consistent cut with the high_standard
-PRON- will be go here here for -PRON- cut for as long as -PRON- be in the area and if -PRON- have leave -PRON- will doubt -PRON- will find another barber on vince 's level

-PRON- always go at lunch because -PRON- love the wonderful variety_of -PRON- buffet
the food be always fresh the option change daily and the food be yummy
the restaurant be small clean and the service be very_attentive
hmmm

-PRON- experience be not bad on the first few_month but the staff always change which be every one give -PRON- a different respond
the quality of the electrostatic not good
also one day someone try to enter -PRON- neighbor apartment

this be a must eat in_vegas
d licious
adobo fry_rice omelet be uh mazing
crave a little culture in -PRON- life
well cancel -PRON- flight to nyc for the smithsonian because believe -PRON- or not -PRON- have some cultural option right here in the desert 's playground
-PRON- go to the heard museum many a day when -PRON- be a little girl visit phoenix a much_less populated city at the time
from the craft to the history the heard museum entertain even an 8 year_old who really just want to play in the pool all day long
fast_forward a couple of year
and -PRON- decide -PRON- be time to give this historical haven the grownup test
-PRON- friend -PRON- be more_than impressed
-PRON- know_how sometimes -PRON- visit someplace as a kid
and then -PRON- go_back as an_adult
and everything seem small and just cheaper look
do_not worry_about this be the case with the heard museum
-PRON- have do a fabulous job of keep the museum up to date clean and full of great way for all age to learn about the native american culture in arizona
some highlight include 1
interactive
the heard create great display with information and an interactive game for child or child at heart
2

-PRON- do_not cheat -PRON- on historical artifact exhibit which show that -PRON- have a nice group_of donor who be eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating
3
family fun for everyone
-PRON- see a brochure marketing family fun day every saturday in july
activity include interactive game craft live performance etc 4
az resident friendly
the admission price be $_12 and -PRON- cringe a little but then as if -PRON- be mean to get a little cultured that day -PRON- tell -PRON- that az resident receive free admission every second sunday of the month
not a bad way to take_care_of the resident melt_in the heat 5
cafe food
-PRON- actually want to eat
to make the most of the day -PRON- eat at the cafe and take_advantage_of the 85 degree weather while -PRON- still last
the food be good
-PRON- have a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad
just write that down make -PRON- hungry and want to go_back for more
so now that -PRON- have spread the good word on the heard -PRON- be time to check -PRON- out for -PRON-
-PRON- have only ever be to the walk_in clinic usually when -PRON- realize that otc drug and ginger ale be not go to make -PRON- throat infection go away
and -PRON- decide to bite the bullet and get some antibiotic
this_place be always busy even if -PRON- go first thing in the morning before -PRON- officially open
-PRON- have never be the first one in line despite set an_extra early alarm and boot -PRON- to the clinic as fast as -PRON- sickly body can move

yesterday the parking_lot be full and closed for a full 40_minute before show time
after a twenty_minute snail crawl drive to the overflow lot people be literally run in order to make show time
if -PRON- be a female -PRON- can all but forget use the restroom

stop the hard sell and do what people pay -PRON- for
this_company should be out of business
oh wait what be that

not really sure_why this_place have such high review
-PRON- friend and -PRON- order the hot_pot which be basically meat and vegetable in a sugar soup
so gross
-PRON- also have a side of potato pancake which taste_like really oily hash_brown
that taste good
but -PRON- be really hard to mess_up fry potato
at_least -PRON- manage to withhold put sugar in this dish
800 review
woohoo
cough* ok
so -PRON- go to dreamscapes after search and scour the internet look for an artist who do vivid color work
-PRON- finally find margaret
margaret be good to work with very relaxed but serious about -PRON- work
-PRON- e_mail -PRON- drawing of -PRON- design and -PRON- be set to go
-PRON- go to -PRON- to get a tattoo that represent -PRON- wedding a long stem sunflower with the date work into the stem and have give -PRON- a_few picture for guidance
and -PRON- do a great_job take -PRON- idea and turn -PRON- into a good design
so t day arrive and -PRON- get to the studio only to find that -PRON- be sick and be not in boo
that would be -PRON- one complaint because -PRON- know -PRON- have -PRON- e_mail and could have send -PRON- a message
so -PRON- would not have drive across_town for no reason but -PRON- happen
reschedule over the phone
go in a couple week_later and -PRON- be there hooray
-PRON- do the job quickly but precisely
now that -PRON- be mostly heal -PRON- be very happy with -PRON- work
-PRON- do a very good job and the cost of the tattoo be reasonable
-PRON- would have no hesitation recommend -PRON- and return to -PRON- in the future
head up this be a casino and club free review
with that say -PRON- feel that at any minute -PRON- be go to see don johnson walk_around the corner in the miami drench theme
-PRON- have to admit the stark white lobby accent with color lighting be a_bit jar at first and then overall kitschy but what in_vegas be not
-PRON- try to check in early but that be a no go and -PRON- be a_bit bummed about have to kill a_few hour when all -PRON- want to do be nap
-PRON- be a long day of travel
the people at the front_desk be polite and the room be standard
nothing be break or leave dirty and everything work fine
-PRON- do however request a city view room which -PRON- get
apparently the mgm grand across the street and the hooters hotel behind the tropicana right
-PRON- do_not_know hooters had a hotel count as the city
so -PRON- go to bed every night with a giant image of david copperfield star at -PRON- as -PRON- fall_asleep
-PRON- check_out the pool area and -PRON- be pretty small and -PRON- get an overall vibe of douche yness
so -PRON- avoid that all together
overall a decent place to stay for a_few night
and -PRON- be on the strip
monica and -PRON-
biziq
team have be do a phenominal job for -PRON- at mystic islands casino
-PRON- mobile friendly website be great and -PRON- be always quick to respond to -PRON- many question
-PRON- could_not ask for good service
thank -PRON- monica
-PRON- be an acquire taste for chinese_food if -PRON- be not chinese this be not for -PRON-
-PRON- have to wait for a while to be serve
go today to celebrate -PRON- -PRON- daughter 's 16th birthday
-PRON- be -PRON- choice as -PRON- come_here a year_ago for one of -PRON- friend 's_birthday
party of 5
all -PRON- can eat
-PRON- take over 10_minute after -PRON- get -PRON- table to get the tablet
-PRON- place -PRON- order on a tablet rhey give -PRON- and when do hit a bottom to send -PRON- in
the server come check -PRON- up and go
good start
food start come ay a steady pace at first but shortly_after start come notoriously more space out
some of the item where great and other like the brocoli salad taste awful and stale
server work almost in a robotic manner
perhaps because the place be busy
-PRON- be surprised that be the case for a monday evening
cleanliness this be one area where -PRON- lack good service
the lady washroom be filthy and one of the 3 toilet be overflow leave only 2 available
service several random waiter attend the same table
so some where kind some where more stoic
food
-PRON- would give -PRON- a 3_star for then freshness and quality and a 4_star for variety as there be a lot_of choice on the menu
price alcoholic beverage be price right
all -PRON- can eat dinnet $_25 p\/p
comparable with other sushi place in oakville
if -PRON- pay cash -PRON- get 10 off the bill
facilities
decor be modern spacious and with booth type table
locate_in a nice entertainment plaza
overall a nice place to come in a group
a_bit too rush and hectic feeling if -PRON- be look for an intimate romantic dinner or quiet place to eat
the folk at cane 's have chicken down to a science
the quality be the same every_time
do -PRON- pay for -PRON-
sure
but the alternative be to go_somewhere_else and get a possibly dicey product
the virtue of cane 's be that -PRON- never wonder
and that be amazing
even more amazing that -PRON- a $_6 lunch
the fry be crispy and the buns\/bread be buttery and toasty
the sauce be delectable
the drink be small and pricy
the restaurant be cold probably to keep the hot poultry grease odor at bay
this_location have a small outdoor_patio
very_popular this time of year
who can blame people
-PRON- watch a kid clean the table
-PRON- take -PRON- job seriously
-PRON- guess with the messiness of the food -PRON- would have to
-PRON- like -PRON- when -PRON- go up to ask for a box the girl acknowledge -PRON- right_away even_though -PRON- be busy
what a great place in gastonia
so so_many beer to_choose_from
so just start order and drinking
the wait staff be great with -PRON- suggestion
food be very good
will_definitely_return
see zarkana since -PRON- be stay_at the aria
-PRON- have see many cirque_show over the year
-PRON- be concerned because of some review -PRON- read on_yelp
overall -PRON- be very happy with the show and theater and -PRON- do_not match the negative_review -PRON- read
great theater many good act that be perform very well good live_music and a fun experience for -PRON- group_of 4
-PRON- think since there be so_many good cirque_show out there -PRON- start to get hard to impress
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend -PRON-
sit back and enjoy the show no need to try to pick -PRON- apart
-PRON- have never like mercedes benz before
-PRON- always find -PRON- so old and stuffy and very conservative
well -PRON- be obvious since -PRON- target audience be old man and woman_who prefer a smooth drive and luxury to a fast sport car
-PRON- guess beacuse of the clientele the sale people be more upscale a little old and much wise
this weed out those young pretentious douche that think -PRON- be all that because -PRON- be sell nice car
all the salesperson be great here
mind -PRON- -PRON- be markham so the majority_of -PRON- be chinese but there be a_few that be of non asian decent
the only problem be that when financing or deal with any type_of accounting info -PRON- must go to the in house accountant and there be only one of -PRON-
that mean if -PRON- have already get a customer -PRON- ass have get to wait
but everyone be friendly ask if -PRON- have be help or need anything and what not
plus the wait area be full of good stuff
there be a beverage dispenser that have all different_type_of coffee tea or hot_chocolate or a combination include just plain hot water
coolest thing
even the service department do_not_disappoint
although -PRON- may be a_bit bias as -PRON- do know one of the service guy so -PRON- make_sure that the car be spic and span and -PRON- have a good rental to drive while -PRON- be in the shop
but these be convenience that should be there regardless of who -PRON- know
-PRON- may not like the car mercedes but the salespeople and service people at the dealership may just change -PRON- mind
the pizza be pretty_good but this review be about the server -PRON- have johntel
-PRON- be not joke when -PRON- say johntel be easily one of the if not the good server -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- entire_life
-PRON- be such a genuine soul who really_care_about -PRON- experience and brixx
-PRON- be attentive and helpful and make_sure -PRON- have everything -PRON- need
-PRON- be so impressed_with -PRON-
-PRON- can_not say enough good thing_about -PRON- experience at brixx
-PRON- be late and -PRON- find -PRON- at the luxor and look for a late dinner
the pyramid café be open_24_hour and look appeal with -PRON- half circle banquette and view of the bustling casino
-PRON- order a favorite -PRON- have not have in year a monte cristo $ 11.95 sandwich
-PRON- be serve with ample amount_of ham turkey and cheese and cook to the proper golden brown along_with a very_nice strawberry preserve
the sandwich be good but the french_toast could have be good
-PRON- wife have the california turkey panini top with cheese avocado and tomato $ 11.95 serve on a ciabatta roll
tasty enough but not press or grill in any manner
huh what be up with that
-PRON- see another patron get serve the same_thing and watch the quizzical look on -PRON- face as -PRON- lift the top of the uncooked roll
be the press in the kitchen on the fritz or the executive chef do_not_know that most people expect a grill panini when that word -PRON- be not in italy be use
now that -PRON- think about -PRON- how can -PRON- press a sandwich with tomato and avocado on -PRON-
maybe -PRON- should rename -PRON- the warm pyramid café turkey sandwich
next_time -PRON- will go with the all day breakfast
-PRON- have be go to zipps for many_year and overall -PRON- be very good
sure -PRON- can be hit or miss on some item but -PRON- consistently have very good wing especially the honey golden
tip
if -PRON- like -PRON- wing a little crispier then make_sure to ask the server that -PRON- be order that way as ometime -PRON- can be a_bit undercooked but -PRON- be still always very good
-PRON- also like -PRON- chicken focaccia sandwich
the onion_ring be also wonderful most the time but sometimes be a_little_bit limp and need to be send back to be crisp up a_bit
but overall -PRON- be very happy with -PRON- experience at zipp and -PRON- will_likely continue to visit roughly once a week for the rest_of -PRON- life
-PRON- go with a party of 4 include -PRON- wife brazilian to this_place because of good experience elsewhere other fogo 's and rave_review on here
food wise -PRON- be great -PRON- would give -PRON- 4_star however -PRON- waitress
-PRON- will give 2_star and here be why
unfortunately -PRON- be deal a very pushy and present waitress
for_example -PRON- ask for the mango caipirinha and -PRON- basically talk -PRON- out of -PRON- say -PRON- be not very_popular -PRON- should instead have the one with amaretto but -PRON- wife say -PRON- do_not like amaretto
so -PRON- ask for the original
next the waitress come_back with the one with amaretto say -PRON- bring this one anyway since -PRON- know -PRON- will like -PRON- -PRON- can_not taste the amaretto and if -PRON- do_not like -PRON- -PRON- will bring -PRON- the other one
well needless_to_say -PRON- wife do_not like -PRON-
so -PRON- have to get -PRON- to bring the other one
there be many more example like ask if a particular person want more wine while at the same time start to pour -PRON-
take plate and dessert order while one person be still finish the meat
and at some point -PRON- be even diss a meat server right behind -PRON- after -PRON- put the meat directly on the plate
the experience just become such that -PRON- try to avoid at any cost to have the waitress come to -PRON- table for any thing
unfortunately the waitress -PRON- have overshadow the quality -PRON- think this_place have
obwohl da lokal fast leer war lange wartezeit aufs essen
erstbestellte wurde nach ca
30 minuten abgesagt da es nichtmehr vorrätig war
bedienung langsam und lustlo fleischqualität unter durchschnitt spätzle aus der tüte souce ohne würze und pepp
eher al unterdurchschnittlich zu bewerten
two year_ago -PRON- would have give a five_star
the last several month the service have go downhill
call to place to go order be on hold 11 minute a total of 15_minute to order
food deliver two entry an_hour and eleven minute_later
-PRON- write this review as -PRON- try to call to find out where -PRON- order be
the phone rang and ring and ring finally disconnect assume by phone company after 3 minute of ring
sad when good food be overshadow by mediocre service
since -PRON- be introduce to this mall -PRON- have easily become among -PRON- favorite
everything be well care for the fire pit be so cool in the winter there be so_many place to kick back relax and enjoy the atmosphere
-PRON- be here atleast 2_3 time a month between go to harkins and massage_envy
there be a balance of store here however only a_few place to eat
-PRON- be vegetarian and be skeptical of go to a korean bbq restaurant but there be a lot_of good vegetarian_option
the service be also excellent
another place turn the cheap wing into something expensive
other_than_that the food and well drink be ok and price as -PRON- would find at most local bar
-PRON- be disappointed when -PRON- tell -PRON- one of -PRON- flavor -PRON- be out of but with that many flavor -PRON- not hard to find a replacement
5 level of heat count as 5 different sauce so -PRON- really only have about 20 flavor
excellent service
drinks be serve promptly and the food be delicious
-PRON- expect this to be the next hot spot in_phoenix
go there before the crowd figure this gem out
-PRON- have be come to ghandi 's for almost fifteen year
-PRON- be one of -PRON- favourite restaurant if not -PRON- favourite
two or three year_ago the chef change and the food suffer a little
but -PRON- have a chicken roti tonight and -PRON- be back to the perfect combination of sweet\/tangy\/saucy\/thick that make -PRON- rotis so good
here the perfect meal for -PRON- be a chicken roti a side of mango chutney wash down with a mango carrot juice
-PRON- ultimate comfort_food
thank -PRON- ghandi cuisine
now accept interac

-PRON- almost feel_like -PRON- be in san_francisco
-PRON- order the seaweed_salad
-PRON- be a very_generous portion but -PRON- only_gripe be -PRON- be completely cover in sesame_seed which i be not a fan but know next_time to request -PRON- to be leave out
the seaweed -PRON- be very fresh and the right_amount_of dressing be use
then i order the hawaiian roll with soy paper
-PRON- have albacore shrimp and cucumber inside wrap in a cajun albacore and avocado toss with some ponzu sauce heaven
seriously one of the good sushi_roll -PRON- have ever have

love cracker barrel
and i always have
but this be unacceptable
-PRON- am truly disgusted with this cracker barrel
-PRON- enjoy all the variety_of selection of rv 's to see
but -PRON- unfortunately get salesman toby who -PRON- do_not like at all
-PRON- have have a lot_of experience with salesman on -PRON- life and -PRON- be the bad
no personality
very to the point of be arrogant cocky and pretty_sure of -PRON- not in a good way
-PRON- would go_back but never want to deal with -PRON- again
so happy to have pizza rock closer to home
same amazing pizza 's
-PRON- have try so_many and never have a bad one
-PRON- favorite be the sausage and stout pizza the butcher and the new yorker
can_not go_wrong_with the sam giacana or michigan ave
either
the spicy calamari be delicious though -PRON- wish -PRON- would go_back to the small piece bc sometimes the large calamari do_not get crispy enough
amazing happy_hour special too
-PRON- be be three month and -PRON- have have disgusting nasty sewage issue
if -PRON- can_not do basic maintenance -PRON- can_not imagine the health department have visit in a while
steph judgement
cool screen space
came here for a daytime screening of the new_york hardcore documentary as part of punk rock bowling and -PRON- be great
-PRON- be large for a private screening space but on the small side for a regular movie_theater
the sound be not the great but because -PRON- be vegas -PRON- get to bring in drink yay
-PRON- have a fine time with other enthusiastic attendee and -PRON- hope to see other film here in the future
the truffle_fry be pretty_darn delicious would come again just for those
burger be great as_well
service be excellent megan be friendly efficient and check in with -PRON- just the right_amount
also -PRON- may seem_like a small thing but this_place have really wonderful ketchup
the atmosphere be fun without be so loud that -PRON- could_not chat
-PRON- would enjoy come in with a large_group but -PRON- could_not really see any table that could be set_up to accommodate that
this be -PRON- number 1 favorite restaurant
food come_out super_fast and the quality be consistent
-PRON- have never have a bad_experience at kebab je
every_time be great
the food be just so flavorful and the owner clearly take_pride_in serve quality food which be so admirable
-PRON- just wish -PRON- serve alcohol so -PRON- could enjoy all -PRON- delicious lebanese food with a nice glass of wine
-PRON- love red robin particularly at_this_location since -PRON- open
now not so_much
the food have always be great no_complaint there
service though be definitely on the downside
while wait for -PRON- hubby to join -PRON- -PRON- order a drink that be immediately bring to -PRON-
so_far so good
when -PRON- do_not arrive momentarily -PRON- decide to order an_appetizer via the new tabletop monitor
-PRON- waitress pass_by -PRON- and the blink monitor more_than once
never do get a chance to order one
when -PRON- see -PRON- husband enter the restaurant -PRON- order a drink for -PRON-
-PRON- then wait 20_minute for -PRON- waitress to finally take -PRON- order
then -PRON- wait and wait and wait for -PRON- food
finally -PRON- arrive
-PRON- be never ask if -PRON- need anything or if -PRON- want more food
-PRON- ask for a glass of water
twice
never get -PRON-
after be there for 1 1\/2_hour -PRON- ask for the check
-PRON- leave -PRON- comment_on the monitor when -PRON- pay the bill but never hear back from red robin so -PRON- decide to leave -PRON- comment_on yelp
hopefully thing improve
if not then -PRON- be back to eat at the mills
club review -PRON- friend and -PRON- get in without have to pay the $_20 + cover because -PRON- be in_town for nab and -PRON- pass get -PRON- in for free
that be the one of the few good thing of -PRON- experience here
the dj and the music be also pretty_good
no_complaint there
-PRON- be not even complain_about the $_8 -PRON- spend on a newcastle
-PRON- be however complain_about the staff with attitude that work here
-PRON- be also raise an eyebrow at the staff about -PRON- miss item
here be what go down sunday 4\/15 on the dancefloor a random patron tap -PRON- friend on the shoulder to ask -PRON- if -PRON- lose a cell_phone
-PRON- friend look_at the phone say -PRON- be not -PRON- then witness the patron turn the phone in to the dj
several moment later -PRON- other friend realize that -PRON- cell_phone be miss only to find out that this be the same phone that be find earlier
both friend go to club security with the info that the phone be give to the dj only to find out that club security take -PRON- to hotel security
hotel security have no record of -PRON-
tuesday 4\/17
while in line to get in one of -PRON- friend step away to find hotel security to hopefully get more info on -PRON- miss cell_phone
when -PRON- return the club bouncer immediately extract -PRON- from the line
-PRON- understand that -PRON- be only do -PRON- job and not let people cut
but rather_than tell -PRON- to get to the back of the line -PRON- flat out tell -PRON- to leave
-PRON- be not go to let -PRON- into the club
-PRON- mean -PRON- friend be not even intentionally cheat -PRON- way in
-PRON- be sure that the 2 people in line behind -PRON- do_not_mind that -PRON- save -PRON- friend 's spot in line but even if -PRON- do -PRON- would not try to disrespect -PRON-
the bouncer just want to throw -PRON- power trip around on a tuesday_night
after some major ass kissing on -PRON- friend 's part the bouncer finally let -PRON- go to the back of the line
on the dancefloor another friend realize that -PRON- clutch purse be no_longer on -PRON- wrist
in a panic -PRON- whole group be search the entire club for the purse
club security notify -PRON- that -PRON- be find but when -PRON- hand -PRON- over -PRON- iphone be miss
one of the guy in -PRON- group continue to question club security about the miss iphone who claim that -PRON- have not find one
but in desperation -PRON- friend say to security -PRON- will pay -PRON- $_20 for the iphone and security 's response be wait
what color do -PRON- say -PRON- be
wtf
why do security suddenly change -PRON- story the moment -PRON- friend offer a bribe
-PRON- do however have to say that the random patron that -PRON- meet at this_place have be extremely cool and genuinely concerned with all the bad stuff that keep happen to -PRON- throughout the night
-PRON- even get invite to hang_out in the vip area for table service by a_few different group
again -PRON- understand that staff be do -PRON- good to make_sure that the table stay reserved for those_who reserve -PRON-
so when one of the waitress tell -PRON- that -PRON- have to leave -PRON- try to politely explain to -PRON- that the people_who reserve the table invite -PRON- to drink with -PRON-
-PRON- respond with the big attitude do_not yell_at -PRON-
um hello
-PRON- be not yell_at -PRON-
-PRON- be just talk loud because -PRON- be in a club and if -PRON- do_not talk loud then -PRON- will not be able_to hear -PRON-
the staff here need to get over -PRON-
smh
-PRON- go here for the first_time the other day with -PRON- boyfriend
a nice perk be that -PRON- open pretty late since -PRON- decide -PRON- want a last_minute late_night dessert after dinner on a weekday
-PRON- go with -PRON- strawberry cheesecake but could_not decide if -PRON- want the bacio or nocciola
luckily -PRON- offer sample tasting of any flavor so -PRON- get to try both
-PRON- still take -PRON- a while to decide because -PRON- be both so good
but -PRON- go with the nocciola hazelnut rather_than the bacio which taste_like ferrero rocher after the friendly girl behind the counter tell -PRON- -PRON- would pair better with the strawberry cheesecake
boy be -PRON- right
the sweet fruitiness of the s.c be mellow out by the hazelnut
good call
atmosphere be very clean nicely light and not_too_crowded on a tuesday_night but -PRON- be obviously busy with business
place be clean and nice
-PRON- sit out on the patio and share -PRON- gelato there
-PRON- both enjoy -PRON- a lot and be plan to return again asap
-PRON- be usually just medium on bbq but -PRON- think rollin smoke be awesome
-PRON- split the 5-meat sampler and the meatloaf and everything be really good
but -PRON- mostly looooovv the meatloaf
and the fry corn fritter thing
man those be so good
this be a ton_of food
2 adult and 2 kid eat that night and have leftover for all of -PRON- for another night
-PRON- can_not say much else that other_reviewer have not mention
-PRON- be worth a trip whether local or tourist
a great place for local
all drink be $_5.00 include premium liquor and for $ 10.00 -PRON- can get johnny walker blue label
that be cheap_than -PRON- can get at home
the hostile grape have free wine tasting every friday and a band play later in the evening
great deal
-PRON- also have an_awesome brunch sushi bar and steak_house
omfg one of the good steak and egg -PRON- have so_far
the good part about -PRON- steak and egg be that -PRON- be 24_hour
-PRON- do_not have to wait until midnight
-PRON- go to kopy 's late saturday_afternoon while visit friend in pittsburgh
the guy use to frequent kopy 's when -PRON- live in southside so -PRON- want to stop in for little nostalgic rendezvous
-PRON- be tell this be the only place -PRON- can get a guinness for under_$ 5
-PRON- must have be right because -PRON- guinness and -PRON- sierra nevada total $_7.50 not bad
kopy 's have a pool_table dart board juke box and some other weird game
-PRON- have a_few high top table and about 12 bar stool
-PRON- be pretty dead when -PRON- be there but -PRON- imagine -PRON- may draw more of a crowd at night
the only major downside for -PRON- about kopy 's be the cigarette_smoke
-PRON- be all for hang at dive_bar when -PRON- be with the right crowd but -PRON- hate be in establishment that allow smoking
so gross
-PRON- eat there yesterday to celebrate -PRON- good friend 's_birthday because this be -PRON- favorite restaurant
the antipasto salad be awesome
-PRON- order baked rigatony which be mouth watering the only_downside be the pasta be undercook so -PRON- ask the server to exchange -PRON- with a new one
the service be ok -PRON- refill -PRON- water one so -PRON- friend be ask for -PRON- water
-PRON- think -PRON- be a busy night for -PRON- server that -PRON- forget to refill -PRON- drink
-PRON- love this store
from purse to jewelry shoe to houseware there be something for everyone
-PRON- always seem to find something in the cosmetic section
the other day be be alba towelette and leave in conditioner
and then -PRON- move on the kitchenware and snag a deal on a calphalon pan
-PRON- can always find something sparkly at the jewelry counter at_this_location
the only_reason why -PRON- do_not give this_location 5_star be because the child_'s clothing section be seriously lacking
work with ron here
quite knowledgeable_about different mattress and more_importantly -PRON- listen to -PRON- sleep style and offer accordingly rather_than just let -PRON- lay on everything
go in not buy anything leave with a wallet $ 3000 light
can_not wait to get -PRON- new tempurpedic tomorrow and get back to sleep good after another mattress store stick -PRON- into a mattress that be far too soft
this be the second -PRON- have order take out from this_place and this will_definitely be the last
for starter when -PRON- call to make the order the person on the phone be not familiar_with the menu and do_not even supply -PRON- with a total after ask for one
-PRON- still give -PRON- the benefit of doubt and go to pick_up the food
once -PRON- get there
-PRON- realize that the actual take out area be out of order and that -PRON- have to go around to the other side of the restaurant
-PRON- do_not let that bother -PRON- since -PRON- think the food would be worth -PRON-
-PRON- be wrong
the food be horrible for the most_part
there be absolutely no flavor so -PRON- have to season -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- order be miss the salad that -PRON- advertise and one of the condiment container have mold growing yuck
-PRON- will not be return and -PRON- would advise other to stay_away also
tldr solid wing deal on_tuesday but long_wait
wing be not bad service be ok
would come_back from time to time
if -PRON- be from the scarborough area then -PRON- would know that on_tuesday 's this_location be mad packed for the half price wing deal
the wait for a table be usually hella long and the wait for -PRON- food be about the same
-PRON- only come to st. louis for -PRON- wing deal
so -PRON- be not too sure about the wait during the other day
to get wing for half price -PRON- require -PRON- to buy a beverage beer pop etc
-PRON- usually get 1_lb of garlic parmesan and 1_lb of something new
the gar par be usually pretty solid and the meat be relatively juicy
though for the dry rub option -PRON- not always consistent
-PRON- last_visit i try the lemon pepper and the seasoning be not bad but i think the meat be tough to eat
the size of each wing be pretty standard as_well
service here be not bad though -PRON- friend and i usually give -PRON- some slack as -PRON- be a full house every tuesday
be the deal worth wait 20 30min for a table and another 30 40min for food
-PRON- honestly do_not_know
some day i think -PRON- be worth some day i do_not
-PRON- think -PRON- be really up to -PRON-
if -PRON- be really crave wing
there be good place to eat wing but the deal be the reason_why i keep come_back
oh and also the thick cut fry and the killer garlic dill sauce
that sauce be definitely import from mount olympus or something because -PRON- be pretty godly
hi at j nail be fantastic -PRON- be able_to accommodate -PRON- on a busy saturday_afternoon and -PRON- have not be anywhere_else since
-PRON- be a small shop nothing extremely fancy or frilly but -PRON- be clean fair_price and hi do great work
-PRON- would_recommend make_an_appointment but walk_in be welcome -PRON- will just have to wait
if -PRON- be not do a gel color be limit but that do_not bother -PRON- because -PRON- mainly stick to red and pink
this gym have the most rude and condescend staff -PRON- have ever encounter
the ring leader be john m the sale manager
this guy strut around like a cock in a hen house
-PRON- have treat -PRON- and -PRON- mother so horribly that -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to work out at another la fitness
many of the trainer act_like -PRON- be too good to be there and be lazy
ask for help with a machine be never fun
-PRON- will not be renew -PRON- membership with la fitness and have make -PRON- a personal mission to spread the word of the negative ugliness john have foster at_this_location
-PRON- love_this_place
everyone here be nice and -PRON- care_about -PRON- client
-PRON- work in a healthcare profession and have to wash -PRON- hand a lot
the gel usually stay on pretty well
however when -PRON- chip this_place always keep up -PRON- end of the bargain with fix chip in gel nail within the first 7 day
ricky recently do -PRON- gel nail and -PRON- pedicure -PRON- be very_professional and polite
-PRON- also like that this nail_salon use disposable tub liner for the pedicure
this be probably one of the most below_average dining_experience -PRON- have ever have at a restaurant even with the 50 off group buy -PRON- be not worth -PRON-
the interior could be chic if -PRON- like that old congac and cigar feel but -PRON- be drag down by -disgusting
soiled carpet that be reminiscent of the cheap hotel in_vegas -old cheap leather chair that do_not wear like fine leather
-children
many of -PRON- kind_of spew food everywhere and no server to clean up table that have long leave
-a kind_of musty gross child leave thing sticky smell
-PRON- do_not_know_how -PRON- get the bad of both the -PRON- and the old man smell if either be to remain unbathed)-
but
yeah
-PRON- do -PRON-
the food -PRON- order th lamb and duck entree
the lamb be sooooo fatty and the risotto be more of a rice than a real risotto
the duck-
there be no meat on the duck
-PRON- be dry the grill veggie -PRON- come with be waaay oily and roast in the oven but not even well
service
the server be nice but just do_not care_about -PRON- job
-PRON- bring plate but no cutlery
just a terrible experience.\
aweful just aweful
the place be way_too busy and be very very disorganized
expect to wait a good while betweeen the time -PRON- order an item and the time -PRON- get say item
further expect to get only approximately half of the item -PRON- order and out of those half maybe half would be exactly as -PRON- request -PRON-
for_example i order the chicken cutlet without sauce instead get the pork cutlet with plenty_of sauce drench on_top order the sushi pizza without_any topping just the rice part without sauce instead get the the rice with mayo on_top order shrimp vegetable tempura get shrimp only
-PRON- get the idea
have to request the tempura 3 time before get -PRON- incorrectly as note above but at_least get some
the problem be that -PRON- have too_many table too_many patron and too_many staff that do_not_know_what s go on
also -PRON- do_not have an assign waiter -PRON- random waiters\/waitress that walk by and take order and other random waiter drop_off food at -PRON- table regardless of -PRON- be correct or not
there be no accountability with order
-PRON- have be to other ayce sushi place and yes there have be the occaisional glitch but the hit rate on ordrer i would estimate at 90 95 as_oppose to this_place where -PRON- 40 50
as_far as the quality of the food go i would say just average for most of the stuff except for the beef dish and teriaky salmon which be above_average
regardless i be ban this_place permanently and will not be go_back ever again
love the atmosphere
great customer_service
amazing drink
first_time come_here
every_time -PRON- go to a bbtea place -PRON- always get a taro milk_tea with bubble
why -PRON- may ask
-PRON- be because -PRON- seem simple but -PRON- be also the easy drink to mess_up
if a place can_not make -PRON- a good taro milk_tea with bubble -PRON- be out in -PRON- book
lucky for -PRON- -PRON- make -PRON- beautifully

-PRON- will be recommend -PRON- to friend and family
-PRON- show_up at two different location at two different time in_phoenix with out a reservation and both time there be an_hour and a half wait to get a table

have work in customer_service for 10_year and currently in sale management -PRON- know a thing or two
one thing -PRON- know for certain be that the customer_service at_this_location sucks
-two of the crew member be have an inappropriate conversation something about lesbian
-the young_lady that prepare -PRON- order do_not greet -PRON- just ask for -PRON- order
yes uh hello to -PRON- too
-there be absolutely no order
crew member walk to and from the register with customer wait and not say anything
-the ice on the cake be when -PRON- go up to the counter to ask for lid to put on -PRON- bowl
-PRON- toss one on the counter there be one
-PRON- go to get the second one
and -PRON- be hold -PRON- hand out at this point because have -PRON- toss that second one
-PRON- have to catch -PRON- -PRON- always hand the customer what -PRON- ask for
-PRON- will_never visit this_location again ever
-PRON- like come_here because -PRON- enjoy eat outside but -PRON- will not spend -PRON- money where -PRON- can_not even get decent service
today totally turn -PRON- off
-PRON- wish -PRON- have read these review before go and waste -PRON- money
service bad untrained food old no freshness and quality far below other hibatchi restaurant
management- this_place be family_own but no ownership be present be tell -PRON- can_not afford to refund an unhappy guest but would give -PRON- a $_20 gift_card to come_back to which would lead -PRON- to have to spend more money as the menu be over price
giant eagle have good sushi and pick_up some raman while -PRON- there
get -PRON- business together benny and train -PRON- management
-PRON- consider jersey mike 's one of the premium sub shop
-PRON- be on the high_end of the price scale but -PRON- quality be the reason for that
-PRON- fixin and bread be always very fresh and -PRON- slice the meat cheese to order
the employee be always friendly and chatty
-PRON- have a loyalty card that let -PRON- earn free sandwich
-PRON- have a_few tv_'s that always have the game on
because of the pricing -PRON- do_not go here more_than once a week because -PRON- can probably save $_3 at subway with a daily_special
-PRON- be a treat that -PRON- usually reserve for the weekend
but -PRON- look_forward_to -PRON- because -PRON- like -PRON- sandwich
if -PRON- do_not get the daily_special at subway then this would be -PRON- workweek place too
man this mall be huge
-PRON- have some of -PRON- favorite store such_as macy 's levi 's express and many more
the food court be cool as_well
the layout be a_bit weird though
see as -PRON- be -PRON- first_time visit this mall the weird escalator layout get -PRON- a_bit confused when -PRON- be try to reach some store
grant because -PRON- be a high_end mall -PRON- get -PRON- mix of tourist and white collar snob but nevertheless -PRON- be a nice mall
love love_this_place
i will definetly reccom -PRON- to friend and family
chef paco do a good job of make everyone tummy happy
this_place be just kind_of sad
-PRON- be a place that want to be a hipster cool kid kind_of hotel but be not
-PRON- be not retro
-PRON- be just old
-PRON- be not chic -PRON- be just tasteless
parking
=_=_=_= =_=_=_= =
one of the first thing -PRON- will notice about this hotel be that -PRON- be on a small lot
so small that -PRON- do_not actually have a place to pull_up in front of the hotel and check in like many traditional hotel do now
-PRON- be sure hipster would call this charming
-PRON- call this thoughtless
lobby =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =
the lobby be spartan
-PRON- share an entryway\/hallway with the very_popular gallo blanco restaurant
on a busy night -PRON- will be tot -PRON- luggage in or out of the hotel
past folk wait to get into the restaurant
room =_=_=_= =_=_=_= = many room open directly outside
think dress up motel-6
this be not a 4_star hotel by any stretch of the imagination and simply say -PRON- over and over again like -PRON- website do do_not make -PRON- so
walls be paper thin
music play almost constantly from the pool area
-PRON- shower do_not work at all for -PRON- -PRON- have to call maintenance to come look_at -PRON-
-PRON- room have a badly pixelated screen cap from the movie tombstone as artwork
if -PRON- come for a romantic getaway -PRON- pick the wrong motel
spa =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =
non_existent
this be false advertising on the part of the hotel -PRON- advertise as a spa even_though the website clearly state -PRON- will be opening in may
when -PRON- do finally open do_not get -PRON- hope up -PRON- look_like -PRON- will only be offer a_few type_of massage tea and spray tanning
room service =_=_=_= =_=_=_= = non_existent
again this be apparently a four_star hotel
-PRON- will for a $ 20\/day fee of_course provide all the wifi soda and snack think 100-calorie pack that -PRON- would care to ask for from the front_desk
since -PRON- book through expedia this be include in -PRON- hotel stay
stay classy clarendon
summary =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =
stay_away
there be many_other actual 4_star hotel in the phoenix_area
great selection
but i could buy some of the amino acid blend
let say -PRON- weigh 1\/4 kilo
-PRON- could get a kilo of every amino acid in -PRON- minimum 3 kilo for the 3 essential amino acid for muscle building
l- leucine l isoleucine and l valine
for less money from a trust source online
creatine
$_7 a kilo
not even -PRON- store brand come close to that
-PRON- would hate be a salesman there because i do_not overprice thing and the advice -PRON- would give be to go online
-PRON- be not get pay for this review
-PRON- just study biochemistry and like bodybuilding and hate when people waste -PRON- money
if -PRON- truly want source cheap_than any store message -PRON- the name of what -PRON- be look for
-PRON- may be able_to get -PRON- -PRON- for 150 more with half the cost include shipping

there be no need for syrup
mmmmmmmmmm
while -PRON- be no expert on bespoke suit or on tailoring -PRON- be very_impressed_with ali and -PRON- work
ali be extremely_friendly and knowledgeable
-PRON- clearly take -PRON- work very seriously and be very concerned that -PRON- get what -PRON- want and like the finished product
-PRON- find that most tailor be mildly arrogant and do_not share much of -PRON- process or method with -PRON- unless -PRON- spend_$ $_$
-PRON- actually take in a cheap make to measure suit -PRON- buy off the internet and ali give -PRON- great feedback on -PRON- quality and there be not a hint_of condescention that -PRON- bring in a cheap suit
-PRON- also let out the chest and stomach for $ 60.00
-PRON- be think of go_back for one of -PRON- bespoke suit once -PRON- get a little more money in the bank
-PRON- have be want to check_out ethel m chocolate forever finally do
-PRON- be in the middle_of nowhere about 20_min drive from the strip to henderson nv a neighboring town

now that -PRON- be a local in_las_vegas -PRON- find that this taxi company be not elite at all
-PRON- would honestly suggest avoid use ycs transportation whether -PRON- be a local in_las_vegas or a visitor
the reason -PRON- can wait_forever a never get a cab after -PRON- call
the people_who take the call sound exasperated and helpless

-PRON- be ironic that -PRON- would luv this brewery because -PRON- be not much of a drinker
-PRON- think what -PRON- luv about this_place be that -PRON- find a way to sneak the beer into food so that people_who can_not drink much but like to eat like -PRON- can still enjoy be there
-PRON- also enjoy that four peaks be one of those lay_back bar where the music be not pound so loud that -PRON- can_not have a conversation with the people sit right_next to -PRON-
there 's good food good staff good service good price and lot_of outdoor_seating so this be a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone

the atmosphere be comfortable and authentic just like -PRON- food
staff and owner be super attentive and polite
wahrscheinlich ein der größten buffet in_vegas geschmacklich mein erachtens nach eher durchschnitt und dennoch sollte für jeden etwa dabei sein
gerade nach einem langen
messetag kann man hi nochmal die reserven auffüllen
zu stoßzeiten sollte man etwa geduld am
eingang mitbringen oder
bei gruppen schonmal jemanden vorschicken
order a salad and wing way more expensive that -PRON- should be
service take ever for refill and the place be not even that busy
look_at the price on the entire menu everything be price an average of a dollar more_than expect
-PRON- be currently in possession of -PRON- first set of acrylic nail and whilst this do make -PRON- a lot harder to type than before -PRON- have to review this new nail_salon so that more people can go
although -PRON- have never go for full n acrylic before for fear of look_like a wannabe wag -PRON- have have -PRON- nail manicure enough to be able_to tell a rubbish place from a good one
and usa nailz definitely fall_into the latter category
-PRON- price be really reasonable -PRON- pay £ 25 for a full set include all the pre tratment and exfoliation etc but the high_quality of the finish be not reflect in how little -PRON- charge
for_example -PRON- use jessica nail polish along_with any upmarket salon in edinburgh and -PRON- be offer a tea or coffee several_time during -PRON- hour long treatment
and may -PRON- also just say that -PRON- have never have so_much banter with anyone perform any sort_of beautifying ritual on -PRON- before
although -PRON- nail_technician be very much a quiet type -PRON- friend 's could_not have be more different
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be giggle so_much that -PRON- feel sorry for -PRON- guy try to concentrate on what -PRON- be do as -PRON- be fidget around so_much
-PRON- have only just open so -PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- low price will hang around
but at the moment -PRON- be really good value for money even if -PRON- do_not want acrylic to get -PRON- own nail varnish and manicure be only £ 21 and if -PRON- just want -PRON- paint nicely before a special_occasion without_any of the treatment -PRON- will ony cost -PRON- £ 3
bargain
oh pizza pizza -PRON- have lose -PRON- delivery business for sure and most_likely -PRON- walk_in business as_well
-PRON- really do_not even like pizza pizza 's pizza
but sometimes -PRON- be just convenient
especially late at night
especially when -PRON- be in the middle_of painting and -PRON- be pour rain and -PRON- just can_not be bother to go out
that be when -PRON- call for delivery
-PRON- place -PRON- order and be tell that there be no time promise and -PRON- would be there when -PRON- be ready
ok
that be fine
-PRON- have a_few more wall to get through anyhow
-PRON- be hungry
but -PRON- be not go anywhere
-PRON- ask -PRON- to call and let -PRON- know when -PRON- be on -PRON- way
so -PRON- could go downstairs and let -PRON- in no buzzer
the guy on the phone say that -PRON- would note that on the order
so away -PRON- be work and -PRON- stomach be growl something fierce
-PRON- check the clock to see that -PRON- be be an_hour since -PRON- place -PRON- order so -PRON- call to see what be up
-PRON- give the guy on the phone -PRON- number and -PRON- double_check
-PRON- then inform -PRON- that there be no order with that number
wtf
-PRON- offer to replace the order
ummmm no
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would already wait an_hour
and -PRON- would just go to wendy_'s so to forget -PRON-
grrrrrrrrrr
at that point -PRON- be already tick
about 20-minutes later there be a knock at -PRON- door
-PRON- be the driver with -PRON- order
apparently the original phone guy input the wrong phone_number
so the driver be expect -PRON- to pay -PRON-
-PRON- ask if that be the same pizza that -PRON- would order over_an_hour before and -PRON- say yes
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be not pay_$ 25 for cold pizza sorry
-PRON- say ok and leave
not that -PRON- be expect -PRON- for free but really
a gesture could have be offer -PRON- to -PRON- for half if not complementary for -PRON- screw_up
at_least that would have ensure -PRON- give -PRON- another shot and feel good that -PRON- care to make the mistake right
but no
nothing
so -PRON- guess the guy back at the shop get to eat -PRON- spinach tomato mushroom and onion pizza
or maybe -PRON- go in the trash
either_way a total waste of -PRON- time and -PRON- product
fail
live in the neighborhood and visit various yogurt shop almost weekly do_not judge -PRON-
great first_impression
walk_in and be kindly greet_by the manager who immediately offer -PRON- some delicious sample
-PRON- start browse the yogurt and immediately impressed_with the selection
one showcase element -PRON- have that -PRON- have not see anywhere_else be provide a flavor description for when -PRON- combine the two at each machine
why have not -PRON- see this anywhere_else
ingenious but so simple
-PRON- then come around the corner offer more sample
can -PRON- tell -PRON- have a sweet_tooth
one of the machine splash out a_bit when try to sample a flavor so -PRON- immediately go to wash off -PRON- hand
bathroom be clean and smell that way
yes -PRON- be a new place
so the wear and tear will take a few_year but nice to see such a minor detail like the bathroom nice and clean
-PRON- inquire a little about -PRON- but be not pushy and as a manager -PRON- -PRON- be thoroughly impressed
well do yogurtini -PRON- just gain a loyal_customer
-PRON- also do the phone base reward where -PRON- earn free yogurt
obviously -PRON- like this feature since -PRON- frequent shop like this
-PRON- visit on a saturday_night around 7:30 and have no trouble find a table in one of the free seating area
upon_enter -PRON- notice multiple pinball machine and game include shuffleboard bowling and other video game
definitely a plus for -PRON-
-PRON- take a table upstairs and -PRON- find the environment to be fantastic there be music that be not too_loud and -PRON- could hear -PRON- friend speak and -PRON- server be friendly and helpful
-PRON- order a punch bowl as_well_as nachos to share
and -PRON- have the farmer 's salad with ahi_tuna
this review will be a_bit redundant if -PRON- list -PRON- reaction to everything so -PRON- will sum -PRON- up by say that everything -PRON- eat and drink be delicious
while the vegetarian_option be not ample -PRON- be there and -PRON- be easily able_to find several item -PRON- be interested_in
honestly -PRON- could_not have ask for a good night this restaurant be fantastic
always on the look out for bbq wherever -PRON- go
see these folk on tv this morning
so here -PRON- be
get the sliced beef po boy with corn bread and sweet_tea
this_place be a cool little joint seem_like -PRON- would be a great place to come eat and watch the tv
bbq be cook well black pepper crust and sweet corn bread be amazing
tea be good and -PRON- whole family enjoy -PRON-
good place to eat and price reasonable
not worth the expense
tamara c be -PRON- waitress -PRON- take a very long_time to get to -PRON- table to take -PRON- order
-PRON- have 2 other waitress help -PRON- and ask if -PRON- need anything before -PRON- ever get there
-PRON- order the 2 egg basic breakfast with turkey sausage which end really chicken sausage but the waitress do_not even tell -PRON- that
-PRON- ask for -PRON- to be well do well the sausage come_out not well do and the egg be very wet still and be not fully cook
when the waitress come_back to the table -PRON- ask if -PRON- could please take -PRON- back and have -PRON- cook well do
-PRON- answer be well
-PRON- tell -PRON- to make -PRON- well do
and then -PRON- roll -PRON- eye and take off to get some plate to transfer -PRON- undercooked underwhelming food back
-PRON- should have never roll -PRON- eye this be extremely unprofessional and -PRON- should have just say no_problem let -PRON- have that fix for -PRON-
when -PRON- be a waitress -PRON- never make -PRON- the customer fault although sometimes -PRON- could have be
-PRON- never put blame on -PRON- cook or anything of the sort
-PRON- just pleasantly say let -PRON- have that correct for -PRON-
so the moral of the story be -PRON- gas overwhelm by how many table -PRON- have which be very obvious and -PRON- should choose a new line of work since -PRON- be not cut out for that one
-PRON- will_never be back and that be not worth $_40 without the tip
oh and do -PRON- mention after all that crappy service -PRON- boyfriend decide -PRON- should still get a tip even_though -PRON- complain_about give -PRON- one
good_luck
oh -PRON- call the manager to let -PRON- know_what have happen with the waitress
-PRON- thank -PRON- and say -PRON- would address -PRON- with -PRON-

the owner be incredibly personable and just plain nice and even_though -PRON- be a one man outfit from what -PRON- remember and extremely in demand -PRON- be super quick
can_not recommend -PRON- enough friendly knowledgeable and reasonably_price so nice to be able_to say good thing and support local small business

-PRON- have a high_standard for chinese_food so most place do_not get the covet 5_star rating
peking garden be a weird case for -PRON- though
this_place be extremely hit or miss more so then -PRON- ever see a restaurant be
the first_time -PRON- go here with coworker the food be hot come quick and taste terrific
at the time -PRON- would have almost give -PRON- a 5_star rating
-PRON- be glad -PRON- do_not though
-PRON- go_back a second_time and the food come_out cold there be a long_wait and -PRON- do_not taste nearly as good
-PRON- go_back a third_time and this time the food be just average tasting
-PRON- entree be great but the soup and egg_roll taste weird
the service be also bad this trip
the 4th time -PRON- go_back though be what ultimately make the place deserve the 2_star rating as not only be the service terrible but -PRON- food take almost 45_minute to come_out and there be only three table fill in the restaurant
the bad part be that -PRON- and -PRON- girlfriend get food sickness from -PRON-
-PRON- be not fun especially_since -PRON- both have to work later that day
-PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- be from the egg_drop_soup
-PRON- have large chunk of either oil or raw egg in -PRON- and -PRON- be sick for nearly two week with stomach cramp

-PRON- enjoy the laksa there while -PRON- singaporean comrade be quick to point out that -PRON- be not authentic likely chime in from review
-PRON- read from many netizen before hand
-PRON- absolutely_love -PRON-
the only down side be that -PRON- have order the shirmp but -PRON- order get mix up and get the chicken instead

the staff be wickedly friendly the place be dim light and there be a lot_of chitter chatter between patron which -PRON- love
great place for date_night as -PRON- not too serious yet strangely have great potential for romance which one would not expect to find at a bar
brb as -PRON- make -PRON- way there now
this post make -PRON- miss the food
-PRON- use to live in the area but come_back for work recently and decide to find some chow that be not bar food
-PRON- remember this be a hoggy 's bbq joint a few_year_ago so when -PRON- walk_in the place look huge
fortunately -PRON- have class -PRON- up quite a_bit and -PRON- feel_like a nice modern restaurant
for the food -PRON- order the duck_confit mac and cheese and -PRON- coworker order the cuban sandwich
the duck_confit m&c be phenomenal
-PRON- really like how this restaurant take homestyle cooking to the next level and add some flare to -PRON-
the m&c come with a well put together side salad with fresh mixed green
-PRON- coworker 's testament to the cuban be that -PRON- be an above_average cuban with a really good artisan mustard on -PRON-
the chip on the side be fairly average lack of flare but then again -PRON- be chip
-PRON- also can_not resist creme_brulee when -PRON- find -PRON- on a menu
-PRON- be kind_of a cb snob
while oak barrel 's flavor be not anything imaginative -PRON- make -PRON- well the consistency be perfect and compare to other restaurant -PRON- give -PRON- a boatload of -PRON-
overall this_place really improve the dining quality in the area and be pretty modestly price for how good the food be
-PRON- love how all the indians be negatively rat this_place
yes the owner be a little grumpy most time -PRON- be a generation gap
think of -PRON- as that grumpy uncle each family have
this food be close to home

samosas be the good in south phx at_least

have chicken lo mein but do_not see the chicken -PRON- ask and be tell -PRON- there
oh really sure -PRON- be
and that and a million dollar
and -PRON- will win the lotto
as -PRON- taste the bowl of noodle there be a strong vinegar taste
not_sure if -PRON- have ever have lo mein that have a vinegar taste still try to figure that one out
maybe pickle get drop in the noodles?as -PRON- can see not many_people for lunch
but there be a long_line next_door at zaxbys?the king of fast_food huh

-PRON- change up the taco special daily and the taco shell be amazing
-PRON- love that -PRON- can choose a specialty taco and substitute any meat for_example if -PRON- come with tofu and -PRON- want chicken -PRON- will do that for -PRON-
-PRON- could ramble for day about how_much -PRON- love_this_place and -PRON- wish -PRON- could give -PRON- more_than 5_star
eh -PRON- be not such a huge_fan_of this_place
in truth the only_reason i ever go here be because -PRON- be on the guest_list and this be where everyone want to go
i really can_not understand_why anyone like this_place
the decor be cool but the layout of this_place be awkward to say the least
there be not a single place in the entire club where -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be be push into someone
the hallway be narrow with the whole club be really dimly lit
the dance_floor be way_too small and overly crowded
the music be ok but nothing to jump up and down for
the outside smoking area be long and narrow but also really crowd
1 reason not to go here the last_time i be there i keep bump into kevin fenderline
booooo
-PRON- have some ok clothe here and a_few bargain but terrible customer_service
someone totally cut -PRON- in line and the cashier do_not do a thing_about -PRON-
-PRON- walk_out without make a purchase
this_place be the most unwelcoming salon -PRON- have ever be to
walk_in to get a quote for a hair dye and stand at the door for 5_min and no one even_bother to ask if -PRON- could help -PRON- out of the 4 hairdresser that be there -PRON- make eye contact with at_least 2 of -PRON- and one additional hairdresser walk_in after -PRON- do and directly attend -PRON- friend
can_not believe -PRON-
what kind_of service do -PRON- offer when -PRON- do_not even greet -PRON- when -PRON- come in
do_not go here if -PRON- be look for good costumer service
this be obviously not the place to go
-PRON- love_this_place
today -PRON- have lunch with a friend and be very happy
-PRON- share the trio appetizer and be very satisfied
the guacamole be awesome the salsa be spicy and very_flavorful and the chipole dip be divine
-PRON- friend have the shrimp salad with rasberry vinagirette
-PRON- say the shrimp be flavorful and cook to perfection
the mixture_of sweet and tangy be a tasty combination
-PRON- have the caballero chicken salad with spicy chipole ranch
-PRON- love this salad because -PRON- be fresh crisp and so good
the chicken be charcol broil and melt_in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- be the perfect place for lunch with a friend
the service be friendly and quick
-PRON- have live downtown for 15_year and this be -PRON- go to place for chinese
the food be always hot tasty and -PRON- can_not beat the price compare to some of the other place downtown
-PRON- always get the orange chicken and shrimp fry_rice but the appetizer part of the menu be perfect for small get together like a game of throne night
-PRON- be give three_star because the place seem a_bit run_down
-PRON- only rent a uhaul truck from here
so -PRON- do_not_know the storage situation
in walk to the truck the people use the storage seem quite shady
the manager be nice and get -PRON- the truck i need and the return be seamless
-PRON- do_not try and fabricate any additional charge
-PRON- be just look for coffee other_than starbuck and this_place come up on_yelp
-PRON- almost drive_by -PRON- because -PRON- be in the heart of
what seem to be the ghetto
luckily -PRON- turn_around and decide to go -PRON-
be
so_glad -PRON- do
what a gem
cole greet -PRON- and provide -PRON- with a weatlth of info
not only be the coffee amazing but the food selection look good too

-PRON- be a great place to see a band and -PRON- have good beer_on_tap too
love -PRON- bmw -PRON- be kind_of amazing that none_of the sale staff here have ever respond to -PRON-
-PRON- be weird have request -PRON- call and let -PRON- know when -PRON- get in a use car that match -PRON- description
-PRON- stop in anyway as -PRON- only buy a use one and see -PRON- in person be important to -PRON-
-PRON- may by chance have what -PRON- like sit in -PRON- lot
be -PRON- the blonde hair
-PRON- buy a new use car at bmw in long beach
want to buy -PRON- in -PRON- neighborhood but could_not seem to get anyone interested_in help
just horrible
hosted 2 friend for breakfast
rude staff low quality food
total regret
definitely -PRON- favorite tex_mex place
-PRON- have be come to rosa 's for many_year
and -PRON- have not have any bad_experience
rosa 's be always one of the restaurant on -PRON- visit home from college list
first decor the place look nice but tile be everywhere
and yes -PRON- be pretty and colorful but sometimes -PRON- can be a little hard to keep -PRON- balance when walk to the bathroom and -PRON- chair will not stop rock
the cheap painting and plant be ok definitely good now than ten year_ago
overall not great but waayyy good_than el charro
second service
the service can be hit or miss
some day -PRON- seem_like -PRON- have enough server and thing be do in a timely_manner but some day the whole place be just off
like -PRON- will take_forever to get drink and then an eternity to get food and then -PRON- get sick and tired of wait to pay the server
so -PRON- end_up take -PRON- bill to the front counter and have whoever be up there ring -PRON- up
but those day be few and far between and most of the time the people be nice and quick
third food
as -PRON- mention -PRON- have be a regular for quite some time and so -PRON- have try everything on -PRON- menu and not one complaint
-PRON- usual be the shrimp_taco but -PRON- also enjoy anything beef especially the nachos
the only down side be probably -PRON- salsa -PRON- a_bit too watery and not spicy enough
but -PRON- ask for habanero sauce and that definitely punch up the spice
and while -PRON- enjoy the taste and texture of the food as -PRON- eat -PRON- -PRON- also greatly appreciate the fact_that -PRON- do_not mess -PRON- up later in the evening
most other mexican_food -PRON- have usually result in -PRON- re enact a traumatize scene from dumb and dumb but rosa 's do_not
all in all the food be good
in summary rosa 's be and will always be -PRON- standard for tex_mex
if -PRON- be a denizen of henderson this be the perfect spot to come to after a long night out
-PRON- friend and -PRON- retreat to this eatery after a night of perform and talk all night in a bar\/casino
the food be ample affordable and yummy
the staff be sweet and responsive but not_overly in -PRON- face
the menu be fairly straight_forward this be chain after all and there be decent parking out front
-PRON- love_this_place
-PRON- have be use this alteration shop for over_10_year
the lady be very_nice and -PRON- measurement be always spot on
-PRON- be short
so -PRON- need a lot_of -PRON- clothe shorten and take in
the price be very_reasonable and the turn_around time be quick
eat_here before
be good
but today -PRON- order the frittata with egg_white and -PRON- say -PRON- could_not do -PRON-
-PRON- be pre do
what
just leave no more to say
honestly -PRON- have be to four different beautician for a brazilian at_this_location
one girl only break the the hair off
so -PRON- be leave with hard scratchy spot everywhere and -PRON- do_not tweeze after
-PRON- hope -PRON- be one of -PRON- first_time
jackie be by_far the good
if -PRON- be a_bit weary about wax and -PRON- be -PRON- first_time -PRON- highly_recommend -PRON-
even if -PRON- have be wax for a while now -PRON- would still recommend -PRON-
-PRON- pull the strip off in one motion and then put pressure on the spot -PRON- just wax to alleviate the pain
-PRON- get almost all of the hair
so -PRON- usually will not have to put another strip on a spot -PRON- already wax
-PRON- also do a great_job tweeze what be leave so
-PRON- be completely bare and happy with the work
-PRON- do_not skimp out on -PRON- job
-PRON- would_highly_recommend the ingrown hair serum as_well
-PRON- work wonder
can -PRON- just say that the decor in this_place be amazing
-PRON- be absolutely so cute and very aesthetically pleasing
-PRON- come at ~5ish on a sunday so -PRON- be not crowd and the server be very_attentive
-PRON- get the kee mao and panang curry both level 3 in spiciness
-PRON- give -PRON- some hot_sauce and crush chili in bottle on the side because -PRON- do_not have any hot chili oil
the panang come with a side of rice and have lot_of vegetable in -PRON-
the kee mao also have lot_of veggie
-PRON- wish there be more noodle in the dish but -PRON- be still pretty_good
-PRON- feel_like the place be kind_of pricey for the amount_of food -PRON- get especially in comparison to place like noodlehead
-PRON- be still pretty_good and -PRON- enjoy -PRON- experience here
this be an outstanding lagree studio and -PRON- have be to some of the good in the country
-PRON- would rate hsm|core as one of -PRON- arthur and -PRON- entire staff understand this machine and have brilliantly write routine
-PRON- heart rate be constantly high -PRON- be drip sweat and be shake like a mac truck on an unpaved road
-PRON- take class from francie kristi and dayron and really_enjoy each one
-PRON- mean when -PRON- say enjoy more like -PRON- could_barely walk at the end
but -PRON- truly challenge -PRON-
mind+body just the kind_of workout that leave -PRON- want more

time to tag tacos huicho to thursday 's tasty tantalizing taco trek -PRON- be the top -PRON- will tickle those tonsil
-PRON- have have -PRON- fill of standing in hour long_line at central phoenix 's other late_night
taco stand just a_few mile away on camelback which send -PRON- in search of something just as good but not such a burden on -PRON- patience
-PRON- have visit tacos huicho for lunch -PRON- have be here for dinner and yep also late_night
while not quite as late_night as the spot open until 2_a.m. -PRON- be happy to serve until midnight on the weekend which be plenty late enough for -PRON- the few_time -PRON- have be crave a taco past 10_p.m.
-PRON- have get taco at 1.50 per and in -PRON- opinion well_worth the price
-PRON- be not a full service restaurant so do_not come in expect table service
during -PRON- day time business hour -PRON- can find -PRON- cook inside behind the counter but visit in the evening on the weekend and -PRON- will find -PRON- cook outside on -PRON- cooktop grill
maybe -PRON- easy on the ventilation maybe -PRON- be easy than have the 10_minute long_line of people wait inside maybe -PRON- be because -PRON- outdoor grill can cook more food than -PRON- indoor grill
whatev the reason -PRON- be do something right
a little known secret to -PRON- success -PRON- think be -PRON- uber delicious hot salsa
every order of food from -PRON- grill come with a serving of -PRON- and -PRON- burn so good
not in a -PRON- can_not even taste the salsa
this be so hot but in a -PRON- taste this awesome sauce and a_few moment later -PRON- can really feel the burn kind_of way
get some -PRON- will not be sorry -PRON- do unless -PRON- do_not like spicy food then -PRON- would suggest -PRON- avoid -PRON-
-PRON- will be back for sure the only real question be just how long can -PRON- go without make a stop back in
happy yelping phoenix eat more taco
go to this_place for a dinner presentation
slowest service -PRON- have ever encounter for such an event and -PRON- have be to many
salads arrive about 45_minute after the program start and -PRON- be almost two hour before the first dinner plate hit the table
when -PRON- contact the manager this be explain away by say that the presenter request a 20-minute lag between ordering and preparation there be a_bit of a difference_between 20_minute and almost two hour
go to another presentation about a week_later at another place and -PRON- be do with everything include dessert in 15_minute less_than -PRON- take gb to just bring -PRON- -PRON- entree
-PRON- can_not say how good the food be because -PRON- have to choke -PRON- down in order to get home by 10 pm from a presentation that begin at 6:30

-PRON- take_awhile for the waiter\/waitress -PRON- have different waiter wait -PRON- table to come to -PRON-
-PRON- proceed on order a general tao with rice and a chef_'s choice of sushi on a boat may i add
kinda tacky if -PRON- ask -PRON-
-PRON- come with a choice of hot and sour_soup or win ton soup
-PRON- have one of each
the hot and sour_soup have freeze mixed vegetable and be not hot nor sour
the win ton be like the one -PRON- would find in a chinese buffet
not off to a good start
then the general tao be oily saggy and way_too sweet
the rice be ok
-PRON- take_forever for the sushi to get to -PRON- table and -PRON- wine bottle be not open yet
when -PRON- finally get -PRON- sushi boat -PRON- be not impressed_by -PRON-
-PRON- be not unbeatable
-PRON- could of beed better that be for sure and the combination of litchi with salmon be off put to -PRON-
at 60 $ + tax for 29 piece be quite expensive for this poor_quality of sushi
come_here do_not ruin -PRON- night
but i be certainly not come bad
the service be bad
the food not so good and -PRON- be loud enough to be unpleasant
maybe -PRON- be not -PRON- night
maybe -PRON- be short staffed
that be too_bad
-PRON- wish i could give more star
large spacious dark atmosphere but nice expensive decor
food be pricey to obtain the 4 food group
decline to spend_$ $_$ $ just arrive via princess of wales prisscella so opted for a simple multi leaf blk olive artichoke heart salad with salad dress switch of lemony\/olive dressing instd
of cheese and garlic dressing
actually -PRON- ask for -PRON- custom make because -PRON- could_not afford to eat anything_else
pieces need to be cut to bite size because -PRON- be the last person to finish
when -PRON- look up everyone be star at -PRON- -PRON- embarrassingly respond alot of chew and do -PRON- look_like an oriental rabbit yet
a group_of 5 theatre goer out of 12 roarred out laugh
break some silence
tea be nice and welcome ~ $_2
t\/t = $_16
restrooms be dark and bite tight clean well_maintain

other_review not promise enough not surpriz if this business fail
-PRON- better get a good chef or great cook asap
before -PRON- be way_too late
-PRON- go here only for the macaron
but base off how delicious -PRON- be -PRON- would certainly come_back to try other item
delicious
-PRON- walk_in friday_night at 5:45 and there be only a_few people din but within 20 30_minute -PRON- start fill_up
good to be lucky than good with the timing

try -PRON- -PRON- will like -PRON-
look for a close inexpensive restaurant on a saturday_night at 7_p.m.
see this on_yelp and decide to try -PRON-
the place be nearly empty but could handle a crowd of 100
service be quick
no draft_beer
but that be okay

for what i pay for the room and the size of -PRON- be great
everything there seem to be break but what can -PRON- do the bed be nice and the shower work
so i do_not complain to much here
the gym on the 3rd floor be horrible do_not go there
all the machine be break and there miss the bar to the weight machine so -PRON- very_limited on -PRON- exercise there

have to use a towel for a pull bar since the bar be all miss
the casino seem run_down and pretty empty there
-PRON- nice because -PRON- walking_distance to the golden nugget
so i gamble there most of -PRON- trip
the food at the plaza be not to good be good off walk down the strip to find a decent place to munch on something -PRON- would stay_here_again just for the room
but i would not gamble workout or eat_here
the only_reason this_place be get two_star from -PRON- be for the view
-PRON- be here for a bachelorette_party and purchase a groupon for vip bottle service and -PRON- still be not cheap
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- act_like -PRON- have_no_idea what the groupon be and try to tell -PRON- -PRON- be only for 1 drink per guest
after wait and argue for a while -PRON- be finally give what -PRON- pay for but then the waitress come and state -PRON- could_not give -PRON- the bottle until -PRON- pay gratuity
huge chunk of change
after -PRON- pay -PRON- bring the bottle and disappear for the rest_of the night
-PRON- do_not see -PRON- again
great view and decent music
but -PRON- experience be horrible with -PRON- customer_service
-PRON- definitely will_never be return here

excellent experience at byblos
-PRON- be a group_of 4 and share the labneh ceviche mussel dumpling brussel_sprout sweet jewel rice and lamb and be all full by the end
-PRON- also share the donut for dessert
the standout be the labneh and lamb and -PRON- be normally not a lamb person
great vibe and service
-PRON- would be happy to go_back
here be -PRON- website where -PRON- can view the menu http:\/\/www.teakwoodstavern.com\/ -PRON- go here because -PRON- hubby be crave hot_wing and

-PRON- get the candlestick carver sandwich and love -PRON-
-PRON- be basically a french_dip on sourdough with horseradish and green chili make with prime_rib and melted cheese
2 die 4
-PRON- will_definitely go again for some good grub and brew
-PRON- have never write a yelp_review before
but -PRON- just have a terrible experience with this_company
-PRON- call for a taxi from lakewood to the airport a 15_minute drive
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- do_not help with -PRON- bag and basically say nothing the entire trip not even a be -PRON- warm enough
upon arrive -PRON- find out the bill be go to be $_35 which be overprice for the duration of the trip
-PRON- have take taxi often and -PRON- generally about a $_20 ride
then when -PRON- arrive -PRON- pay with -PRON- card sign and be ready to get out of the car -PRON- also happen to smell of cigarette not what -PRON- expect give the cost of the trip when the driver turn and have the audacity to ask if -PRON- want to tip -PRON-
-PRON- be a generally uncomfortable experience and -PRON- will_never use -PRON- again
tasty smoothie healthy fresh make and variety on the menu
price be pretty fair compare to other juice bar
-PRON- be not too knowledgeable on health food but -PRON- question get answer
military and veteran discount available
super_friendly staff
-PRON- feel_like this be the place that -PRON- gringos be look for when -PRON- be try to get the inside scoop on the good mexican_food hide gem in the city
pittsburgh be a good place now that onion maiden exist

bring a doubtful friend_who be not vegan and -PRON- love -PRON-
the ragoon yes
the hotdog unique and interesting
the woods

everything be remodel and totally improve so ignore negative_review just see for -PRON-
go there on 8\/4\/17 6 yo 3 yo both love -PRON- the kiddie ride be great for -PRON- lot_of -PRON-
storm make -PRON- leave earlier than expect but great park no the less
judge by the number_of positive review that have be filter -PRON- would hazard a guess that some of the other that do_not get filter be fake too
or maybe -PRON- be supremely unlucky
here be -PRON- experience with el cheapo
the crew john and willy arrive at approximately 10:30 am on the schedule move date
soon after -PRON- begin to move -PRON- belonging -PRON- notice that -PRON- be not handle item quite as gently as -PRON- would expect a train mover to do
for_example -PRON- witness willy lean a piece_of furniture against artwork on -PRON- wall
who do that
-PRON- have a slightly uneasy feeling because -PRON- reek of stale booze and cigarette and consider hover over -PRON- from the start of the move but think -PRON- would be respectful enough to let -PRON- do -PRON- thing as -PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- have do many move
and -PRON- figure
that base_on all the positive review el cheapo have online
soon after -PRON- start move stuff from -PRON- condo down to the truck -PRON- notice that -PRON- would take -PRON- a lot longer to come_back up from the truck than -PRON- take -PRON- to load the elevator to go down
there be several occasion when -PRON- take item down in the elevator and do_not come_back for 20 25 minute
-PRON- check on -PRON- during one of these delay and find -PRON- sit inside the rear of the truck smoke with -PRON- thing
this be at approximately noon within 1.5 hour of start
on -PRON- way to the house -PRON- be follow closely behind -PRON- vehicle easily visible in the rear view mirror though -PRON- have also give -PRON- specific direction to the address
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have a gps so no_problem
as -PRON- near the house the truck disappear for approximately 20_minute
-PRON- try call in case -PRON- have get lose but -PRON- do_not answer the first_time -PRON- call
the second_time -PRON- manage to get through but -PRON- provide no explanation or apology nor an_excuse that -PRON- be lose for go miss for 20_minute while on the clock
all tell by -PRON- calculation -PRON- waste over_an_hour of clock time by way of several smoke break and the mysterious truck disappearance on the way to the house
when -PRON- arrive at the house be when thing go from bad to bad
at some point during the move -PRON- tear a leg off -PRON- entertainment console and do_not notify -PRON- that there have be an incident
when -PRON- notice -PRON- and ask where the leg go john tell -PRON- -PRON- be in the truck
no explanation or apology
ironically -PRON- have offer to wrap\/secure this item prior to any move as -PRON- be one of -PRON- favourite piece
and -PRON- want to ensure -PRON- arrive unscathed but john and willy tell -PRON- in a condescend tone that -PRON- be not necessary as -PRON- know better_than -PRON- what -PRON- be do
other item be damage in the move with john and willy include the floor in -PRON- new house
as mention above any time -PRON- offer to wrap up item to protect -PRON- better or make -PRON- more secure -PRON- respond in a condescend tone that -PRON- have do this a million time and that -PRON- be not necessary for -PRON- to help make -PRON- job easy
ironically every piece_of furniture -PRON- offer to wrap be damage
when -PRON- start unload box at the destination -PRON- do_not ask -PRON- where box should go and ignore the labelling on the box so box that should have go to the basement or kitchen end_up upstairs
-PRON- enter the house with one of -PRON- dresser that look as though -PRON- have be drag across the pavement the edge of all the drawer be shear off
when -PRON- ask john what have happen to the dresser -PRON- completely ignore -PRON-
after -PRON- notice the first piece_of furniture be damage
-PRON- ask that -PRON- be careful with the next piece_of furniture and john reply depend_on how_much -PRON- tip
no joke
after see damage on every piece_of furniture john and willy bring into the house -PRON- could_not allow -PRON- to continue move anything_else off the truck for fear of further damage
at this point -PRON- instruct -PRON- to stop move anything and -PRON- continue to be snarky and unapologetic
-PRON- call toby and ask -PRON- to send another crew
the new crew arrive roughly 2_hour later and be much good
unfortunately though by this point a significant amount_of furniture have irreparably be damage
-PRON- be leave feel very unsettled by this situation as the reason -PRON- hire mover in the first place be that -PRON- think -PRON- would be more careful with -PRON- thing than -PRON- friend
-PRON- have prepare -PRON- for some minor scratch and ding but this be well beyond what one may consider normal wear and tear from a reputable move company
unfortunately despite the promise at the time to compensate -PRON- in some way for destroy so_many of -PRON- belonging el cheapo do nothing to resolve the issue and make excuse every_time -PRON- call to follow_up
if -PRON- be into soya bean product and food this be the place to go
this_location of yan woo suppose to be the 16th location of this hong_kong base franchise
-PRON- have -PRON- since -PRON- be a child when -PRON- be in hong_kong
and -PRON- be so_glad -PRON- open one in_toronto
-PRON- sweet tofu pudding be so good
prepared freshly everyday in the store
-PRON- can pick either hot or cold version or -PRON- can have different flavour with red_bean green_bean black sticky_rice -PRON- favourite peanut almond and much_more
-PRON- also have seating that -PRON- can order little snack to eat in
-PRON- have fry noodle congee rice roll fry tofu
-PRON- can also buy family pack sweet tofu pudding tofu soy bean drink sweet or unsweetened
-PRON- really have to try the tofu pudding
-PRON- be like silk
just slide into -PRON- throat good
cash_only
delicious when -PRON- come to creativity akaihana sushi and grill set the bar
do_not expect the usual lineup of everyday sushi akaihana sushi and grill be the place to explore taste variation
as -PRON- walk_into akaihana sushi and grill -PRON- immediately get the feeling of be at -PRON- favorite local spot
the staff be welcome accommodate and will even help -PRON- navigate the special and regular menu entree
-PRON- order appetizer sashimi and maki roll from the daily_special and regular menu and be impressed
everything be very fresh and delicious
price be wallet friendly and the variety_of sushi_roll will satisfy everybody 's crave and for the non sushi eater akaihana 's offer cook entree as_well
if -PRON- be crave sushi stop_by -PRON- will not be disappoint
excellent service
creative menu beer_selection
thought both be outstanding
definitely_recommend the barley wine
have a 10 am appointment here on wed\/2 aug orrin the general_manager be professional and friendly
-PRON- go for the a $ 164.99 lifetime alignment service = $ 189.99 $_25 coupon thru the firestone.com website -PRON- can get this offer for $ 169.99 which be still a deal b
$ 71.96 lifetime balance rotation -PRON- be do in under 2_hour and inform -PRON- the result of -PRON- alignment pre and post fix even give -PRON- a print out
-PRON- also say -PRON- test -PRON- car battery and recommend a replacement
as -PRON- do_not sell -PRON- size car battery or any battery at all -PRON- be not look just to make an upsale
unfortunately this store do_not have tire nitrogen refill
the firestone alignment\/balance+rotation lifetime service be valid at any of -PRON- store nationwide so -PRON- will really pay off for -PRON- in the long run
have a
-PRON- buy -PRON- tire thru costco costco would have provide lifetime balancing rotation flat repair and nitrogen refill at costco 's with nitrogen the summerlin costco have -PRON-
previously -PRON- have use bob scher 's goodyear for a one time fix which come_out to be a $ 69.95 alignment
b $ 51.80 tire balance rotation
so -PRON- be definitely glad -PRON- buddy mention that firestone offer lifetime service at a fair_price
-PRON- order from thai original bbq due_to -PRON- usual thai place be close for renovation and -PRON- must_say -PRON- be a welcome change
-PRON- may have to switch to this_place
really really_enjoy bouillon bilk
the atmosphere be very trendy\/modern and upscale with an expansive wine_list the sommelier be a good resource
menu be relatively small which -PRON- like with about a half_dozen starter the same number_of main and some daily_special
-PRON- order one of those special the guinea fowl for -PRON- main and -PRON- be really really awesome
the cavatelli appetizer with truffle and other goody be also excellent
this would be a five_star meal if not for the portion_size which be extremely small for a large price_tag
a favorable exchange rate do help but -PRON- be a lot_of money for what -PRON- get which admittedly be an_excellent excellent fine_dining experience
-PRON- meal for two people include two appetizer two main one dessert one cup of tea and a bottle_of wine
total price be over $_200 canadian which be worth -PRON- for a splurge
definitely make a reservation if -PRON- be go to come
the price be great
and there be a lot_of choice as_far as name brand or off brand
-PRON- be great for vegetarian\/vegan option for many different price_range
however this_location be always just kind_of a mess
the bathroom be either close for clean or just completely dirty which make no sense to -PRON-
also the aisle be already almost too skinny for two of -PRON- wide cart to fit through so when product be stack in the middle instead_of stock on the shelf or store in back -PRON- be just difficult to get through aisle when there be multiple people
overall the grocery company be great -PRON- just think this_location need some work
especially because -PRON- think -PRON- reach a wide clientele and have a big location
the first_time -PRON- find slider truck be a_bit of an_accident
take a wrong turn and end_up right in front of -PRON-
would have be the good accident ever except that the guy in front of -PRON- get the last burger
-PRON- have be want to go_back ever since and finally get around to -PRON- yesterday
now that -PRON- have taste what -PRON- have be miss out on for all these month -PRON- be hooked
-PRON- order -PRON- hash slider and sweet_potato_fry
-PRON- have always be a fan_of the concept of sweet_potato_fry but have only have one good experience with -PRON- before now
-PRON- do -PRON- right
-PRON- just wish -PRON- have small take out container because when -PRON- get -PRON- slider home -PRON- be completely demolish
still taste great though
-PRON- have be here quite a_few time and let -PRON- give -PRON- the tl;dr about the place
the traditional hotdog with a bunch_of different stuff on_top_of -PRON-
-PRON- be a hotdog lover and -PRON- have try every_single regular dog on the menu
and -PRON- like -PRON- most of the time
except that -PRON- be just that odd time when something come_out a_bit strange or not quite right that make -PRON- dock one_star
-PRON- go to this_place june 9th and -PRON- be pretty quiet the people be super_friendly and the food be decent though -PRON- only big complaint be that when i go their for lunch with -PRON- two friend -PRON- have all order about the same 2 roll and a salad\/miso soup and the order for the girl come right_away and then 20_minute after -PRON- food come and -PRON- have finish -PRON-
-PRON- food for have finally come and there be no one be in the restaurant besides -PRON-
-PRON- just when i go out to lunch with friend i like to eat together
so that be disappointing
but the food be good average not outstanding but not bad
really glad -PRON- find the american guardian
hear_about -PRON- from -PRON- accountant and decide to go_ahead and rent a safe deposit box while -PRON- be on_vacation in_vegas

-PRON- really like -PRON- that -PRON- have mix and match option for -PRON- pasta dish
good beer_selection and good music

if ever in t.o. again would definitely_come_back here
really_enjoy -PRON- time at beachland ballroom when -PRON- drive down to see nada surf play a week or so ago
the venue be a nice size without feel too huge or too small
some of -PRON- favorite venue have a similar size\/feel about -PRON- schubas in chicago for one and this one join -PRON- rank
-PRON- be hot as hade outside but
inside -PRON- be actually almost cold which -PRON- appreciate especially_since -PRON- venue of similar size in detroit be not air condition
holy hell
every spot have a great view the sound be fabulous and the staff be out of control nice
-PRON- walk up to the bar and ask the bartender for a g&t for -PRON- and a tasty local beer for -PRON- fella who want to sample some of cleveland 's fine
-PRON- ask -PRON- a_few question include what kind_of beer -PRON- like to drink and hand -PRON- over a tasty double ipa from great lakes brewing

a_few shouter but nothing crazy
-PRON- actually leave without -PRON- blood pressure rise
thumb_up
excellent venue that -PRON- be sure -PRON- will be visit again the future especially_since -PRON- be surprisingly not that far about 2.5 hour from detroit
an easy trek if someone -PRON- really want to see be play there
this_place be the ultimate two_star
if -PRON- have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in pittsburgh this be the place to go
unfortunately mike tony 's close by 6_p.m.
-PRON- will not get good service -PRON- will get freeze french_fry toss in the deep fryer serve in disappointingly small_portion
-PRON- will have to scrounge around for a bottle_of ketchup and hot_sauce
however the gyro meat be freshly cut off the spit and the over stuff sandwich be a good deal at $ 4.30
overall there be not that many cheap place open at night downtown so go here if -PRON- be strand and can_not stand the thought of another sammy 's corned_beef sandwich
otherwise hold out for one of downtown 's great lunch spot
-PRON- girl viki and -PRON- have a late breakfast here on saturday morning
-PRON- be not pack thankfully because -PRON- be starve
-PRON- order a large sandwich combo that come with fresh make chip and drink
the sandwich be huge make for four people -PRON- seem load with premium meat and fresh product on freshly bake bread
the chip be alright

plan to arrive_early if -PRON- want to grab a table particularly on a weekend because new zealand cafe do great business
yes -PRON- be in a strip_mall and no the ambiance do_not draw -PRON- in but the fresh sushi and range of roll sure do
the pricing be more_than fair although -PRON- can_not say that -PRON- have try the $_1 roll
seem a little risky to -PRON- unless -PRON- be vie for a sick day from work
-PRON- be a sucker for a good caterpillar roll always as_well_as anything involve unagi and there be plenty_of eel option
-PRON- mister try some tuna sashimi when -PRON- be there last and -PRON- be outrageously good
earl_'s be a decent chain that -PRON- would rate above the usual milestone's\/moxie' type place but below joey which be own by the same company
the ambiance be nice -PRON- have huge stone pillar massive airy room a large patio great seating and tasteful decor
there be a decent number_of beer_on_tap and -PRON- have -PRON- own house beer which be respectable and the service be great
the food be pretty average
in -PRON- most_recent_trip -PRON- have the bronx burger which be decent but nothing to write_home_about
compare to joey 's menu which -PRON- love -PRON- just do_not think earl_'s be as good
also if -PRON- do_not work in finance -PRON- may find this_place a little off putting
-PRON- be all douchey guy in suit hit on gal in tight dress
-PRON- prefer to eat in place with a great mix of people
in_las_vegas and try gordon ramsey 's but the good burger -PRON- have be here
however be from california -PRON- favorite burger joint be still
in n_out burger a double double protein style and animal style one of -PRON- favorite gourmet chef be hubert keller and this be -PRON- burger restaurant in_vegas

the pizza be huge

-PRON- want chinese_food close to fountain hill but after hear_about some of the other place -PRON- be hesitant to try this one

-PRON- have to say -PRON- be rush on the drive home because the food smell amazing
-PRON- order the curry_chicken lunch_special with hot and sour_soup and the spicy pepper beef lunch_special with eggdrop soup
yea -PRON- a lot for one person
but -PRON- honestly do_not expect to like both
so -PRON- figure at_least one would be good
-PRON- be so pleasantly_surprised when -PRON- open the bag and everything be neatly pack egg_roll in a seperate package so -PRON- do_not get soggy utensil hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce
the food be so so so good the chicken be definitely a fusion between thai and chinese but -PRON- work well and the chicken be moist and tender
the spicy pepper beef be also tender and spicy and quite frankly pretty amazing
the soup be just ok kind_of bland for -PRON- taste but the eggroll be the perfect_balance between crisp and greasy
-PRON- highly reccomend this_place
if -PRON- be want to go out and see a pro basketball game the charlotte bobcats be the team and the time warner cable arena be the place to go
the suite rock
the arena still have that new smell
the game be fun loud and regardless of who win some good bball be play
-PRON- wish the bobcat would do better and hop with mj as owner -PRON- will get some more big time name to come play here
the staff here be very_friendly and the restroom be mostly clean
the food all smell great too -PRON- will have to try more of the food next_time but_hey the pizza and beer rock
-PRON- have see a concert here and -PRON- be a grand stage for sure for any large act even_though -PRON- prefer a small venue like the visualite great yelp event last_night and -PRON- be great meeting some of -PRON-
hard to find the place because -PRON- be inside of another place
-PRON- then order through a small rectangular hole_in the wall
-PRON- get the italian beef -PRON- be okay owner claim the beef be import -PRON- should have import the roll and broth as_well
the roll be toast and the -PRON- be give a bowl of beef broth to dip
-PRON- sandwich in
water be free and self service
the place have a bad smoke smell do to the bar remember a place inside another place
one of the good dim_sum place -PRON- have be to in a while
if -PRON- want to get here before 11_a.m. for the $_3 special make_sure -PRON- wake_up early
there be usually a big line up by 10:45am
the food taste clean and fresh than a lot_of other place
-PRON- can tell that -PRON- put into the effort to make the dumpl filling or pastry in house
service be typical of other dim_sum place
wave for service be recommend
the bay and dundas location just renovate so -PRON- be a nice stop to enjoy bubbletea with friend or on -PRON- own
the server be quick to get -PRON- order ready

service be superb
owner john make a visit and be very_personable
beer be good and necessary to wash down the tasty and spicy crustacean
-PRON- will always go_back
-PRON- friend and manager talk up this_place like if -PRON- be the great thing ever
-PRON- 1st year anniversary come around and think this would be a good spot
-PRON- really do_not_know_what i be expect atmosphere food quality elegance etc
but i be really disappointed
if -PRON- be go to benihana make
sure -PRON- go to the teppanyaki grill instead_of the lounge because the lounge be no good_than eat at panda express
the 5 course meal $ 31 in which i count 4 include a soup which be good the salad be subpar the main_course be cold and the desert be probably the good part and -PRON- be just ice_cream
the waiter be polite and look_like -PRON- be really busy even_though the restaurant be nowhere close to be 30
so i guess -PRON- be understaffed
-PRON- be guess the chef prepare all of 5 course at once the moment -PRON- place -PRON- order because by the time -PRON- go to -PRON- main_course -PRON- be cold the dipping_sauce for the steak be watery and not thick for -PRON- to stay on the food
-PRON- be embarrassed because -PRON- be -PRON- 1st year anniversary and eat at red lobster the previous week be way good for around the same price
-PRON- be never come_here again not even for the teppanyaki grill
and i would_rather go_somewhere_else hell
even olive_garden run circle around this_place
ruth 's chris

-PRON- guess be that lee c be go to respond to this review like the countless other one_star review and apologize
well there be a ton_of apology from several month_ago
and -PRON- do_not look_like anything have change
-PRON- should have consider the review before come_here -PRON- mistake

what a joy to finally come across_town and eat at cornish pasty
locate_in the arts district on downtown lv -PRON- may miss -PRON- drive_by by -PRON- unassum exterior
however once walk past the massive iron and wooden door -PRON- be greet with a dark eclectic interior with a british pub flare
there be some long communal eating table fit with church pew for seat and of_course many two and four or more table with chair
overhead lighting be dim and each chandelier or fixture be different from the next
on one side of the bar there be also pool_table and shuffleboard table and kitchen in the middle the other side a large bar with a plethora of beer_on_tap many speciality craft from different brewery and full spirit and wine
since meat pie be the main staple call pasty actually -PRON- know the british influence for colorful analogy be apparent
there be so_many choice -PRON- be almost too hard to choose
-PRON- also have appetizer such_as tandoori wing outstanding parliament wing delicious jalapeño bean dip with house make pita chip that be something special salad and soup everything in unique and creative flavor
now onto those pasty
as -PRON- mention before the wide_selection be almost too hard to choose
-PRON- choose the chicken tikka_masala -PRON- fondness of indian win -PRON- over
-PRON- be spicy and delicious a tad too heavy on the green bell pepper flavor for -PRON- taste but the red spicy curry_chicken and cub potato be still excellent
would still order again
-PRON- hubby order -PRON- fave meat pie chicken pot pie\/pasty a standard mix of pea potato carrot in a toothsome gravy -PRON- say -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- two pal join -PRON- order the guinness stew pasty steak potato etc
in a guinness spike gravy
-PRON- other companion decide on the roast dinner pasty steak candy carrot potato brussels sprout in a cheese and rutabaga gravy
-PRON- say -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- have red meat pork chicken fish and vegetarian choice
dessert be order although -PRON- be so stuff -PRON- decide on the apple caramel pie with vanilla ice_cream so scrumptious and the dark_chocolate bread_pudding which be heavy but divine
service be awesome -PRON- server be attentive friendly and expeditious
total bill minus tip for four pasty three appetizer two dessert 4 microbrew and a vodka club be $ 140
not bad for the pleasing atmosphere food and service
will_definitely_return

the price point be much cheap then -PRON- favorite popcorn store garret 's out of chicago
this popcorn be much healthy and offer popcorn for all dietary need
doc popcorn even ship popcorn to -PRON- home or as gift
what -PRON- be most impressed_by be -PRON- finger be not all oily -PRON- can tell this popcorn be make not to hit the hip but a natural treat
-PRON- also admire how tasty the flavor be
-PRON- offer a deal for popcorn and a drink\/and or icee
much cheap treat then the movie

-PRON- also have a dining_room with table and tatami room in the back where -PRON- would personally love to go for a birthday dinner
-PRON- be about_10 15_minute off the strip and in -PRON- opinion totally_worth -PRON- whether -PRON- be a local or in_town for vacation

from the kitchen -PRON- personally like the osaka rice sushi rice masago crab sauce
-PRON- family be split between the empura soft_shell_crab with ponzu sauce and the soft_shell katsu with scream sauce- both be a great appetizer to split

the one critique -PRON- may make
-PRON- love yellowtail
and although -PRON- can order item not on the conveyor belt that do have yellowtail -PRON- be not typically include in the standard rotation and find -PRON- waitress can be a little challenging if -PRON- be especially busy

-PRON- -PRON- friend make_reservation for this_place for a saturday_night
owner man
-PRON- speak to on the phone be extremely_rude
-PRON- mention that -PRON- may have a_few extra people and -PRON- say -PRON- would have to stand and anyone_who do_not show_up -PRON- will charge_$ 80 per_person
after this kind_of treatment -PRON- start look_at other place to go to and when -PRON- call to cancel the owner laugh and hang_up

will_definitely be back
be wäre waiblingen ohne das tagblatt direkt be marktplatz
gibt es be schönere al
ausgiebig
-PRON-
be tagblatt lecker
zu frühstücken und so seinen
tag zu beginnen
absoluter kultladen mit fairen preisen
egal ob für_ein
mittagessen oder zum frühstück oder auf nen kaffee oder auch abends auf ein bier
-PRON- be
tagblatt ist man immer gut aufgehoben
die netten kellner und_die tolle
terasse tun ihr übriges
in all fairness -PRON- have only ever have the cod tacos but -PRON- be so good
-PRON- come_back 3 day in a row for more
the fish be crispy and perfectly sized to fill not spill the taco
-PRON- be pretty picky about tortilla but these have a nice texture not the dry rubbery one that come from that fish_taco chain and the cabbage sauce be fresh and tasty
-PRON- could_not stop think about these taco and have to go again
and again
the price be right about 7 buck for the two taco and 2 side rice which -PRON- like and typically do_not and the bean which -PRON- really like
for -PRON- the portion be perfect for lunch just enough that -PRON- could_barely poke -PRON- all into -PRON- smallish appetite but not so_much that -PRON- have more_than a bite or two left
-PRON- call in -PRON- order all 3 time and -PRON- be ready in like 8_minute fresh and package really conveniently for a quick lunch in the car park of_course
the décor be really modern sleek and invite the patio look amazing and -PRON- would love to try sometime when -PRON- have more time
parking be ample in back there be a large parking_lot
and that be where -PRON- enter
delicious
small_portion expect from this kind_of restaurant
great service
decent drink
tastebud satisfy but not the belly
big rip_off on the planet
-PRON- big barbecue sandwiches be about 3 inch around and the menu say -PRON- be $ 5.75 but when -PRON- get home
-PRON- just see -PRON- charge -PRON- $_9 for a sandwich that be small than a junior cheeseburger from mcdonald_'s
-PRON- be basically a $_9 slider
-PRON- take a picture with a light next to -PRON- so -PRON- can get an idea of the size of this $_9 rip_off
a considerably quiet restaurant give that -PRON- have just open for business
the restaurant specialize_in rice_noodle soup but also offer side_dish as_well_as crawfish for dinner service
-PRON- order the rice_noodle in spicy sauce and a side of beef with soy_sauce
the side of beef be disappointing as -PRON- be bland and even the chill dipping_sauce could_not save -PRON-
the noodle_soup be on the other end of the spectrum
the soup be delicious just right on the level of spiciness and sourness
-PRON- come in a set of 3 a bowl for the broth a bowl of noodle and a tray consisting of side_dish and meat
at first -PRON- seem_like -PRON- be get a lot_of food
essentially -PRON- put everything -PRON- get into the bowl of soup which give -PRON- option of only put in the vegetable -PRON- want
in -PRON- opinion -PRON- think -PRON- should make the soup hot to allow the side_dish and noodle to cook better
note
-PRON- give free refill on the rice_noodle
-PRON- husband and -PRON- recently buy -PRON- first home and come to california closet to help -PRON- get organize

-PRON- be very_pleased_with -PRON- experience and will for sure recomend california closet and tamara
recently take several business partner to dinner here
the steak and corn muffin be -PRON- fav and the specialty drink be top_notch
-PRON- server pick_up that -PRON- be do business and act accordingly
-PRON- be a great experience
do_not_waste -PRON- money on this_place
there be much good option in montreal
the service be a_bit uptight and the food be mediocre for the value
do_not recommend -PRON-
-PRON- family and -PRON- have visit many zoo over the past_few_year while -PRON- be in the military
pittsburgh zoo be not the fresh zoo in the country
the entry fee be relatively low compare to san_diego zoo for_example but many really great zoo such_as st louis and chicago have no entry fee at all
-PRON- big complaint with the zoo be the child_'s play area
some of the play equipment be wear out or old but some of -PRON- be just plain dangerous

most of the zoo be fine but stay_away_from the kid slide the playground gear and anything that seem_like -PRON- may be a hazard
a small boy be kill at this zoo recently and -PRON- seem_like the zoo management have not learn anything about safety in the interim
if -PRON- be crowd with energetic big kid be especially careful if -PRON- have little one under 5
beyond that the entire park look_like -PRON- could use some landscaping and paint just to spruce the place up
-PRON- be pretty shocked to see the paver outside the jambo grille be all wavy and uneven a tripping hazard and -PRON- be just put in last_year obviously in a hurry by an incompetent builder
consider how many_people go to the pittsburgh zoo and the large amount_of entry fee be collect the facility really need to be upgrade and take_care_of good

-PRON- be tell last_week i would get the check first week of june and now -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- still in processing
and i get to wait and should be send to -PRON- in 3_4 week
this be bull shit and -PRON- should have receive right_away
if -PRON- insurance owe -PRON- money -PRON- send -PRON- a check within a week
this_place be slow as snail
why do -PRON- make -PRON- pay before insurance process -PRON- be beyond -PRON- and should be a scam
-PRON- have always be a fan_of french cooking so the twisted frenchman be high on -PRON- list to try
-PRON- be a small boutique restaurant and from the spartan modern decor the emphasis be on the food and wine
-PRON- offer a small menu selection than_most restaurant but everything offer appear to be excellent and invite
-PRON- indulge -PRON- with the steak tartare and the duck
both be awesome
the duck be a very_generous portion but -PRON- do_not get much steak tartare base_on the price -PRON- expect about twice the portion
-PRON- think -PRON- get maybe two tablespoon worth
the wine be very good
-PRON- have an alsace reisling
the dessert menu be a total disappointment though
frankly -PRON- think the chef either mail -PRON- in or the pastry chef quit the week before
-PRON- have the choice of vanilla custard or ice_cream
surely -PRON- be joke
despite this -PRON- be a 4 of 5_star place
the food be that good that -PRON- can overlook the small appetizer portion and the joke of a dessert menu
great specialty cocktail and even good food
the beet burger be phenomenal and the pimento_cheese dip appetizer be a great way to start the meal
go in with the hubby because -PRON- each receive an offer for a free cupcake
be tell -PRON- could_not use both offer even_though -PRON- be two separate people
-PRON- be buy more_than 2 cupcake so -PRON- be not_sure what the problem be
-PRON- suppose -PRON- feel that -PRON- be good to take -PRON- money once rather_than make -PRON- a repeat customer
minus one_star for crap service
the cupcake -PRON- be subpar
-PRON- have have amazing cupcake from place like georgetown cupcake and red_velvet but these be just okay
beautifully present but one be way_too buttery one be very dry and the other be not spectacular
in_fact -PRON- have have a stomach ache all night since sample
-PRON- have definitely make good at home
minus 2 start for bad cupcake
save -PRON- money time and stomach and go_somewhere_else
first big up to yelp and give -PRON- a 20 off food coupon on -PRON- phone after check in at hard_rock café
-PRON- be in a group_of 10 so that be big saving
show -PRON- to the waiter and -PRON- apply the discount no problemo
food
disappointing to say the least
pull_pork_sandwich be dry and the bbq_sauce be too_sweet and overpower
-PRON- also observe -PRON- other friend_who do_not finish -PRON- food not a good sign give that -PRON- be lunch
and -PRON- be hungry
drink have a large sized mojito which be suppose to have at_least 3 shot
taste_like there be no booze at all
-PRON- friend_who get the same drink absolutely concur
not happy
service combine with the 20 off yelp coupon
the service be the save grace point of -PRON- visit
-PRON- guy be spot on full of energy would sing along_with the track in the background and give -PRON- description of the dish
now if only the description could turn_into taste -PRON- would have be a good experience
-PRON- find the place to feel clean and the staff be very_welcoming and friendly
the food be average but ok
just nothing_special to write_home_about
fry be not over salt like some place do
one problem be that -PRON- order -PRON- burger well down and -PRON- friend order on medium_rare
both come_out well do
-PRON- be serve by the waitress and -PRON- be attentive
so be a man who be flitter around the place
-PRON- do a good job of keep the drink fill
placed be not loud but ceiling be not acoustic
so a loud table would more_than likely tend_to reflect noise all around
guess -PRON- get lucky that day
all in all seem_like a denny_'s with a different décor
yup -PRON- be review a gas_station
-PRON- like the quiktrip chain in_general and this station in particular
-PRON- find quiktrips to generally be the cheap gas in_town
sure the arco sign down the street may say -PRON- be 2 cents\/gallon cheap but then -PRON- get whack with the atm surcharge not to mention there be all those bum loitering in the adjacent bus stop
with quiktrip the place be well light there be always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump the convenience store be good_than most and unlike most other gas_station -PRON- do_not charge -PRON- for the air compressor
oh and the person at the register will actually greet -PRON- when -PRON- step inside the door while manage to sound sincere about -PRON-
be that the cool thing for a convenience store or what
bonus for those of -PRON- who enjoy shop at the hot chick safeway down the street this be the hot chick gas_station
family_own super_friendly people at the counter very clean place
but that be nothing compare to -PRON- ice_cream
-PRON- have cashew caramel generous_amount of nut banana with nilla wafers
add in as -PRON- scoop to stay crunchy
this ice_cream be bliss
-PRON- husband have lemon crunch creamy tart perfection with graham cracker bit java jolt strong coffee flavor with brownie bit chocolate_cover coffee bean
if -PRON- be anywhere near here go
-PRON- be worth the trip
-PRON- make a last_minute request to have initial embroider on the tongue of shoe for a present
-PRON- could_not be happy
-PRON- come_out so perfect
-PRON- will_definitely be return for upcoming thing -PRON- need do for bridal gift
the customer_service be top_notch and everything here exceed -PRON- expectation
-PRON- have drive_by many_time and have_no_idea -PRON- do embroidery until -PRON- look online
very happy customer
excellent service
michael be great even help push -PRON- car down parking deck to be tow
5_star all around these_guy be the best
the pharmacy be the bad i have ever experience
-PRON- seem to have a restriction or policy on everything that other pharmacy do_not
even other cvs pharmacy be good run then this one
-PRON- will_never step foot in that store again
ya well 2012 the same
kudo to some of the artist though very talented people there
do_not quite understand_why -PRON- have to pay to get in though
-PRON- would think -PRON- would free to expose the artist to more people
shrug
this_place have nothing that be great
the coconut shrimp appetizer be not good and the dipping_sauce do_not go with -PRON-
-PRON- have the cajun fry which be just ok and 1_lb shrimp with the everything sauce not very_flavorful
to top -PRON- off the service be horrible
order a pick_up order and time -PRON- distance to about_15_minute out
phone communication be normal no attitude and receive the order without trouble
person say -PRON- order would be ready in 15_minute so -PRON- seem perfect
once -PRON- arrive the staff be friendly but very stiff
offer the greeting then go on like a robot do -PRON- job
-PRON- do_not look busy inside at all
but -PRON- be move around not in a hurry
but as if -PRON- be behind on something
maybe -PRON- be -PRON- order
-PRON- do arrive exactly 15_minute later but still have to wait another 15_minute there by the front_door
not_sure if this be a young staff with poor leadership or just a new place where thing be not run smoothly yet
regardless be crave some wing and get the same old same old
wing be just average but
-PRON- be sure ill find the good wing in the area later
the main problem with this_place be that most of the girl now be fake
fake attitude fake tit
this may be a news flash but not every man desire a supermodel with massive gazongas
-PRON- much prefer the zanzibar but i still come to the rail sometimes if -PRON- be on -PRON- way
-PRON- be much good 20 or 25 yr ago when -PRON- have some more natural girl and many of -PRON- with whom -PRON- could have an interesting conversation
-PRON- be not like that today
amazing service and great price
-PRON- arrive on time and work hard while in -PRON- home
very cheerful owner and worker who do extra to get out some tough stain in the bedroom\/bathroom area
-PRON- whole house look so_much good
-PRON- get out all the stain -PRON- could_not with can carpet cleaner
-PRON- have two little one under four
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- to anyone look for speedy and fair carpet clean
-PRON- honey will probably kill -PRON- for post this review as out favorite spot could become compromise in some way by perhaps an influx of business prevent -PRON- from get -PRON- favorite booth right_away
but as a business owner i understand the importance of good word of mouth and i love_this_place
-PRON- be no foodie in_fact if -PRON- parent or close friend even catch wind of the fact_that -PRON- danielle deboe be write restaurant review -PRON- probably would just not believe -PRON- and maybe even fear for the business but that say
-PRON- be a mexican_restaurant family_own and operate and while i can_not speak to whether or not -PRON- the most authentic or more innovative or more anything than any_other mexican_restaurant i can say with the increase number_of mexican_restaurant pop_up around_town -PRON- still come_here once a week
(this or luchitas 's which be also a favorite
-PRON- margaritas may be glow in the dark green but -PRON- sure be tasty and the chicken fajita or enchilada the only_thing i ever order be delicious
if -PRON- be quiet enough -PRON- may even get special commentary by the staff on the spanish version dance with the star which be sure to be on during a visit
-PRON- favorite bridge downtown
-PRON- love -PRON-
the color the arch and the light at night just spectacular
-PRON- be not the long or the high but -PRON- love -PRON- and -PRON- be a gem
a couple of trip to vegas ago -PRON- eat dinner at cathouse before go out for the night
-PRON- goal be not a gourmet meal

as_far as korean food go -PRON- be authentic
however in pittsburgh do_not imagine that the korean restaurant be on_par w\/ place in other urban center
-PRON- be sort_of the place -PRON- go to when -PRON- be desperate to eat korean food
korea garden be actually pretty decently_price for korean food
there be a upstairs room if -PRON- come with a large_group
and -PRON- be very accommodate
parking can be a challenge though
really really really good
as a first_timer -PRON- find the set_up a little overwhelming\/confusing but then -PRON- put an asada taco in -PRON- mouth and everything be right in the world
so_much flavor
the avocado sauce be serious
the grill pepper on the side be necessary
spicy pork be super tasty
-PRON- wish -PRON- have chip

of_course -PRON- be angry when -PRON- arrive there at_11_a.m. yesterday because -PRON- send the fairly new car as a gift to -PRON- parent six year_ago only to feel_like now -PRON- be unsafe to drive
to think that -PRON- drive under those squeaky condition 24_hour away be upsetting

-PRON- go in one weekend with -PRON- boyfriend so -PRON- could get pedicure
-PRON- receive great customer_service even after -PRON- drop a nail polish and -PRON- break
there be nail polish all over -PRON- foot and all over the ground
-PRON- offer to clean -PRON- and -PRON- insist -PRON- sit
everything that be offer for the pedicure -PRON- choose be what -PRON- receive
as -PRON- leave the salon -PRON- mess_up one toe -PRON- go_back in and -PRON- fix -PRON- for -PRON- really quick
after get home and take a close look once -PRON- have dry -PRON- be extremely sloppy
the second coat be just slap on and do_not cover -PRON- whole nail
so -PRON- will no_longer go to that nail_salon just because one technician do_not_know_how to polish nail and -PRON- work at a nail_salon
-PRON- wish -PRON- know -PRON- name
but -PRON- do_not
cafe bink be a pleasant surprise for lunch on a saturday out on the patio with a view of the boulder across the road
-PRON- love binkleys and hesitate to go to the cafe think -PRON- may be disappoint
-PRON- be a_bit small and boxy on the inside but warm feeling and the patio be comfortable
the squash soup be brilliant also serve at binkleys
the frisee salad soup combo be pretty perfect
sandwich be good especially the salmon and applewood smoke bacon
-PRON- like the frite but the trio of accompany sauce be
well a_bit weird
sauce need more punch
skip the limpid green ice_tea and go for the black ice_tea or a nice glass of wine
nice presentation all around
great spot when -PRON- be up in this area
go to red robin for dinner the other night
-PRON- get the chili chili con queso as_an_appetizer
when -PRON- come_out -PRON- be surprised to see_how few chip be on the plate
most place give -PRON- a big basket of chip
$_7 worth
not so_much
-PRON- forget to say no salsa garnish on the queso
so -PRON- have to scoop off the tomato chunk
but the queso taste good and -PRON- even have some leave over to dip -PRON- fry in
-PRON- order the banzai burger no pink and no lettuce tomato or mayo
that be one of three burger -PRON- like to get
-PRON- other favorite be the whiskey river bbq burger and the royal red robin
-PRON- burger be cook right and taste good
-PRON- enjoy dip the fry in the leftover queso dip
-PRON- have to say -PRON- kind_of miss the day when -PRON- food come in a basket and the burger be partly wrap in paper
-PRON- be try to be fancy now with the rectangular plate and bottomless metal cylinder for the fry
-PRON- ask -PRON- server for some more napkin and -PRON- bring -PRON- two
-PRON- sure be stingy with napkin here
-PRON- do a pretty_good job keep -PRON- water refill
and while -PRON- do_not ask if -PRON- want more fry -PRON- friend request some and -PRON- bring -PRON- a basket
yay steak fry
red robin yummmm
-PRON- have eat at this cane 's too_many time to count
-PRON- be always busy so be prepare for a_little_bit of a wait
worth -PRON-

cane 's be a great substitute
-PRON- be fry_chicken
how could -PRON- not be delicious
cane sauce
food same as any_other location but the service here be terrible with long_wait time for food
kalani be the best bartender socially and liqourly

so -PRON- can play of -PRON- liking
great beverage and friendly service in a charming spot
what more can -PRON- ask for
-PRON- do_not try the baked treat try to be good but -PRON- look and smell amazing
-PRON- also would really like to buy some of -PRON- tea to try and take home
next_time
amazing food
authentic japanese izakaya feel
family run good service amazing food
be sure to ask what be the market price for some delicacy some be pricy but amazingly fresh and delicious
and -PRON- can take -PRON- own alcohol inside only without pay any fee for -PRON-
go to restaurant for date_night
stop here for the awful steeler game yesterday afternoon after -PRON- could_not get into the door at piper 's pub
-PRON- be really empty
of_course still a good draft list order a green flash west_coast ipa
on this visit -PRON- boyfriend
and -PRON- split an order of the poutine and a dozen tikka_masala wing
-PRON- have never have the wing there before but the sauce be off the chain and most of the wing be very meaty
the sauce be not_overly spicy either
the poutine be pretty_good the gravy be not as salty as the gravy at station street
service at the bar be efficient and friendly too
this be always a stellar spot to grab a quick_bite when in the south side
terrible service
please do all of the people_who be stick with this crappy company a favor and do_not even consider -PRON-
-PRON- be very undependable and unpleasant to talk to
-PRON- get switch over from security network and no one even say anything to -PRON- or send -PRON- any info
-PRON- have activate a new card so -PRON- auto pay would not work
and -PRON- be send a bill from security networks and send back a check and updated payment info as_soon_as -PRON- receive -PRON-
the excuse -PRON- give -PRON- for not receive this check for 4 week be because -PRON- account be switch over to monitronics last friday
so why have monotronics be call -PRON- husband every other day for the past 2_week and tell -PRON- -PRON- have a balance due
this_company be extremely unreliable and will make up any excuse and even argue_with -PRON- to keep -PRON- money
if -PRON- want out -PRON- have to pay_$ 1800
so -PRON- be stuck for 36 month over pay for a simple service
-PRON- wish -PRON- would have do more research as a first_time homeowner
but hopefully someone will read this and learn from -PRON- mistake
this_company do_not deserve a good reputation
so let -PRON- save other from get catch_up in this trap
love go into bombshell for shake or even to take one of the free fitness class -PRON- offer
eveyone be always so friendly no_matter_what time of day ton_of energy
-PRON- highly_suggest stop in for a meal replacement shake over 50 different flavor combination or take a free fitness class
needed antibiotics while on_vacation
call dr. logan and -PRON- be able_to diagnose and prescribe -PRON- with what -PRON- need in under 2_hour
call in the prescription to a walgreens across the street
and -PRON- have the antibiotic 30_minute later
all over the phone super quick super easy and at a very_reasonable_price
this review be a_bit overdue but -PRON- realize -PRON- should leave a review on how frustrating verizon make every process
-PRON- make the huge mistake of take -PRON- phone to the river
-PRON- have a galaxy s3 with a bluetooth speaker -PRON- buy online and which be waterproof unlike -PRON- phone
-PRON- put -PRON- phone in a couple ziploc bag which end_up be fruitless as the bag get water in -PRON- and -PRON- phone die
-PRON- put -PRON- in a bag of rice overnight but that do_not fix -PRON-
-PRON- pay for the damage protection plan
so -PRON- call this store since -PRON- be close and tell -PRON- -PRON- situation
-PRON- instruct -PRON- to come in so -PRON- could take a look
-PRON- arrive and per usual -PRON- be moderately busy
-PRON- put in -PRON- spot in line and wait about_15_minute which be not a huge deal
after wait one of the specialist come over and ask -PRON- for -PRON- name
once -PRON- confirm that -PRON- be who be wait -PRON- give -PRON- a card and tell -PRON- to call or go online with that
-PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- could do this in the store
-PRON- say no
-PRON- then ask why -PRON- be tell to come in -PRON- do_not_know either
waste of -PRON- time and the situation do_not feel_like -PRON- do_not even care because -PRON- be not buy anything from -PRON-
-PRON- wish there be a 5_star verizon store
this_place be amazing when -PRON- bring all -PRON- family here -PRON- always leave super happy and full
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend this for anyone that be look for ice_cream gelato fresh cookie and dessert have to make really good shake
the owner be really nice and treat as_well every_time -PRON- come in and employee be super_friendly and attentive
-PRON- usually do_not do review but -PRON- be so pleased -PRON- feel this need to be do
-PRON- be really skeptical on chos a company to come and check_out -PRON- a\/c unit without -PRON- husband be home
-PRON- do_not understand a thing when -PRON- come to stuff like this
but mike h make -PRON- feel at_ease -PRON- take -PRON- time to explain to -PRON- what -PRON- be -PRON- a\/c need and why
-PRON- seem to be very educate in -PRON- field of profession very good communication skill and hospitality go a looonnggg way with -PRON-
-PRON- a\/c be work the good -PRON- ever have
and -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be be scamm
mike h be cool just like -PRON- house be
emergency air thank -PRON- so_much
-PRON- have be back a_few time since -PRON- last review and -PRON- opinion be the same
-PRON- be average food with a local spin on denny_'s breakfast menu
someone compare -PRON- to the pork store in sf
and -PRON- would have to say that be a pretty close comparison
-PRON- also mention mama 's in sf
and -PRON- would have to say the egg and -PRON- be not as nice and not as tasty
one thing for sure -PRON- would choose hash house a go go in_vegas any day over this_place
stay_away_from this restaurant
-PRON- use too_much food color in -PRON- curry
food coloring be carcinogenic
save -PRON- health
if -PRON- could leave no star -PRON- would
-PRON- will not even answer -PRON- phone for takeout
-PRON- call three_time and be hang_up_on
keep up the good work edgewood
as a local -PRON- be highly disappointed in this_place
beautiful concept
but the service be horrible food be not good and not enough experienced people
this be -PRON- first and last_time
out of all -PRON- year visit vegas rio have always be a hotel of choice for -PRON- friendly dealer and front_desk_staff
this past experience -PRON- have with rio be heartbroken
-PRON- be sad to say the rio will no_longer be -PRON- hotel of choice
-PRON- arrive and check in around 6:30pm and housekeeping barely finish clean -PRON- room
one of the towel be not fold and hang correctly and so -PRON- get a little skeptic and start check the room
-PRON- open the mini bar and sure enough there be half emptied bottle and the bottle be not in place
-PRON- ask -PRON- boyfriend to take a picture of the bar and -PRON- call front_desk
-PRON- tell the female representative about the situation and ask -PRON- to make a note of what be go on
-PRON- ask if someone need to come up to the room to verify -PRON- do_not touch anything
and -PRON- say -PRON- be not necessary
and -PRON- will make a note of -PRON-
-PRON- make_sure when -PRON- check_out
-PRON- be only suppose to pay for the amount that be agree and sure enough
-PRON- say that be all -PRON- be show -PRON- need to pay
when -PRON- billing statement come -PRON- see an_additional transaction that triple -PRON- other transaction
of_course the first thing -PRON- do be call rio to see what be go on
-PRON- speak with a female representative name marie
and -PRON- say -PRON- be show
-PRON- be only suppose to be charge the amount that -PRON- recognize
-PRON- provide -PRON- with another phone_number to call but say -PRON- be not available until monday to help -PRON- out
-PRON- do_not_know_what be go on with management at the rio
-PRON- have be a loyal_customer for year and -PRON- family as_well
but this be not a very honest way to run a business especially such a big business
everyone be careful
update
apparently the rio charge -PRON- card because a different hotel guest share the same last name
come on rio
this restaurant be representative of many thing which draw -PRON- wife and -PRON- together while -PRON- be date
be that -PRON- both possess wine palate on the high_end of intermediate and that -PRON- both possess a love for fine din and edgier epicurean concept -PRON- naturally think the world of barrington 's
-PRON- be exactly_what -PRON- would expect from chef bruce moffett
a_bit_more intimate that one would think but this only add to the exclusivity of the establishment and thereby maintain the integrity of the dish
this also mean that -PRON- should make_reservation although walk_in 's be completely possible -PRON- would not stake -PRON- dinner on -PRON-
there be a limited menu which vary base_on the availability of the ingredient in a give period
there be also some credence give to ingredient be locally grow which be a huge trend in_charlotte
-PRON- wife and -PRON- both opt_for a 4-course experience and as_usual -PRON- be sure to deliberately differentiate -PRON- selection
this way -PRON- could sample most of the menu for -PRON- conceptual originality or tradionality as_well_as -PRON- overall quality and plating
everything be tremendous
by_far the good fine din cuisine in chartown
the wine_list be a nice compliment to the meal not too_many of the usual suspect but nothing too allocate
there be many_other choice to be have in_charlotte but mostly along the line of chain concept and none have the originality or the individual flare that moffett bring to the table

-PRON- come inside since -PRON- have learn that sit for 20_minute in a drive_thru line with only 2 car ahead of -PRON- do_not start -PRON- day off in the right way
there be 2 other folk stand around wait for -PRON- order to come_out when -PRON- arrive
once place -PRON- order -PRON- have to admit -PRON- be expect a wait perhaps even a_bit of a wait since there be folk wait

-PRON- do a great_job clean carpet and tile
-PRON- be glad -PRON- offer vegan_option although -PRON- wish -PRON- would state -PRON- on the regular menu instead_of make -PRON- ask for a special tiny menu
-PRON- be a_bit awkward
also awkward be get -PRON- own plate since -PRON- all have to be modify to be make vegan instead_of share with -PRON- friend
of_course -PRON- guess that be because of the restaurant style not this particular restaurant
obviously -PRON- would go to an all vegan small_plate place if -PRON- have the choice
anyways on to the food
-PRON- have the vegan version_of the hummus and pita black_bean slider and green_bean
-PRON- be way_too_much food even_though -PRON- suggest 3 plate per_person
but -PRON- be all very good
-PRON- especially like the flavor of the slider
the drink be good too and -PRON- server be great
all in all not worth the money but the food be good
-PRON- be move -PRON- stuff into a pod for 6_month while -PRON- new house be be build
this entail only need mover to move the heavy stuff down -PRON- stair and into -PRON- pod park in the driveway
most move company be quote -PRON- some ridiculous number for something that would only take 1 to 2_hour top
when -PRON- call here the quote be adjust lower because -PRON- would not be need mover for long
and -PRON- would not be need -PRON- to drive -PRON- stuff anywhere
the price be very fair

bad bad
-PRON- be there yesterday for a pre employment screening first of all when i get there the front_desk be empty and nobody care to ask what -PRON- need
-PRON- take a seat and 10min later someone_else come and go to the front_desk and -PRON- put -PRON- name on a list then i figure i need to put -PRON- name even_tho i put
i be there before -PRON- because -PRON- ask the hour on the paper
i be not take in until after -PRON-
like 40min after i arrive -PRON- be -PRON- time to go in and the not friendly lady ask -PRON- to put -PRON- purse on a box and -PRON- purse do_not fit -PRON- tell -PRON- i can_not leave -PRON- on the counter or outside unless someone take_care_of -PRON- for -PRON- so i have to walk to -PRON- car put -PRON- in and
when i get back
i wait for another moment after that the lady take -PRON- sample and -PRON- seem very bitter which be understanble up to one point because -PRON- must deal with a lot_of cranky drug user but anyways i do_not think be the way to do -PRON-
long history short
i wait like 1_hour bad customer_service ever not friendly never come_back
this be probably the best persian food -PRON- have have when -PRON- first encounter -PRON- about 5_year ago the koobideh be so amazing very juicy and full of life
now unfortunately -PRON- become a little dry but still excellent
the portion_size be great and the service be okay but more_than make up for -PRON- with the quality of the food
try a cup of tea after dinner
-PRON- will hit the spot
-PRON- go for lunch since -PRON- be walk distance from the office
-PRON- have be crave a italian sub
-PRON- be pretty_good

-PRON- recommend -PRON-
-PRON- be over visit from newport beach ca and read the review_on_yelp
there be a reason this restaurant be highly rat
the food be excellent and the hospitality offer by mustafa the owner of this_establishment be as if -PRON- have invite -PRON- to -PRON- home
this be a rarity to be serve what be basically home cook food in a sit_down casual restaurant
-PRON- have soup gyro and baba ghanoush all spectacular
this be truly a family_own restaurant where -PRON- be treat like family
can_not speak highly_enough about this experience
highly_recommend
-PRON- have be to many el pollo locos
this one be one of the good
-PRON- be clean and modern
the employee be friendly and fast
the food be fresh and taste great
awesome
-PRON- recommend_this_place

adam be great with -PRON-
-PRON- both love -PRON- and the traditional barbershop feel there be even a spinning pole outside
great atmosphere great haircut great price
hookahs where tasty
but -PRON- do_not get the smoke -PRON- want out of -PRON-
-PRON- be hit real light
and -PRON- keep flag_down the staff to fix -PRON- the customer_service be awesome but the price and quality of the item be a_bit iffy
-PRON- hate to do this because this_place be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- friend and -PRON- who have not go there in a few_month decide to go since -PRON- want some good french_toast
-PRON- get there seat -PRON- per usual
this guy come to -PRON- table can_not speak a word of english and be try to take -PRON- drink order
-PRON- repeat -PRON- wrong like twice and -PRON- just look_at each_other
-PRON- say to hold on then a girl come -PRON- can speak_english but not very well
-PRON- be really nice and try -PRON- good
-PRON- get water and -PRON- friend get an_iced coffee
-PRON- bring the drink and -PRON- friend coffee have a giant spoon in -PRON-
-PRON- be coffee not a milk shake
-PRON- order -PRON- food
-PRON- get the french_toast special and order -PRON- egg basted
-PRON- come_out with -PRON- food and -PRON- egg be so runny and undercook -PRON- be disgusting
-PRON- show the server
and -PRON- say okay let -PRON- have -PRON- make -PRON- new one
-PRON- come_out later put the new plate of egg on the table
and -PRON- kid -PRON-
not the egg be so over cook -PRON- look_like a hard boil egg
like be that suppose to be a screw -PRON- from the chef
-PRON- be so tired of complain
-PRON- just do_not even say anything and take -PRON- like that
-PRON- will not go_back anytime_soon
sweet spot
no -PRON- be not
c'mon -PRON- be pink
-PRON- be get ice_cream inside
-PRON- be retro
everything here scream this_place be tubular hip rad cool tight phat
so what s the deal
first_off -PRON- be under the impression -PRON- have homemade ice_cream
-PRON- do_not
-PRON- be dreyer
with can whipped topping canned cherry can sauce
nothing here be unique
aha besides the decor
-PRON- blow through 1500 calorie + for garbage
-PRON- be very dissapointed
so let -PRON- get on to the dish -PRON- have
-PRON- eat half of the top hat
describe as a creampuff stuff with rich vanilla ice_cream and cover with hot_chocolate
sound good do_not -PRON-
the cream puff shell which should be light and fluffy with a slight pull be extremely tough flavorless dry and -PRON- be assume old
how can -PRON- even call -PRON- a cream puff when the good part the cream be non_existent
so -PRON- dry ball be fill with dreyer ice_cream
not good
-PRON- actually eat lunch first
-PRON- have an american menu
egg salad blt burgers tuna grilled cheese etc
the problem be nothing be good
-PRON- order a patty melt
the burger be tasteless and very very small
-PRON- would say about the size patty -PRON- would find on a mcdonalds kids cheeseburger
the kicker
no fry
no fries
what the fuck
chips?stick these chip in some ice_cream and get creative
daughter have a blt two strip yes two strip of bacon on wonder bread
coleslaw be the bad
-PRON- have ever had
this_place just suck
huge upset for a place -PRON- be really look_forward_to
-PRON- try to review the food as much as_possible but -PRON- have to say this about the service
ssllooww
-PRON- have a group_of 8 and -PRON- waitress could only bring_out 2 drink at a time
4 damn trip to just get -PRON- drink
-PRON- charge for refill too
-PRON- guess that be how -PRON- keep that nostalgic feel because restaurant have not be charge refill since the day of the flood
ann be extremely professional and welcoming
-PRON- be able_to get -PRON- in for a consult and subsequent appointment immediately and be extremely flexible to accommodate -PRON- schedule and work hour
-PRON- office be immaculate extremely clean and also comfortable and private
ann put -PRON- at_ease right_away and do an exceptional job with hair_removal
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- to anyone look for a permanent and safe hair_removal system
-PRON- think this may be the good overall buffet -PRON- have ever be to
yes that be a bold statement
-PRON- have a huge variety_of all the food -PRON- love to eat
seafood be plentiful and fresh(-ish
-PRON- have really interesting food station compare to other buffet
instead_of a generic asian section -PRON- have separate sushi vs dim_sum section and a make -PRON- own raman section
-PRON- have the typical meat station with rotisserie chicken and prime_rib and on_top_of that -PRON- have a really aggressive street taco guy
-PRON- try really hard to get -PRON- to take 3 taco but -PRON- look -PRON- in the eye and -PRON- finally give -PRON- one
here be a weird thing_about the bread
the bread display look suspiciously like the bread display at guy savoy
could -PRON- have the same baker
-PRON- hope not
the only_thing -PRON- be truly disappointed in be the dessert bar
nothing be particularly good and nothing set -PRON- apart from other dessert bar
some of the pastry be mediocre
-PRON- have scoop serve gelato which be a step above an ice_cream machine -PRON- guess
the only thing(s horrible about the buffet be the wait
-PRON- call bs on the pager system
like other restaurant -PRON- be a pager to tell -PRON- when to get in line
so -PRON- still end_up wait_forever and a day for -PRON-
this be an_amazing company that will make home buy a breeze
-PRON- be a first_time home buyer and -PRON- have set the bar very high
-PRON- would_highly_recommend use -PRON- service
-PRON- husband and -PRON- always pass brio and talk_about go there one day for dinner
tonight -PRON- finally have dinner here and -PRON- be happy with everything
customer_service and the food be awesome the atmosphere be a plus
-PRON- will will most definitely be back
last_night be -PRON- third sampling of soul sushi and every_time -PRON- have be 5_star
after year of try to find good well price sushi in edinburgh -PRON- be so happy to have find this_place
-PRON- be a delivery only company but that mean -PRON- can have amazing sushi deliver straight to -PRON- door
-PRON- menu offer several platter box and roll as_well_as sashimi
-PRON- go for the land and sea platter most of the time
this be a 36 piece platter feature a variety_of fish and vegetable roll and nigiri
the platter change daily to what be fresh and what the chef want to prepare
the food arrive beautifully present and be always freshly make
last_night the four of -PRON- share 2 platter and a tuna box all for £ 16 each
-PRON- would be at_least double that in a restaurant
-PRON- be devour in minute and -PRON- slump into a sushi induce coma content and happy
go people
eat sushi
cheers amy
-PRON- have to return and pick_up a bag from mccarran airport in the middle_of -PRON- short vegas vacation
the first yellow cab driver be nice not too overly friendly or chatty
the fare from linq hotel to the airport cost -PRON- $ 16.75
$_20 take_care_of the fare and tip
return to the same hotel from the airport cost -PRON- almost $_30
solomon tesfagaber take -PRON- the long and slow way to hustle more money out of -PRON-
-PRON- be the overly friendly and chatty driver who ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to take the freeway or no freeway
when -PRON- husband respond -PRON- be the driver
the fast way
what other reason this guy solomon have other_than hustle -PRON- by ask a couple of tourist which way for already a short 7 minute ride to hotel from the airport
-PRON- husband be vey vocal about this ride soon_as -PRON- take -PRON- to tunnel and freeway -PRON- ex cabbie husband know_what -PRON- be up to and make this ride very uncomfortable for the driver
-PRON- serve up a great slice of pizza
during -PRON- last_visit to pittsburgh
-PRON- eat there three day in a row one of those day -PRON- eat there twice
-PRON- will_never need to order extra cheese -PRON- do_not even know if -PRON- can because the cheese be just right
-PRON- will come off the pizza if -PRON- do_not take a bite like a man so be warn
also -PRON- be hot out of the oven so those with dainty mouth need to give -PRON- a second
-PRON- would_recommend get a canoli from next_door while -PRON- wait because -PRON- be legit
-PRON- bf and -PRON- go for an_early dinner after -PRON- friend recommend_this_place
-PRON- be able_to enjoy the nice outdoor_patio since -PRON- be a sunny afternoon
-PRON- both get flight with 1 3 9 12 15 18 36 38 see attach photo
1 be easily -PRON- favorite
the fish and chip be mediocre this_place be good for beer than for food
the waitstaff be not the friendly but -PRON- be a crowded afternoon
so -PRON- be probably stress
huge beer_selection
-PRON- be fill so bad to be the first one to make a first rew with one_star
the girl work in the cashier come to my with very bad attitude.so
-PRON- buy 5 meal for -PRON- friend and 3 drink and 2 cup for water.i want to taste a drink and -PRON- use the water cup instead_of the drink cup.she leave the custemer and -PRON- come to -PRON- rite away to tell -PRON- that that be not water in the cup.so

-PRON- do -PRON- wedding ceremony here 3_week ago
after do ton_of research -PRON- become clear that this be by_far the most beautiful place in the gta to have an outdoor ceremony
the gazebo lake waterfall and vegetation create an almost fairy tale like setting
the photo do_not do justice -PRON- have to see -PRON- for -PRON-
have say that -PRON- be somewhat disappointed by the organization in this_place
in this summer -PRON- do ton_of ceremony on the weekend all back to back and -PRON- really do feel_like -PRON- be just another product on the conveyor belt
when -PRON- guest arrive there be no clear sign where to go maybe because there be so_many of -PRON- and there be nobody on premise from the staff who -PRON- could ask for help
there be many_other people on the ground which create unneeded friction and there be a lot_of pressure on -PRON- to wrap up the ceremony and vacate the gazebo promptly for the decorator from the next ceremony to step in
overall absolutely gorgeous place but scheduling and mgmt need work
the sushi here be amazing
-PRON- have never find a good sushi restaurant in_phoenix up until now
-PRON- decide to order a_few different specialty roll and each one be fresh tasty and yummy especially the oh_my god roll
what be in -PRON- -PRON- ask
order -PRON- and find out
-PRON- will_definitely say oh_my god
find out why -PRON- name -PRON- that
now one major weakness
-PRON- see that -PRON- have beef bulgogi on -PRON- menu
-PRON- get excited that -PRON- have this
usually bulgogi be a korean dish but -PRON- be hungry and decide to order -PRON- as_well
word of advice
do_not
-PRON- be really really chewy and rubbery for -PRON-
stick to the sushi
and -PRON- can_not go_wrong
this walmart be soo bad and -PRON- allway smell the employe be not so good either but -PRON- a wallmart in the getto so ill give -PRON- 3_star
ok
-PRON- have read a number_of the review and the first thing to say be why would -PRON- go to a buffet and then be disappoint -PRON- be a buffet
-PRON- mean
.duh
oh so -PRON- friends\/family\/someone else 's fault drag -PRON- here
so what
-PRON- be a buffet
-PRON- have a choice -PRON- could have say no
the first_time -PRON- go into a modern style buffet be not a hometown but same concept
-PRON- know that -PRON- have be conceive by a military mess nco
this be mess hall food
food cook en masse for a lot_of hungry people at the same time
when -PRON- cook egg by the case -PRON- do_not get that personal chef touch so -PRON- can_not expect that cook for -PRON- taste
and so -PRON- go for the rest_of the food
the bottom_line if -PRON- want a nice quiet setting with food cook to -PRON- order then don't go to a buffet any buffet
as buffet go this be the good at which -PRON- have eat
the quality of the food and cooking be good by_far than hometown or any_other in so cal
the selection be good and wider and -PRON- actually can get steak cook basically to order
all -PRON- can eat steak for $_14
-PRON- be not claim jumper or outback but then -PRON- be not $_35 either
the cleanliness be about what -PRON- would expect for a place that be constantly fill to capacity most of the day
so_far each_time -PRON- have be the seat and table be wipe off and clean and the plate cup and utensil have all be clean
the negative well the only problem -PRON- have
and -PRON- be the sole reason for four_star instead_of five be that although -PRON- make regular announcement over the speaker that child must have an_adult with -PRON- at all time -PRON- do_not station employee to monitor the counter to enforce that rule on all the people_who do_not monitor -PRON- kid
so small child be often get -PRON- own food and demonstrate exactly why -PRON- should not be
-PRON- even have a small problem yesterday afternoon
-PRON- be a minor issue but the manager hand -PRON- -PRON- business card with a coupon for a free dinner on -PRON- next_visit
-PRON- recommendation if -PRON- be look for a nice sit_down restaurant go_somewhere_else but if -PRON- want an all -PRON- can eat buffet this be the good
-PRON- husband be look for milanesas
so -PRON- come to this_place since -PRON- be the only place in scottsdale that -PRON- could find that have any on -PRON- menu
-PRON- husband order milanesas with rice and bean
-PRON- order a burrito and taco combo with carnita
the milanesas be not cook to order
-PRON- be dry and brittle look
the meat be paper thin
the bean be like taco_bell bean -PRON- be of a watery substance
-PRON- carnita be boil and tasteless
-PRON- burrito have nothing but carnita in -PRON-
who do that?!!they serve -PRON- combo meal with a side of lettuce and tomato with a dollop of mayonnaise
pretty strange if -PRON- ask -PRON-
the only_thing -PRON- enjoy be the horchata
thaaaat be about -PRON-
after go to a_few place in scottsdale look for authentic_mexican_food -PRON- have officially give up
the only_reason -PRON- give two_star be because the horchata be really good
other_than_that the place be a hole_in the wall full of fly
food
8\/10 value 6\/10
service 7\/10
ambiance\/décor
7\/10 $_15 for a piece_of fry_chicken and a drink be not worth -PRON- in -PRON- opinion
first of all -PRON- can only order chicken and drink
do_not be confuse by -PRON- menu
some item say come soon some do_not but -PRON- still can_not order any food item other_than the chicken
-PRON- do_not_know_what the timeline for the other thing be
seaweed be a green powder
-PRON- taste_like seaweed and be nice in_addition to the salt and pepper s&p
-PRON- try a_bit of -PRON- friend 's regular s&p and -PRON- be a little salty just on -PRON- own
there be a_few seasoning option but -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be obviously enough display
-PRON- be like fine print under the chicken
-PRON- only remember s&p seaweed and maybe spicy although -PRON- be not_sure about that last one
-PRON- be also unclear if -PRON- can have multiple because -PRON- ask for seaweed think -PRON- could only pick one but -PRON- receipt say s&p and seaweed
maybe s&p be the default
chicken be hot and taste pretty_good but -PRON- mean -PRON- be just a giant piece_of fry_chicken
-PRON- be full with the chicken and drink
full but not stuff
drinks what be yogurt
-PRON- feel_like this be a question a lot_of place need to answer
-PRON- have the green apple yogurt drink as part of the $_15 combo and -PRON- taste great
-PRON- love sour green apple
but -PRON- do_not_know_what part of this be yogurt
like a drop of yogurt
-PRON- be essentially a juice
but -PRON- taste great though albeit expensive
beat the lunch rush by 10_minute
there be not a line at 11:50am so -PRON- get to order immediately and while -PRON- eat in people start to trickle in but -PRON- do_not get unreasonably busy
the wait be mostly for the food preparation which be under 10_minute
-PRON- may come_back to try some of -PRON- other fry thing but as is the chicken or even the chicken and drink combo seem really expensive
great work scott
very satisfied with -PRON- work
scott be very_professional and considerate towards the customer need and concern
not to mention the ease of scheduling and flexibility of re scheduling
highly_recommend -PRON-
pride weekend beautiful weather evening pack patio
seat wait 25 minute for a person to acknowledge -PRON- be there while all along people be be serve even people_who come in after -PRON-
-PRON- be patient people however -PRON- be run thin real thin
finally a guy come apologize and take -PRON- drink order finally
at this point -PRON- be check_out
-PRON- stay with water but -PRON- partner order a drink
-PRON- be pay for by the server nice
food finally order appetizer be out of this_world amazing as_usual
order another drink not -PRON- -PRON- be forget about for a_bit again
and come_out wrong stuff happen
-PRON- seem as though -PRON- place be not staff with either enough people or people that really be all over the place
-PRON- be not the only couple party that be complain amongst -PRON-
-PRON- will go_back as -PRON- frequent here but the service need help
-PRON- over cook the halibut in the special
four people in -PRON- party that have -PRON- spend 2 day with gi problem
the guacamole be more like a salad than a dip
big chunk with no creamy goodness
the only redeeming quality be the waiter be very_nice
will not go_back
just have the bad_experience with cab 6452
not only be the air conditioning not work in the cab which -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- be suppose to have available upon request but when -PRON- stepmother ask for -PRON- change back the driver try to keep $_4 tip for -PRON-
keep in mind -PRON- go from the forum shop to aria without_any suitcase etc
-PRON- be all about tip when merit but this be definitely not the case
then when -PRON- stepmother press -PRON- to give -PRON- back -PRON- money -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be in america and that -PRON- should speak_english which -PRON- be albeit with an accent
-PRON- find this xenophobic comment quite ironic come from -PRON- consider -PRON- be clearly an immigrant -PRON-
once -PRON- finally get -PRON- change -PRON- top -PRON- off by flip -PRON- both off
thank -PRON- vegas western for give -PRON- more reason to stick with uber
the liquid room be a decent venue for watch a band but -PRON- would not be -PRON- first choice as a bar to continue drink in after the pub close
partly this be because -PRON- do_not consistently have every beer\/cider or draught -PRON- preference and to often -PRON- need to fall back to a bottle
this be not that unusual for a live venue but -PRON- be pretty poor for a bar\/club -PRON- also be not that cheap
back on the plus side the sound_system be decent and -PRON- have enjoy the gig -PRON- have see here but -PRON- feel_like make do simply because edinburgh be so lacking in decent sized venue
in short -PRON- would avoid the club night but be happy to go to a gig so liquid room 's get a very middle_of the road
a
ok from -PRON-
-PRON- and jessie b be early for -PRON- evening shenanigan
blush
so -PRON- stop_by parasol down for a drink
well the drink all sound amazing
-PRON- be hard to decide
but -PRON- do
and -PRON- also order a couple of shot
not only do -PRON- sound amazing
-PRON- be perfect
such a great spot to chill out and do some people_watch
saturday_night invegas
-PRON- be glad -PRON- stop_by
-PRON- be worth -PRON-
food be decent but a_bit on the pricey side
buy a pork_chop with rice for $ 10.50 what -PRON- get be mostly rice with a_bit of pork_chop on rice
not_sure -PRON- would go here again for this reason alone for this price one be good off at congee queen
-PRON- find a groupon for a month of unlimited spinning for studio 360 and so_far -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- do_not_know_how much -PRON- would like
the drop saddle stand most of the time style
but -PRON- work
even_though -PRON- will be awhile before -PRON- can even begin to keep up with the instructor who be great and sort_of have to go at -PRON- own_pace each_time -PRON- wind up completely drench in sweat by the end and -PRON- fitness tracker say -PRON- would burn 500 600 calorie in an_hour
great workout
if -PRON- can do -PRON- anyone can do -PRON-
good chicken_wing in downtown madison
really
to be honest -PRON- never actually think about -PRON-
prior to the arrival of this small time chain to downtown madison all -PRON- have by way of decent wing be buffalo wild wings
and -PRON- would not even think of set foot in that place ever again because decent be a huge overstatement
-PRON- be get a lot more_than that at quaker steak lube
the boneless chicken_wing for_example set a standard for chicken_wing that -PRON- have never taste before
the outside be fry to a perfect crispy texture that manage to avoid fall_into that trap of be chewy and fatty while still transcend -PRON- traditional fried_chicken coating
there be a variety_of interesting sauce to try at this_place and since -PRON- can mix any number_of -PRON- at no additional charge there be no way -PRON- could run out of thing to try
-PRON- decide to venture 6 wing with a combination of -PRON- spicy arizona ranch sauce and -PRON- less spicy pineapple rum sauce
the combination result in something that smell and taste 10 time good_than -PRON- could have ever possibly expect
however the spiciness be pitifully weak
with arizona ranch be rank as have the high scoville rating of -PRON- medium range sauce -PRON- can_not help but wonder just how spicy -PRON- can make a wing
in -PRON- defense -PRON- do_not_care to try the atomic sauce lest -PRON- taste_like melt penny -PRON- be look_at -PRON- blazin sauce but -PRON- still want a burn if -PRON- be get the next high thing
-PRON- get some onion_ring on the side as_well and while -PRON- be not expect much these be the good onion_ring -PRON- have have in a long long_time
normally -PRON- receive floppy onion_ring that automatically sort and separate -PRON- into chewy onion and broken brittle bread the second -PRON- take a bite
but these onion_ring manage to retain -PRON- texture and taste damn good in the process
onion and all -PRON- give a nice crunch
quaker steak lube 's onion_ring be essentially the onion version_of good steak cut french_fry
-PRON- do take issue with the price here
all that and a cheap domestic beer cost -PRON- around 15 buck after tax and tip
for a small batch of boneless wing -PRON- be pay over a dollar a wing
and -PRON- can_not just buy wing in bulk since -PRON- will not let -PRON- pick more_than one sauce\/mix for a large amount
in this respect quaker steak lube be perform just as poorly as b dub 's
but at_least at this_place -PRON- can at_least feel slightly more justified in pay exorbitant amount_of money for delicious fry_chicken
be want to try this_place for a while yet whenever -PRON- would come to this area -PRON- be because -PRON- be crave taco at taco y taco
after_read shirley b 's review -PRON- know -PRON- have to make time to try -PRON-
-PRON- go in around 5:30 and -PRON- be the only one in there do_not surprise -PRON- though as -PRON- seem more like a breakfast and lunch spot
cute decor friendly waitress however -PRON- feel really humid inside probably due_to the kitchen be right in the middle_of the restaurant
-PRON- wish -PRON- would turn up the music though -PRON- be kind_of awkward hear the waitress talk to the chef \/owner about make a mess of the toaster close to closing
when -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- know -PRON- be because -PRON- order sandwich
we'd definitely_come_back during_lunch probably not towards the time -PRON- first go so -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be bother -PRON-
the food be great

so could_not understand_why -PRON- where still sooo slow with service
food be cold
appetizer come_out with out with -PRON- meal so -PRON- husband no_longer even want -PRON-
very good burger on this visit
the los angeles delicate spinach mozzarella bacon avocado spread and garlic aioli
the aioli be fresh with mince garlic clearly visible
a very juicy burger as the puddle be -PRON- burger be place would indicate
definitely_worth a stop
-PRON- coworker show this_place while -PRON- be in_town

so fast enjoy the meaty piece_of chicken tasty gravy and the spice be perfect
great for take out
this show be amazing
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- decide to do -PRON- valentine_'s celebration a couple day early to beat the crowd and could_not decide between zumanity and zarkana
-PRON- end_up choose zumanity due_to review and -PRON- do_not regret -PRON-
yes -PRON- be raunchy
yes -PRON- be sensual
yes -PRON- be sexual
so those easily offended or closed minded need not to attend
there be currently a buy one get the second ticket $_10 deal
-PRON- purchase the low orchestra section which be right behind the love seat
as_usual -PRON- be run_late but -PRON- luck out because as -PRON- be get seat one of the employee offer -PRON- one of the front row love seat
awesome
to be honest though any seat be decent because the theater be small
the performance overall be great
there be a mixture_of comedy audience participation singing and acrobatic
-PRON- can_not wait to see -PRON- again
this be a great park that stretch a long way up the humber river
the southern end be especially popular for picnic and barbeque and in the summer there be usually an ice_cream truck hang_out in the parking_lot
be warn that there be not too_many entrance and exit along the length of the park so unless -PRON- be go a fair way be prepared to turn_around and come_out the way -PRON- come
-PRON- be also a_bit dangerous by the river in storm or after thaw since most of the park be a flood plain -PRON- remember one winter when -PRON- become almost impassable after huge slab of ice wash up everywhere
the people at this_place be soooo funky cool
-PRON- have want to go here for a while
-PRON- love that -PRON- be in a hostel too and -PRON- be not disappoint
-PRON- do_not_know_what typical persian food be but -PRON- small menu have a lot_of great option if -PRON- like try new thing
-PRON- go at an odd time of day but -PRON- do_not think -PRON- get crazy busy
the price be reasonable -PRON- be very lay_back and -PRON- can_not wait to go again
the food be below_average very bland
-PRON- be at bertram for a conference for a week
so -PRON- have opportunity to try -PRON- entire lunch menu
not one thing would -PRON- consider very good
-PRON- have come once before for buy one get one sushi and that be decent
however -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- come and get a bento_box and again -PRON- be very boring
the main_reason for give -PRON- a below_average rating be because of the service
-PRON- be so so very slow
not just the speed to which thing come_out but even get a glass of water
-PRON- also notice after -PRON- get -PRON- food during -PRON- most_recent visit that all the other table get free bread except for -PRON-
jipp
-PRON- take too_long to come_back for -PRON- to complain_about -PRON- so -PRON- just go without
this_place be kind_of weird to -PRON-
there be nothing inherently bad about this_place just odd
-PRON- have only be once
and -PRON- do_not have that good of a time
-PRON- be a saturday_night and town square be absolutely pack like the busy -PRON- have ever see and this_place be just about dead which be super odd
-PRON- walk_in and go to the bar 7 of -PRON- and even_though -PRON- be not busy -PRON- still take about 20_minute for -PRON- to get out drink even_though there be two bartender
the manager or who -PRON- assume to be the manager keep walk_around and hang_out with each_other but never really check on people and be mainly concern with adjust -PRON- vest and hat
-PRON- do seem_like nice people though
the light scheme be odd the music be not the good and -PRON- drink menu be very_limited
-PRON- be on a bar crawl and the excitement and fun seem to slow to a crawl when -PRON- get here
half the people leave to go to another place
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- will be come_back here
-PRON- know chipotle get knock by people but -PRON- like -PRON- generally
the food be average fill and -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
at_this_location the service be impersonal and over rush but_hey do -PRON- expect more_than that
3_star
-PRON- have only have coffee and tea there which be good
-PRON- be just a little too small but the main thing that -PRON- do_not like be that half the place have high table and chair which be not that comfortable and everyone grab the other table first
dr. cravatta and -PRON- staff be very_professional efficient and knowledgeable
-PRON- immediately feel trust and comfort after -PRON- first consultation
-PRON- have to have a dental implant do here and -PRON- make -PRON- as painless of an experience as_possible which be say a lot
thank -PRON-
the atmosphere be relaxed the chicken parm be slowly cook_perfectly
-PRON- will be back
the 3_star be strictly for the laura the bartender and the daytime atmosphere not the food
-PRON- have be to nakama a handful of time though only once be -PRON- specifically for food
the rest_of the time -PRON- be for a_few drink or some sake because -PRON- be a nice day out
and -PRON- like sit near -PRON- window
-PRON- have never order a specialty drink only beer and sake
tip
if -PRON- go and like sake get the crazy milk and check_out the bottle for a_few lulz
-PRON- have order food twice -PRON- believe one time be reference above when -PRON- be a full meal and the order be just some sushi for tapas style appetizer
neither time have the food impress -PRON-
in_fact -PRON- be probably the bad sushi -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- boyfriend order a spicy_tuna_roll and the tuna look_like baby food as if someone have chew -PRON- up and spit -PRON- back out no lie
-PRON- be disgusting but -PRON- power through most of -PRON- as -PRON- be starve
-PRON- also manage to mess_up fry_rice completely annihilate the veggie for some_reason
the sushi_roll -PRON- have order have range_from eh to gross
-PRON- can_not give this_place less_than 3_star though because every_time -PRON- have go -PRON- have have a really great time
-PRON- guess -PRON- would break_down -PRON- review like this food 1_star atmosphere 4_star service 4_star
when -PRON- girlfriend move in around august of last_year the place be great
the staff be one of the nice and good -PRON- have meet

-PRON- end_up have to pay -PRON- again
be also tell by jimmy that if -PRON- would not have misplace -PRON- receipt -PRON- could have be fix
pretty crappy -PRON- blame -PRON- on -PRON- instantly and make no effort to fix in
another time -PRON- have to pay -PRON- rent late and jimmy tell -PRON- an amount $_100 high_than what -PRON- actually owe
have -PRON- not bring -PRON- up to -PRON- and -PRON- do the math to catch -PRON- lie -PRON- would have take the extra $_100
also the property be more worried about new move in and -PRON- renovation then -PRON- current resident
the only be -PRON- would stay be if the original staff return
well if sherri be promote and jimmy be fire -PRON- would think about -PRON-
if -PRON- go here and talk to jimmy\/jame
ask for a sherri and -PRON- will not feel_like -PRON- at a use car lot

the be obviously former stripper and do_not fit well at all as -PRON- could_not dance and be lumber across the stage
there be no key theme to the show
after watch the woman tear through t_shirt the second_time and stumble across the stage while try to carry off the dismal choreography for 10_minute -PRON- be ready to leave
-PRON- be not_sure how long the show run be
but the show be now closed
maybe with some more time and fine tuning -PRON- would have be a_bit_more watchable but -PRON- doubt -PRON-
a_few of the woman be cute but even the man -PRON- be with be bored
-PRON- have see one fake boob or small boob
and -PRON- have see -PRON- all
this show be less_than impressive
terrible customer_service

if -PRON- go to get the hotdog spend the little extra to get the premium\/jumbo dog
-PRON- the same bun and fixing but the meat quality be like the difference_between nathan 's and a highschool cafetera
in -PRON- opinion -PRON- should stop offer the standard quality hot_dog and just go all out on the jumbo
-PRON- be not do -PRON- any justice by try to pass off that crappy tube of animal product as food
for some_reason the two dog be just that different

can_not find any high_quality seafood restaurant better_than this
everything be perfect but of special note be the crusted sand dab
-PRON- serve nice bread with the dinner as_well
nice atmosphere and good service
no need to go to scottsdale for great restaurant anymore
first_time here at_this_location here in_las_vegas
place be clean and food be sub_par good
-PRON- server be responsive and provide -PRON- family with everything -PRON- need
not too_many filipino restraunt around but this_place be the good one amongst the rest
lovely theatre super pretty in an ancient way
hasher will show -PRON- to -PRON- seat there be many toilet and bar inside
feel a_bit like a maze but not in a bad way
-PRON- watch legally blond there and -PRON- be nice
sat downstairs which be ok
but -PRON- would not recommend sit too_far away on the ground floor
-PRON- good seat in the upper circle as seat in the back of the low circle -PRON- get a good view of the stage but totally miss out the pretty theatre
-PRON- find -PRON- easy to reach but super hard to find an open café after 17 or 18 around so do_not count on a nice cup of coffee before a show
if -PRON- be in_toronto this be worth the drive
quote be almost half the price of what -PRON- be get here
-PRON- get -PRON- passenger side window replace on -PRON- mustang
drop -PRON- in the morning and pick -PRON- up the next_day
-PRON- also have a chip in the windshield which be bill directly to insurance with no deductible or increase
farah be very_professional and respond quickly to -PRON- question via email
quote be send to -PRON- within the hour of request and stay true once work be complete
-PRON- be so difficult to trust service centre these day
and -PRON- be happy -PRON- find this small business
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_location to all -PRON- friend and family
work near life be sweet -PRON- frequently stop in for lunch or to grab some sweet for the office
everything -PRON- have have be so good
the sweet be more_than tempting
there be cupcake and cookie and scone and croissant and cake
and -PRON- name -PRON-
all fabulous
-PRON- also have a_few lunch option about three sandwich and a daily soup
-PRON- have have the chicken noodle lentil chili and tomato with chicken and orzo
and -PRON- be all delicious especially the tomato with chicken and orzo
-PRON- sandwich be make with freshly carve turkey ham or roast beef on homemade ciabatta
-PRON- be a great neighborhood spot and the owner be lovely
-PRON- be always at the cafe and super_friendly
definitely check -PRON- out if -PRON- be in the neighborhood
-PRON- be be quite a while since -PRON- have have decent thai food so -PRON- go into this thinking -PRON- would be pretty sub_par
maybe lower expectation be the key but -PRON- be really happy with -PRON-
-PRON- be relatively cheap and -PRON- have a pretty_decent lunch_special from 11 3
-PRON- order the red_curry at a medium spice_level
-PRON- typically eat very spicy food but be -PRON- first_time there -PRON- figure -PRON- would be safe to start medium to gauge -PRON-
-PRON- be the perfect_amount
-PRON- have a good kick without take_away_from the flavor and -PRON- be have to ration out -PRON- water intake towards the end
so even if -PRON- do like spicy food be warn that medium be quite hot
-PRON- entree do come_out at separate time which -PRON- imagine can be slightly awkward especially in large_group but all in all the food be good the service be quick and the bill be pretty low
-PRON- beer and food be good
downside
-PRON- get loud
after only be at stamper a_few time for a late_night drink -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try for dinner
the beer menu at stampers be great lot_of good quality choice
-PRON- be especially happy to see a nice assortment_of true belgium beer
for an_appetizer -PRON- decide to try a_few different cheese
-PRON- be all very good and be serve with olive and some very fresh tomato
for -PRON- entree -PRON- both have the short_rib with garlic mash_potato and brussel_sprout
the short_rib -PRON- be amazing very tender and flavorful
the mash_potato be also very good
the brussel_sprout be very unique -PRON- like then a lot as do -PRON- girlfriend
overall the entree be great and be huge
definitely could_not finish -PRON- all
for the portion $_12 be very_reasonable
-PRON- waitress be very_friendly and informative as be the rest_of the staff -PRON- encounter overall -PRON- experience be good and -PRON- will be sure to give -PRON- several return visit
ghetto
occasional strange people and smell
-PRON- be super_excited to eat at giada 's new restaurant since -PRON- love watch -PRON- cooking show
but sadly -PRON- be not impressed
the ambiance be classy and welcoming but the food be ok and the service be definitely not up to par
server barely check on -PRON-
honestly probably would not come_back here
-PRON- be seriously disappoint after -PRON- stop here last_night
both flavor of frozen_yogurt be fill with ice crystal and be very bland
the staff be indifferent almost to the point of surly even_though -PRON- be the only customer at the time
-PRON- walk_in with a smile expect something nice but -PRON- can say -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- have be come to this salon for year and -PRON- use to love come_here
over the past year -PRON- have notice that the management of the salon have go downhill
-PRON- always make an_appt before -PRON- come usually week in_advance
every_time -PRON- have come -PRON- have be backlogg and take other customer that be walk_in before -PRON-
typically -PRON- have wait over half_an_hour beyond -PRON- appointment time to be see
-PRON- do_not understand the purpose of an_appt if -PRON- do_not seem to affect when -PRON- be -PRON- see
-PRON- would give this nail_salon 5_star if -PRON- be just for quality of service but unfortunately the lack of appointment management and general confusion about order of see customer typically ruin the experience
-PRON- and -PRON- boyfriend go there for lunch unlimited sushi and other variety_of asian plate -PRON- be really worth -PRON- for the price 17 $
quality of sushis be amazing -PRON- be fresh -PRON- strongly suggest to try the peanut_butter chicken that have that perfect sweet taste
restaurant be clean and have nice and modern decor
really good overall experience
-PRON- flower arrangement be gorgeous
the attention to detail and excellent customer_service be what keep -PRON- come_back
highly_recommend
-PRON- absolutelylove
this_place
the seafood quesadilla be amazing
all the margaritas be amazing but the diamanté negro martini be to die
yum
this be an extremely smoky bar with terrible music
the atmosphere be not there the music be so low that no one really talk
the food be just ok and the service be very mediocre
the crowd be in -PRON- 50 be so -PRON- be not much action as most people be gamble
this bar need a major facelift
-PRON- would probably not recommend -PRON- to anyone as there be good place to experience
-PRON- do_not_know a lot about this_place so let -PRON- focus_on what -PRON- like
the inside be really nice
-PRON- have a big bar a big beer_selection -PRON- be nice open airy
the patio be really nice too
the fireplace be huge and warm and there be just the right_amount_of table
so -PRON- be still intimate
-PRON- have only try a couple of the food item but both be about as good as -PRON- get
the irish egg_roll be like crispy stuff reubens and oh so good
-PRON- get the apple cider chicken at the recommendation of yelper dana p -PRON- know_what -PRON- be talk_about
this chicken be amazing and -PRON- have to try -PRON-
one would never suspect a cranberry and mushroom combo to be this delicious
but -PRON- love every_bite
the carrot mash thing that accompany -PRON- that -PRON- could do without
-PRON- should have get some potato or something
-PRON- only_complaint and the reason -PRON- give -PRON- 3_star be that -PRON- think -PRON- be over price
-PRON- entree the chicken be $_13 and -PRON- be just one small chicken_breast
-PRON- do_not_know maybe -PRON- expectation be skewed because -PRON- could have eat a whole plate of -PRON-
or maybe -PRON- be just poor
-PRON- probably will go_back this summer but -PRON- think as more of a beer and appetizer place
so_glad to have find great thai in -PRON- neighborhood
-PRON- think when -PRON- move away_from tempe that -PRON- have lose -PRON- access to great ethnic food
luckily -PRON- find this little_gem
great ambience friendly quick service and fantastic food
-PRON- order the green_curry chicken and the drunken_noodle with vegetable
great sized_portion for reasonable_price
-PRON- get -PRON- on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and -PRON- be perfect for -PRON-
-PRON- have a feeling
-PRON- will become regular
the food be ok
the price be a_little_bit high_than outside but -PRON- should appreciate -PRON- can bring authentic chinese_food into the middle_of a casino
the major problem here be that the place always ask how -PRON- be go to pay before place order
-PRON- suggest the place may suffer from ample unpaid check at
bellagio
so show -PRON- -PRON- wallet before place order to calm -PRON- down
go to the one in_vegas at like 4 am and have really high_expectation for this_place
-PRON- prefer breakfast food over lunch food
so -PRON- be really excited to try -PRON- especially with -PRON- be feature on the food network
-PRON- friend and -PRON- split the corned_beef hash and -PRON- come_out and be not what -PRON- imagine corned_beef hash to be
there be chunk of meat instead_of slice of meat and -PRON- do_not look appetizing at all
-PRON- also do_not taste good
the portion be huge so maybe that be why a lot_of people really like -PRON-
would never_go_back here again
pizza care have great pizza
-PRON- have try a couple different pizza -PRON- have all be really good
-PRON- recommend the multi grain crust -PRON- be flavorful crispy not too doughy like some pizza
also love the side of ranch -PRON- give -PRON- with the pizza to dip -PRON- crust in
-PRON- have also have the veggie the fish hoagie
the hoagie be ok nothing_special
not really worth get -PRON- would stick with -PRON- pizza
-PRON- really like that -PRON- be use healthy ingredient
no preservative or tran fat use olive_oil in -PRON- crust healthy crust option -PRON- cheese be all natural
-PRON- know pizza be not exactly healthy for -PRON- however -PRON- be nice to have a healthy choice if -PRON- be go to eat pizza once in a while
pizza care be a great addition to the city -PRON- do_not believe there be any_other pizza shop around pittsburgh that have these healthy option
when -PRON- not insanely crowded which -PRON- almost always be
body english be one of the good place to dance in the city
this venue boast crowd both inside and out thus the tricky part be get in a timely_manner
know one of the promoter be always helpful but at this_place -PRON- less crazy than the line at pure or rain per se
rockin music from live act house music from talented spin dj on the weekend and hip_hop music from a kick ass sound_system be one of the few reason to appreciate this_place
the drink be insanely price but few club in_las_vegas ever have good deal on drink
most people that be here for that be already drunk or buzz before -PRON- even get through the door
since the place be not amazingly large -PRON- good to enjoy the moment before 1am\/2am rush of people begin pour into the place
also -PRON- hard to enjoy this_place if one do_not go in a group
that say the vicarious crowd of and beautiful staff often time make up for the little inadequacy that surround this hard_rock mainstay
do_not really do what -PRON- ask
but for $_5 -PRON- can_not really complain
-PRON- ask for a fade and do_not get one
ask for a trim up top and all -PRON- do be thin -PRON- out
if -PRON- be a bum and need a desperate haircut this be the place for -PRON-
a lovely new space to practice
the place have be completely renovate since -PRON- be yogatree
-PRON- have take 2 warm vinyasa class with steve
both be great class
not too hot dynamic
-PRON- do a great_job of modify up and down for all level
if steve be indicative of the caliber of teacher this_place be a find
front_desk_staff be also friendly and welcoming
the practice room be spacious with radiant heater
-PRON- can easily find spot not directly under the heater if -PRON- be one 's preference -PRON- be -PRON-
no mirror
some like that some do_not
-PRON- be indifferent
the change room be clean but very tight
only 2 shower which have not be a problem for -PRON- yet because after both class only -PRON- shower and few people change beyond pull sweat over -PRON- yoga clothe
not many_people could change at once without be too close for comfort though
-PRON- would love a_bit_more space there
-PRON- other complaint be the last evening class be 7:30
too early for -PRON-
-PRON- can_not get home from work eat and digest enough to practice by 7:30
8 8:30 start would be good for -PRON-
for this reason -PRON- will_likely stick to -PRON- usual yoga spot but grab weekend class at yst when -PRON- can
if the schedule change to add later class -PRON- will reassess update
-PRON- return to yogaspace thornhill in august this time as -PRON- primary studio since the schedule at -PRON- former studio no long suit -PRON-
ys have change -PRON- evening class to 8_p.m. and bring in some excellent local teacher in_addition to -PRON- already excellent exist staff
sandy mchugh and yvonne eastwood be both fantastic vinyasa teacher and -PRON- try a class with michelle palma that be excellent and be still love steve 's class
well do yogaspace
kind_of a huge deal in montreal but honestly the food be only good
-PRON- be tasty smoke_meat and bread on the menu with some fry and side option but -PRON- focus_on that brisket
the meat -PRON- be salty than -PRON- like and the lean be a bit_dry while the medium be way_too fat
good thing
-PRON- wait be short be a weekday afternoon because -PRON- do_not really get all the hype
the poutine -PRON- order be surprisingly good though
not too_salty and very crispy fry not quite drown in gravy -PRON- be -PRON- favourite thing here not to say do_not come
but -PRON- would prefer wait for something good
-PRON- be worth -PRON- to say -PRON- have try -PRON- though
although rush and quick service the people work there be really nice
-PRON- stay_here last_week for about 5days and -PRON- be heaven in a hotel -PRON- give -PRON- a robe and slippers!!!. the lobby room as_well_as the bar inside be super modern and the entire staff be friendly
-PRON- love how when -PRON- check in -PRON- deliver -PRON- bag to -PRON- room -PRON- be sure that be probably common but -PRON- still love that
oh_yeah when -PRON- check in -PRON- give -PRON- complimentary drink ticket which work with most of -PRON- bar inside the hotel
-PRON- stay in a double queen room suite and boy be the room spacious
the furniture to the bed and painting be all up to date and classy
the bathroom be unbelievable
-PRON- have a -PRON- and -PRON- sink as_well_as a separate shower and spacious bath tube
do -PRON- mention -PRON- have a tv in -PRON-
oh_yeah
and if -PRON- have not read from other post 's these room come with 1.5 bathroom
aside_from the master bathroom there be another one when -PRON- first walk_in
also the radio\/alarm clock have an ipod holder
so -PRON- get to play -PRON- itouch in -PRON- room feel_like -PRON- be at home
-PRON- really accommodate with people very well
only_downside room service food take almost an_hour
-PRON- mean when -PRON- drunk and hungry the last thing -PRON- want to do be wait for food
lastly the pool be really beautiful -PRON- be like a beach and have a wave pool
as for the spa bathouse -PRON- be super lucky to have score a discount with -PRON- hotel package
-PRON- get an_amazing massage and pedi for a reasonable discount cost
plus the spa be open to use all day when -PRON- book a service and -PRON- have great amenity fresh juice bobby pin hair tie hairspray razor ect
if -PRON- look for a peaceful modern and comfortable hotel then -PRON- recommend_this_place
-PRON- be connect to mandalay_bay which be connect to luxor which be connect to excalibur -PRON- be not close near everything lively but -PRON- be vegas and everything be accessible with a taxi
note to people
who travel
-PRON- got an_excellent deal by search around
check_out retailmenot.com for hotel discount
-PRON- have discount for everything basically
-PRON- have a disappointing experience here
-PRON- fiancé and -PRON- be in_phoenix for the weekend and make_an_appointment to look_at a specific ring design
-PRON- be very busy with the holiday weekend and have several walk_in so no one be available to help -PRON- in spite of make_an_appointment ahead of time
the jeweler -PRON- book with never do get free and after about 30_minute other sale people become available and continue to ignore -PRON-
-PRON- finally leave 45_minute after -PRON- schedule appointment time without look_at anything
-PRON- understand -PRON- be busy
but -PRON- wish -PRON- would have just tell -PRON- -PRON- be not go to have time for the appointment so -PRON- would not have waste the afternoon
so -PRON- friend and i who be all in the bar industry stop_by there tonight 7\/2\/15 around 11:40am
-PRON- have get there before -PRON- -PRON- come over after -PRON- get off work
-PRON- all wait about 25 min before -PRON- be even approach to have -PRON- drink order take
to put -PRON- in an even good perspective -PRON- each almost gamble $_40 before -PRON- be approach
the only_reason -PRON- do_not be because -PRON- stop gamble
one of the female bartender even come over to get one of -PRON- friend shoot order that a regular_customer be buy for -PRON- from across the bar -PRON- be good friend with that particular regular and i do_not even get acknowledge then and -PRON- be sit right_next to -PRON- friend get the shot gambling no drink in hand
the only_reason the one of three bartender come over and take -PRON- order be because -PRON- friend finally waive -PRON- down to get -PRON- attention
and -PRON- do_not receive a smile a hello a how or -PRON- nothing
-PRON- walk_around the bar as if -PRON- have no purpose for 5_min and eating before come to tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of orange_juice for -PRON- drink
really
-PRON- understand -PRON- get there 20_min before shift change but even the grave bartender do_not come over and greet -PRON- after -PRON- get settle
-PRON- be all severely unimpressed with this experience and -PRON- personally will not be back
if -PRON- be the owner\/manager\/investor
-PRON- would seriously reconsider -PRON- staff
for the price this_place be awesome
only setback be -PRON- wish there be a big selection
since become a vegetarian over a year_ago -PRON- be still come_here
-PRON- get the great pretender burger which be -PRON- veggie patty super delicious
-PRON- have also have the black_bean burger and that be great as_well
the appetizer be still great and the service remain solid
recently -PRON- mother_'s a\/c be blow warm and need some professional attention
-PRON- do some research to find a local hvac outfit
and -PRON- find absolute
-PRON- call mike late on a friday and -PRON- arrange -PRON- schedule to come_out first thing in the morning to troubleshoot the system

-PRON- can also ask for more croutron
the dessert be awesome and well make
the nutella moelleux be extremely soft and chewy

the place -PRON- be clean
would definitely_come_back
very kind and patient staff with -PRON- scaredy cat english bulldog mix marley
this be the only place in the city -PRON- trust for a quick and perfect nail clip every_time
also a cute shop with adorable accessory and a good selection of sweater food and treat
sesame chicken be hard
no doubt -PRON- be freeze from walmart
both -PRON- and the szechuan chicken
-PRON- order come with broccoli the new chinese vegetable
why only broccoli and onion in chinese_food these day
nasty
anyway the broccoli be not cook at all
hard to chew have to nuke mine and toss the rest
to be a good restaurant or good -PRON- must cook -PRON- food people
-PRON- have go to this_location for year
-PRON- be repeatedly change owner and people
tired of waste -PRON- money on sorry food
sad thing be maricopa county as a whole have some very bad restaurant
-PRON- would say 90 serve overpriced and sorry prepared if not frozen food
-PRON- will cook at home and save lot_of money
-PRON- like that
good chicken_finger
a little loud but fun
-PRON- would give a 3 +
the service be great the restaurant be clean and nice atmosphere
presentation be beautiful but -PRON- dish chicken tetrazzini lack the flavor -PRON- be expect
the steak gorgonzola -PRON- be tell be excellent
all in all good food for the price and a decent wine_selection at a good price point
what a wonderful experience
the selection be mind boggle and thr warmth and hospitality be truly remarkable thank to rachel
-PRON- walk_away with almost 200 $ in cheese and sooo much_more
definitely a place to visit again before i leave the midw
recently renovate
still work some bug out but in_general a nice downtown business hotel
staff be friendly and the doorman be a god send in help -PRON- find some local shopping option
the decor be contemporary and not quite -PRON- style
but clean and lien line be positively implement
-PRON- cant believe they just tell me
fuck your mom
-PRON- just stop over here this morning because -PRON- mom have to use the restroom really bad and could_not hold -PRON- any longer
but when -PRON- go in -PRON- do_not want to let -PRON-
but then -PRON- mom say -PRON- could_not hold -PRON- any longer
and -PRON- let -PRON-
but as -PRON- be leave the guy harass -PRON- as -PRON- leave and that be when -PRON- step out of the car
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would have buy some water or something in the store that -PRON- have so that -PRON- could have use -PRON- without get harass
but -PRON- just say get out of here
and as -PRON- be leave the security say get the fuck
outta
here and fuck you're mom
and that be when -PRON- get pissed and start yell_at -PRON-
after that -PRON- push -PRON- and hit -PRON- in the face
-PRON- be a light hit but a hit be a hit and now -PRON- be press charge against -PRON-
be this how you treat disabled woman
be this
how
you
talk_about people on a daily basis
shame on
you guy
-PRON- be talk to the guy man to man -PRON- do_not have to say f$&@ -PRON- mom
if -PRON- could give negative_star -PRON- would
-PRON- book this_company online after call -PRON- and explain that -PRON- have a rental home that be not leave in great condition
the receptionist help -PRON- make the selection of service that -PRON- need
the total 298.00 for a 1300 sq
ft
3 bedroom 2 bath home
-PRON- think -PRON- be a little_pricey since the cleaning lady that -PRON- use in -PRON- own home charge 20 $ per hour
but probably fair give the condition of the home
-PRON- husband and -PRON- even drive up to the property in the morning to make_sure all trash be remove and house be completely empty and all appliance be remove
two lady show_up
-PRON- talk_about the service -PRON- prepurchas
and then -PRON- leave
an_hour later -PRON- get a call say that the price have change to $_100 per hour
luckily -PRON- be just around the corner purchase new appliance when -PRON- get the call
-PRON- choose not to continue the cleaning and go_back to the property
-PRON- be a move out
so -PRON- have just finish take picture that morning
when -PRON- return the house be in the same condition as what -PRON- leave so -PRON- take more picture in case -PRON- charge -PRON- card
-PRON- come home to an email say -PRON- would not be charge for the partial cleaning
-PRON- do_not even do anything
this be clearly a bait and switch upcharge company that -PRON- will not be use again
seriously the most unprofessional experience that -PRON- have ever have with any company
the food be not very good -PRON- get a bean enchilada and -PRON- be pretty soggy and bland
the waitress seem_like -PRON- do_not really care and do_not want to be there
-PRON- give -PRON- chip and salsa beforehand though
-PRON- wish this spot be on -PRON- side of town because this park be fantastic
-PRON- end_up here because for some crazy reason -PRON- think -PRON- could run a 5 k enter the insane inflatable race
this be not just a 5 k but an obstacle course on steroid and fully equip with bounce house rope climbing giant ball pit and snarky kid on razor scooter chastise -PRON- as -PRON- gasp for air
this race be a lot fun and -PRON- do recommend people to try -PRON- out when -PRON- come_back to vegas next_year
as -PRON- walk_through the park both on -PRON- way to the race and sluggishly back to the car -PRON- really notice the layout of this awesome park
build in stone playground with flintstone style slide a cushion ground for safe landing and manmade pond fully equip with goose and a_few duck
-PRON- be assume this be what sunset park look_like before the picnic mass decide to make this -PRON- permanent happy birthday dump ground
the parking situation here be vast so no_matter where -PRON- decide to park -PRON- will be within a_few foot of some sweet park action
day at the park if -PRON- be at craig ranch regional park then count -PRON- in
-PRON- have be shop here for asian food for very long_time -PRON- price be cheap compare to other asian store in_madison
one stop shop to make filipino dish
-PRON- just do_not buy the fresh fish or any meat -PRON- have
dirty and smelly -PRON- always try to do -PRON- shopping there as fast as -PRON- could sometimes -PRON- can_not stand the smell
yue wah asian store be a lot clean so -PRON- sometimes shop there to
this review be for katerina
-PRON- have an email dialogue before -PRON- come in for the cut
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want to cut off 1.5 inch max
very clear
-PRON- come in on the day
-PRON- be very standoffish and rude
and -PRON- look_at -PRON- hair and say because -PRON- already have layer
-PRON- have to cut off closer to what -PRON- hold up which be 3_4 inch
otherwise -PRON- be not worth -PRON- time
such a waste of -PRON- time
be -PRON- kid -PRON-
-PRON- even send -PRON- photo of -PRON- hair
so -PRON- know exactly_what -PRON- be get into
-PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- want
and -PRON- just would not listen
walk right out
very rude would not recommend
go right around the corner and go_somewhere_else
amazing breakfast food and especially love the warm welcome of be lead to -PRON- seat by the hand
already be back 2x in a week for breakfast
-PRON- have be there four time
and -PRON- always leave satisfied
-PRON- will most_likely spend a hundred buck for two people but well_worth -PRON-
very_friendly staff
-PRON- only_complaint be that there be always a lineup when -PRON- walk_in
-PRON- switch chef
-PRON- miss -PRON- tasty thyme y chicken_wing
hell a lot_of the food be not as great as -PRON- be but -PRON- be still good enough to give a try
-PRON- onion_ring be amazing though -PRON- hubby still love the cod taco
well today -PRON- get -PRON- 2nie tuesday for lunch get back to work and the chicken be pink and a litle bloody inside
-PRON- be absolutely horrified because -PRON- think kfc have cooking protocol
-PRON- will_never visit this_location ever again because -PRON- do_not want salmonella or e.coli thank p.s
-PRON- cook obviously do_not_know_what -PRON- be do because be not chicken -PRON- main dish
wtf
-PRON- have -PRON- landscape -PRON- back yard
-PRON- do uplighting rock tree assorted desert plant mound and extend the drip system
-PRON- would say -PRON- do well for the mound rock uplighting and drip system
-PRON- would not recommend for tree installation on the basis -PRON- feel -PRON- do_not really know_how to properly stake or plant a tree
-PRON- have a tree a few_month after break during a monsoon and -PRON- want to charge -PRON- to replace -PRON-
if -PRON- would have stake -PRON- properly -PRON- would not have snap
also have another tree die and -PRON- be able_to pull -PRON- right out of the ground which tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not plant -PRON- correctly
-PRON- restak one tree to fix -PRON- poor planting of -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- choose good shrub
but -PRON- think -PRON- be plant in the wrong area
what an_amazing experience
-PRON- pilot andrew make -PRON- wind dancer sunset trip to the grand canyon a complete success

-PRON- be sometimes difficult to reach anyone by phone
-PRON- have long_wait time each_time
make_sure that -PRON- carefully check -PRON- confirmation email as -PRON- accidentally book the wrong date and be charge even more to reschedule
if -PRON- have not want to go on this trip so badly -PRON- would have cancel and dispute the charge because of the way this be handle at first
a manager do ultimately resolve the issue

-PRON- use to love_this_place and -PRON- ruin -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- could_not get the porterhouse cook right
first -PRON- switch the temps on -PRON- prime_rib and -PRON- portehouse so -PRON- porterhouse come_out med rare and -PRON- prime_rib come_out
med well
-PRON- turn to fix -PRON- and could_not get -PRON- porterhouse cook right
finally -PRON- just offer to take the porterhouse off the check
-PRON- would hope so
-PRON- be not eat at all
this whole_experience be crap
the only_reason -PRON- be give -PRON- three_star be because of the bus edgar

-PRON- dog be and -PRON- with professionalism and respect
the dr and staff be extremely attentive
-PRON- dog 's will_continue to patronize -PRON- for a long_time
start with the staff -PRON- find -PRON- to be very_friendly and very_nice
-PRON- be thankful that -PRON- be there and do everything -PRON- could to accommodate -PRON- and a rather large_group
this be a very hard work staff as -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to ensure that -PRON- be be serve properly and be happy
the food be tasty although -PRON- be probably bad for -PRON- but that be ok because what be -PRON- expect anyway
-PRON- recommend the chicken_finger -PRON- be good -PRON- also recommend the nachos those be pretty yummy as_well
if -PRON- be there for beer -PRON- will probably be ok with the selection -PRON- have
however if -PRON- be there for well drink move on find another place
-PRON- drink be water_down
although the price seem to be ok on those well drink the reality be that -PRON- be not get much of a punch out of -PRON-
and while -PRON- food and craft_beer selection be pretty_good this be such a disappointing aspect of this_place
-PRON- be really hop for something a little better on those well drink
-PRON- give -PRON- two_star because of -PRON- service and because of -PRON- pretty decently tasting food
however -PRON- have a big issue with -PRON- well drink
this joint be actually good_than lucky strike
ok
well -PRON- be not
-PRON- be the same except that lucky strike have good food and this_place have way way good service
the drink be good at lucky strike but this_place have pool_table
this_place just feel less disjointed that ls -PRON- feel more like a place where people_who actually know_how to bowl and play pool would not be embarrassed to show_up
-PRON- be a sport_bar that be plenty comfy for -PRON- girl and -PRON- business pal
do -PRON-
-PRON- be a seasonal resident and have be deal with bulwark for about 5_year
superb service whether -PRON- be over the phone or the onsite technician

there be item that be $ 0.25 $_7.50 overchared
also tax be incorrectly calculate as_well
the waitress tell -PRON- that each item price on the check include_tax but this be obviously incorrect since some item on the check actually match the menu price while other be high_than the menu price
-PRON- hope the manager(s decide to convert to a computerized system
here be a_few tip pho bamboo

-PRON- often visit the store two hour before close and there be no line
the store be somewhat clean but -PRON- feel that -PRON- could be a lot clean
the employee be somewhat nice because -PRON- greet -PRON- when -PRON- come in but hold little to no conversation with -PRON- while -PRON- be fix -PRON- food

how do a sandwich place that specialize_in sandwich do_not have turkey
the employee tell -PRON- this after -PRON- be half way do with -PRON- finance order

4\/5 clean and spacious
-PRON- have a month pass here for top rope climbing
this be a great place for group
the staff be friendly
climber tend_to keep to -PRON- compare to other climbing gym
the route be long and fun but do_not change very frequently
the icicle climb right at the front be very fun and if -PRON- make -PRON- to the top be sure to look out the window and gloat about how -PRON- see the cn tower
bouldering corner be small and very cluster
-PRON- be not easy mapping out problem
for this reason this be more of a top rope\/lead rope kind_of place
the change room be surprisingly spacious with plenty_of locker
shower be available
-PRON- would_recommend this_place for first_timer if -PRON- be go with someone_who have go before
also great for occasional drop in
climb do_not alternate enough for -PRON- to justify monthly pass
move here from boston and fly to boston and new_york ~3x\/year -PRON- hair grow slow ok for a haircut be get a little expensive
-PRON- never ever think -PRON- could find someone talented for a short haircut that could grow out and become another style before -PRON- be cut again
through a friend -PRON- hear_about ryan 's
-PRON- go here and be really nervous
-PRON- be go to walk_out with a boring cut like -PRON- have at ~3 other place in_charlotte

-PRON- order caesar_salad and pasta
when the salad come the lettuce have start to rot turn red and black
so -PRON- send -PRON- back for another
one would assume that the next when would come_back in excellent shape but -PRON- come_back worse than the 1st
so -PRON- nix the salad and have -PRON- pasta which be ok
do_not_know if -PRON- would give this_location a 2nd chance
the only_reason -PRON- would consider be bc -PRON- have a much good experience at the other location
please take a moment to read about some killer customer_service
for those_who know -PRON- -PRON- know -PRON- car have look_like crap for a very long_time when people ask what_happen -PRON- become a joke to answer one word bobcat not like the yellow piece_of heavy machinery but as in a real live
now dead bobcat that -PRON- hit on the way to havasu falls
-PRON- do_not want to turn -PRON- into insurance
and -PRON- also take -PRON- car off road enough that -PRON- be worried if -PRON- get -PRON- fix
-PRON- would break -PRON- again
so -PRON- keep drive -PRON- look all crappy and broken and the previously paint fender 's paint look horrible from an_old paint job
-PRON- finally get tired of -PRON-
so -PRON- reach out to -PRON- buddy @gabe_soto_006 at nevada auto collision and then drop -PRON- off to -PRON- while -PRON- be out of town this month on 2 of 3 trip
from paint and instal the bumper to paint the fender to even fix the trunk where -PRON- neighbor have back into -PRON- car and do_not say a word -PRON- be super affordable and look fantastic

semi sweet chocolate and toffee
nothing like walk home eat a warm cookie
-PRON- have also try the already cook one the gluten_free one be very very_tasty
-PRON- problem be that -PRON- be so close to -PRON- gym after -PRON- work out temptation await
every_time -PRON- have be there -PRON- have be blow_away in all the good way
service quality consistency friendliness design flavor
-PRON- be just incredible from top to bottom
huge recommendation
these be very_nice apartment and the amenity be amazing but these apartment be a rip_off
not only can -PRON- not pay with personal check -PRON- have to pay cash cashier check or online
which -PRON- push on -PRON- hard
but in order to use the online service- -PRON- be charge_$ 3 minimum to use -PRON- for -PRON- bank account routing\/acct s or to use a debit\/credit card -PRON- will be charge_$ 43 on_top_of -PRON- monthly rent
-PRON- do_not do a pet deposit -PRON- do a pet charge
$_300 for one pet
non refundable
make_sure -PRON- fulfill -PRON- lease commitment
there lease break requirement be basically 3x the amount_of rent
-PRON- sign a 3 month lease and pay for a portion of march all of april all of may and all of june
-PRON- have live in a_few apartment and -PRON- have never have to pay so_many fee just to get in
-PRON- pay_$ 50 per_person
just to apply for this_place
go_somewhere else- do_not_waste -PRON- money here
plus -PRON- security be a joke
the noise complaint do nothing
ps the pool be not heated lol
update
-PRON- have respond below and -PRON- just want to give a reply back
yes -PRON- realize the agreement -PRON- sign have those fee but when -PRON- sign them- -PRON- thought- eh
this_place look awesome can_not wait to live here and
-PRON- that -PRON- would be worth -PRON-
then after about 2_week -PRON- realize that -PRON- have be mistaken
-PRON- stand by what -PRON- have say above and continue to not recommend these apartment to everyone
maybe -PRON- guy should take into consideration all -PRON- review and make some change then -PRON- would get good review
never have a dish -PRON- do_not like from here
-PRON- co_worker and -PRON- always order from here
-PRON- quick and staff be awesome
though sometimes hard to understand because of the accent
the pop sticker 's be delicious
-PRON- be thai food all the time at the rise
meh nothing exciting
fresh decent reasonably_price
taste_like harvey 's burger
after come to bouchon for -PRON- friend 's_birthday a month_ago -PRON- wife and -PRON- know that when -PRON- come_back for valentines day weekend -PRON- would go_back
both occasion -PRON- have brunch
even_though -PRON- do_not take reservation for weekend brunch the wait of approximately 30_minute do_not bother -PRON- at all when wait in this gem house in the venetian
order the chicken and waffle on the waiter request and -PRON- be absolutely_delicious
pair that with coffee and finish the meal with the beignet have -PRON- day a perfect start
service quality and the feeling of not feel_like -PRON- be in_vegas make bouchon a must visit every_time -PRON- do visit vegas
just happen to be nearby when -PRON- stay in lake las_vegas peep -PRON- head into what be one of the small casino -PRON- have see
no table game everything be video
even a video roulette and video black jack with a dealer
-PRON- guess -PRON- should not expect much since there be not much in the lake las_vegas area
this_place have make great improvement
when -PRON- first start stop_by this_place the staff seem to be very young and immature
-PRON- have a hard time get -PRON- order right
-PRON- seem that the staff do_not take -PRON- job seriously
with the mediocre service and bland food -PRON- stop go to this restaurant
the other day -PRON- be run_late for an_appointment and want something quick and healthy
to -PRON- surprise there be a totally different staff
the service be much good and -PRON- food order be quickly make and give to -PRON-
if -PRON- can continue good service as this -PRON- will be more_than happy to frequent this_establishment
love the whole_experience here
sushi amazing love the cucumber roll a bit_pricey but very good
the hamachi be delicious -PRON- cocktail be very good
the good be the crispy rice cook to perfection love the music and ambiance get -PRON- in the mood to party after dinner
if -PRON- get the chance to check_out town square and do some shopping tommy bahama 's be a great place to eat lunch or dinner
-PRON- be so nice to sit_outside on the patio when the weather be nice
sometimes there be a band play live_music in the grassy area nearby which set a nice atmosphere
-PRON- have try
loki loki tuna poke
fresh ahi napoleon guacamole caper soy and sesame oil with island flatbread $ 16.50 love it
saba steak salad marinated char grill tenderloin medallion grill potato roma tomato shiitake chip garlic aioli tamarind vinaigrette $ 17.50 cabo fish tacos blackened white fish blend corn flour tortilla pico de gallo chipotle aioli asian slaw $ 14.00
-PRON- be pleased_with everything each_time -PRON- eat_here
oh and the bread with butter -PRON- bring_out be awesome yummy
have a layover be crave a cheeseburger so -PRON- think this would be the perfect place
-PRON- put in -PRON- name wait 5 10_minute
the hostess be giggle and do_not seem to care much about customer_service
-PRON- do_not make much eye contact or smile and seem to have a_bit of an attitude
when -PRON- be sit_down take another 5 10_minute for -PRON- server to take -PRON- order
-PRON- order the frenchie turkey burger
-PRON- take another 15_20 minute to come_out
the food be pretty_good but the wait time be way_too long especially for an airport
-PRON- server do_not come check on -PRON- so -PRON- have to get up and grab some silverware -PRON-
-PRON- check take another 5 10_minute after -PRON- request -PRON- while eat
while eat -PRON- notice probably 80 of the server do_not look happy at all
not a typical stressed cause it's busy look but really a -PRON- hate this_place look
do_not make a pleasant atmosphere when everyone have attitude
the table be also cram very close to each_other
the atmosphere overall be really even for an airport
very loud in there
-PRON- would not return
-PRON- be 2_star and not 1 because -PRON- usually just give 1_star if the food be inedible and the actual food be pretty_good although messy
do_not like -PRON- food be plain and bore nothing_special about this_place
-PRON- make a good breakfast\/lunch at home
service be ok -PRON- be the only one in there
most_likely not go_back
valid thru 7 jul there be a celebrate bbq at bj 's with a free entree of equal\/lesser value with purchase of an entree
offer -PRON- can obtain by click on -PRON- at https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bjsrestaurant great beer lunch meal special convenient location near costco lowe 's best buy etc
friendly service nice decor and reasonable_price
the bad ihop -PRON- have ever be to
this be the second_time where there be only two table and three server
-PRON- wait a good ten_minute before someone even acknowledge -PRON- as -PRON- grab -PRON- own menu to seat -PRON-
so -PRON- get sit again there be only two table and three server run_around
-PRON- sit for fifteen_minute while the server would pass -PRON- and not even_bother to ask if -PRON- want something to drink
-PRON- end_up get up and leave and as -PRON- walk_out
-PRON- tell one of the server no one bother to come over to -PRON-
no_apology nothing
-PRON- just leave
personally -PRON- would spit on -PRON- establishment and the person that train these_guy
-PRON- be not expect a five_star dining experiencing but come on at_least good service than that
-PRON- will be call the manager
-PRON- have be to vegas every year for the last 6 year since turn 21 and always make an event out of -PRON-
these club crawl have become popular for the last 3 or 4 year and this trip -PRON- finally try one out
-PRON- choose sin city club crawl base_on review and price and -PRON- be glad -PRON- do
-PRON- do the saturday_night package which start out at pbr rockbar
-PRON- include a free drink free eat and then a ton_of free beer as -PRON- start play drinking game
-PRON- also go during the rodeo so see miss rodeo usa on the mechanical bull definitely catch -PRON- attention
-PRON- then go to gallery which be a really nice bar\/club scene
-PRON- wish -PRON- stay a few_minute longer as the pussycat dolls be about to dance
-PRON- then take a party bus to the chateau and that include a bunch_of free drink and dance on the stripper pole
one thing -PRON- notice up to here be how the host be so good about make_sure everyone have a great time
-PRON- dance and meet with a lot_of new people and even try to meet_up with some of -PRON- the next_day
-PRON- be great host
chateau have a good size line but -PRON- do_not wait -PRON- walk up and right in to the club
the club be big and have a lot_of dancing
the drink be pricey but one drink keep -PRON- buzz enough
great view on the balcony here
-PRON- then take the party bus to pure which be actually a little disappointing but before go in -PRON- ask about the strip club to end the night and -PRON- be tell to call the number on the wristband
-PRON- actually like be chaperon all night and not have to think about what_happen next so not have -PRON- flashy light guide -PRON- into another bus drop -PRON- off to nude woman be a little disappointing and ultimately -PRON- miss out on that bonus stop
either_way -PRON- will always make_sure -PRON- do this club crawl when -PRON- be in_vegas
well_worth -PRON-
thank -PRON- lady barista who make -PRON- drink just right every_time
-PRON- review be mixed
-PRON- mother
and -PRON- go in for main pedi
-PRON- be there for a full set of acrylic with gel_polish
-PRON- want gel on the fingernail but standard polish on the toe
mom be there for the standard french mani pedi
positive comment
the full set acrylic work be very good
no too bulky
-PRON- be also very_impressed that -PRON- could match any gel_polish choice with the same standard polish color
-PRON- get gel on the new acrylic and standard on the toe
-PRON- match perfectly
negative comment
mother be not satisfied with the workmanship on -PRON- french mani and pedi
-PRON- comment that -PRON- look_like a child have do -PRON-
both pedicure
-PRON- could have last longer
the initial soak be in straight up warm water
nothing add
so less_than 5_minute of -PRON- foot go in -PRON- be pull -PRON- out and work on the toe
-PRON- only use a small cheap pumice on -PRON- foot
the massage be very short
would -PRON- go again
probably not
there be good point but not good enough to make -PRON- return
again my full set acrylic be good however -PRON- should have do a third coat of that particular gel_polish -PRON- can see through the nail tip
this_place be great
sad
-PRON- only have 3 breakfast to work -PRON- way_through the menu
-PRON- get the egg bennie"- a twist on traditional egg_benedict with savory bread_pudding instead_of english_muffin
-PRON- mess with -PRON- head a_little_bit since -PRON- be use to sweet bread_pudding but -PRON- love try_something_different and this be definitely unique
-PRON- fiancé get the chili rellano which be bomb
tomorrow -PRON- think -PRON- be go to go red_velvet pancake
the service be wonderful- -PRON- be seat quickly and have a lovely waitress who give -PRON- giant water to go so -PRON- could brave the phoenix sun
very_disappointed
-PRON- love_this_place but seem this_location so happen to never have what -PRON- want
-PRON- say -PRON- be out
ok so there be a new promotion go on
-PRON- say and this be what prompt -PRON- to go
-PRON- really go just for the new dessert but -PRON- be 5:30pm and -PRON- do_not have -PRON-
so -PRON- order some sushi and a drink and then try to order dessert
but -PRON- do_not have the cappuccino mouse cake
again this be -PRON- whole purpose of come
-PRON- even tell -PRON- server -PRON- will be order -PRON- before -PRON- even place -PRON- food order
-PRON- be very dissatisfied with this
-PRON- would not normally blast anyone but just seem that every_time -PRON- go there -PRON- be out of something
-PRON- be a no kill shelter so -PRON- be hard for -PRON- to hate
but
the s.p.c.a. use to have -PRON- so that -PRON- could walk_through the back where all of the dog be like most shelter do and look_at all of the available dog
the change -PRON- about a year_ago so that -PRON- can only see the dog through the picture online or on the album place at the front counter
why
-PRON- do_not_know
-PRON- slow down the process of see dog big time and also do_not this lower the adoption rate
some dog just be not photogenic and -PRON- be take away -PRON- chance to shine through personality
-PRON- be hard to judge a dog by just a picture
and -PRON- suck have -PRON- pull out a dog from the back and have to say no after realize the dog be big than -PRON- expect or have a different personality than -PRON- be look for
cats be still all in the 3_4 room
-PRON- be free to go in and look\/play with -PRON-
nothing have change there
service be good
the food be good and season well
-PRON- want fry_chicken
but -PRON- be out of white meat
-PRON- have grill salmon creamed potato mac and cheese and green_bean
definitely go_back and try the chicken
dog of all shape and size surround -PRON- and -PRON- can_not help but smile
first_time at bobby q 's today even_though -PRON- live less_than 10_min away
killer cornbread
have lunch platter with pull_pork pulled chicken and brisket
pork be good
like the sauce
chicken be juicy and tender
-PRON- be texan and bbq be in -PRON- blood so re brisket be just ok
no bark on -PRON-
and -PRON- be a little dry
roasted veggie be good side for lunch though -PRON- be sure the mac_n_cheese would have taste fantastic
will be back
ne serait ce que pour le décor et l'ambiance c' un must
les drink sont delicioso
this be -PRON- favourite pancho 's in the city
first_off the owner be super_friendly
-PRON- can tell -PRON- genuinely care_about provide a good guest experience
-PRON- also fry up some great churro so -PRON- be get
that go for -PRON- as_well
the churro be on_par with other churro place in the city
-PRON- get the dulce de leche filling which be -PRON- favourite one follow_by chocolate honestly though sometimes -PRON- just like -PRON- plain too
there be quite a_bit of seating unlike the dufferin location
-PRON- think this_place would serve better as a grab and go spot as_oppose to have so_much seating
-PRON- would like to stop in one day and try some of the other item -PRON- have
three churo for $_5 be a steal
recommend by a realtor -PRON- know
-PRON- do two local move for an elderly relative that sell -PRON- single family home and move -PRON- stuff into a storage unit
-PRON- use -PRON- the second_time when -PRON- be ready to move into -PRON- town home
-PRON- be very polite careful with -PRON- belonging and do exactly_what -PRON- promise to do
-PRON- highly_recommend -PRON- due_to -PRON- great work and reasonable hourly rate
thanks otto
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to a friend for -PRON- mother and -PRON- tell -PRON- today that -PRON- be go with -PRON- guy
glad to hear -PRON-
the only dim_sum in brampton like tremendous in mississauga
the dim_sum be alright and there be choice like tremendous
a must visit establishment in the point claire area of montreal
food be always cook to perfection and the wine_list be amazing
one of -PRON- rep bring -PRON- here for lunch_today
-PRON- have chip n guac
the guacamole be great as be the assorted salsa
-PRON- recommend the duck taco
-PRON- give the taco 4_star because -PRON- love duck and taco
the combination of the two be genius
bean and rice be bleh
not a whole lot_of flavor there
-PRON- waitress be kind_of a snatch
all in all a good time-
oops get here at 8:08 this morning and -PRON- be not ready to serve breakfast_burrito sorry would have like the breakfast_burrito from jefes today
-PRON- be way overrated
-PRON- be so look_forward_to the crack pie and -PRON- be ok
nice but nothing to be addict to
same with the cereal milk ice_cream
and -PRON- like cereal milk
but this be just ok
nothing that -PRON- really need to go_back for
same with the compost cookie
-PRON- have such high_expectation but -PRON- be so overpriced for what -PRON- get
try costco large chocolate walnut cookie 6 for $ 6.99 and -PRON- will know_what a 5_star cookie taste_like
there be so_many other good alternative to spend -PRON- calorie
-PRON- would rate sea as an average restaurant in_las_vegas
the pricing be reasonable and the food be average
-PRON- want a light meal
so -PRON- go with a couple of appetizer
the honey_walnut shrimp be tasty the appetizer portion have about_10 shrimp but there be way_too_much bread on -PRON-
the spring_roll be good especially the sauce that -PRON- be in
this be also a decent size portion
-PRON- friend that get the pad
thai -PRON- say -PRON- be average
-PRON- would_recommend this restaurant if -PRON- want something low_key
fun_vibe with great outdoor_seating and bar_area
-PRON- try three_different taco chicken pork salmon and all be excellent
if -PRON- do_not like a sauce -PRON- will leave -PRON- off and bring -PRON- eight more to_choose_from at -PRON- table all homemade and delicious
if -PRON- like salsa do_not skip the salsa chip
-PRON- be not free like most mexican_restaurant but -PRON- be far more tasty
-PRON- too be make fresh daily and the heat can vary
last_week -PRON- be milder last_night almost too hot for -PRON- but -PRON- wife love -PRON-
have to bring home an_extra order
-PRON- be go_back
although -PRON- do_not_care for the red sox -PRON- enjoy the atmosphere
the owner have that boston attitude but do -PRON- carefully not to sound threatening while have fun and needling
-PRON- be go_back and forth and have a good time -PRON- kid enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- get 4 slice of plain $ 2\/slice be not terrible pretty standard
-PRON- love -PRON-
thin_crust with a nice crisp and -PRON- can fold -PRON- in half and just chow on down
-PRON- kid split a chicken bomb sub be delicious
like a chicken cheese steak almost
the service be ok the other people that work there besides the owner just do_not seem to be into -PRON- as much
understandable
love the place though and wish -PRON- all the luck
keep -PRON- up
-PRON- come_here with a group_of 4 and -PRON- order the lola
overall the burger be delicious but honestly -PRON- be very hard to mess_up a burger with a juice thick cut of burger patty and fry egg
the pickle bar be definitely worthy of an add star
however all 4 burger order be overcook
-PRON- should be able_to cook the burger to how -PRON- be order for a place that specialize_in only burger
on_top_of that the fry be super greasy and soft not good
-PRON- still enjoy the flavor of -PRON- burger but the overall experience be just average
i technique come highly_recommend when -PRON- precious macbook pro die a_few day before -PRON- have to hand in a major report
not only do -PRON- learn the importance of back -PRON- stuff on a regular basis back up
back up
back up
but that -PRON- be hard to find a reliable and dependable shop that can help -PRON- with -PRON- problem
enter i technique
brad be knowledgeable and dependable and -PRON- feel very assured that the problem be go to get resolve
-PRON- be lucky that the problem with -PRON- laptop be fixable
i technique may be a little further away_from -PRON- house than the apple store at the eaton centre but -PRON- will happily make the trek to receive prompt exceptional_customer_service and great result
-PRON- try one at nyc -PRON- be waaaayyy good_than this one
the portion be so little for the price
the meat be dry and the rice be so greasy
one thing that -PRON- hate the most be -PRON- service
not_sure because -PRON- be new the line be move really slow
the people_who be work on the line be not pay_attention to what customer say so -PRON- have to say -PRON- 2_3 time and -PRON- yet still wrong
very crowded restaurant with mediocre service and food
-PRON- have a blta bacon lettuce tomato and avocado sandwich on sourdough bread
-PRON- be just ok and not memorable
the restaurant pack a great crowd
so maybe other option on the menu be more tasty and popular
the menu have so_many beef\/smok meat choice that -PRON- be difficult to make a decision
best doughnut in_town in the valley
the state the country in the world
basically -PRON- be the good
-PRON- have -PRON- orange pistachio doughnut and -PRON- change -PRON- life
-PRON- be a doughy doughnut and ugh -PRON- be so good
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_place
the worker be super_friendly and helpful
go here now
spend some time in here for dinner before a play across the street
dislike the $_5 beer special and a really good caesar_salad
dislike the server tell -PRON- -PRON- have to sit_at the bar because the place get busy when the game start
in two hour -PRON- be empty at the time
basically would not serve -PRON- until -PRON- move and be slow possibly on purpose after that
wings be terrible
-PRON- be schedule to be at -PRON- house at 8:00am and arrive at 7:40am which be perfect
-PRON- do a great_job clean both inside and out and the sun screen
there be even one screen that be difficult to get clean and tim go_back to the office to get a different cleaner for the stubborn dirt\/stain
well do job
-PRON- would use -PRON- again and -PRON- be very reasonably_price
-PRON- be in need of a class b cdl
-PRON- be recommend_this_place from other coworker
-PRON- take the pre trip class and the road test here
-PRON- be thorough yet easy to understand in -PRON- instruction
thank to -PRON- -PRON- pass
just a cozy tiny cafe in the heart of montreal
the breakfast item be not mind_blow
the service be great and the location be convenient
-PRON- just do_not find anything absolutely_amazing
always a very good experience when -PRON- get food here
the wing be fabulous and the wood_fire meatball pizza be amazing
the pizza consist_of basil fresh ricotta and meatball
these flavor just blend together perfectly
-PRON- do_not really see what the big_deal be about this_place
-PRON- go with a large_group so -PRON- have a fix price menu for $ 42 + 18 gratuity
the food be decent the duck_confit fry_rice be good
not worth the price imo
there be ton_of good mexican place downtown where -PRON- will get good value
the other problem with this_place be that -PRON- will not split the bill which be super annoying when -PRON- have a large_group
-PRON- take -PRON- an_extra 20_min to settle the bill so unfortunately -PRON- could_not turn the table over right_away
c'mon valdez get with -PRON-
shout_out to -PRON- man greg at the bar who have always take_care_of -PRON- and -PRON- friend every_single_time -PRON- come in
the staff be great and greg be on point all day everyday
quick service and friendly
tempe food be great but the staff make this_place one of a kind
the food here be absolutely excellent
have live in the south for a year -PRON- know good étouffée when -PRON- eat -PRON-
the outside of the building be beautiful and a_bit deceptive when compare to the actual dining_room which have way_too many table in -PRON-
so_many that the server could_not navigate the room without bump into -PRON- chair every_time -PRON- pass -PRON-
the dining_room be very loud too
perhaps due_to the fact_that the place be pack but loud nonetheless for a white table cloth experience
-PRON- start out in the bar but move to the dining_room because live_music from upstairs pour into the bar and make conversation challenging
this be top off by a child at the next table who cry loudly for at_least 20_minute
no one on the restaurant staff ask the parent to take the child outside so people could eat in peace
the service be ok to start but -PRON- empty plate sit in front of -PRON- for 20_minute before -PRON- ask the server to clear -PRON-
bottom_line excellent food but if -PRON- go again -PRON- will get the food to go
the atmosphere and service be good at home
-PRON- be quite happy that hakka legend be refer to -PRON-
-PRON- only go to hakka legend during_lunch hour when -PRON- be at work so -PRON- be not_sure how this_place be in the dinner time
what keep -PRON- come_back be the super cheap price -PRON- have on the lunch_special
and -PRON- be anything -PRON- could wish for
range_from chow mein to sweet and sour meat to fry_rice
-PRON- get all that carby goodness
-PRON- have really like the honey_garlic chicken so_far
though -PRON- do suggest ask for a little less sauce since -PRON- tend_to over do -PRON- and the sauce can get pretty sweet at time
-PRON- have also get the sweet and sour chicken and the curry_chicken
here be what -PRON- notice about hakka legend
anything -PRON- order -PRON- will come deep_fry
-PRON- be quite a surprise that the chicken piece in the curry be batter and deep_fry
-PRON- be a_bit weird at first and -PRON- would not choose conventional curry over -PRON- but -PRON- be interesting
what -PRON- like be with any amount_of sauce -PRON- can put on -PRON- deep_fry meat -PRON- never get soggy
there be always that great flavourful crunch
the number one reason -PRON- like about this_place be just how utterly fast the food come
and have to drive roughly 7 minute to get here and 7 minute back be great for -PRON-
fast service fast_food
-PRON- be always worth -PRON- to come_here
long day and the celebration have not even begin
-PRON- drop -PRON- bag off and go to the hotel for a drink and a bite to eat
the bartender be really friendly and check on -PRON- frequently
-PRON- order a bloody_mary and -PRON- be not to bad
for -PRON- meal -PRON- order the pittsburgh salad with salmon for $_18
-PRON- must_say this salad be huge -PRON- be load with egg salmon and fry
this be not bad for a hotel restaurant
update review
just try get -PRON- second order through groupon
find out -PRON- be out of mushroom
a pizza_joint out of mushroom
ugh needless_to_say
-PRON- doubt -PRON- will even use -PRON- second groupon
what a waste definitely will complain to groupon
first review
not_sure how this be get such a high_rating
go in with a groupon for -PRON- first_time try this_place
order a pizza with sausage and shroom and one with pepperoni and olive
bring -PRON- pizza home
find out -PRON- forget olive
-PRON- do_not feel_like drive all the way back
so -PRON- just eat the plain pepperoni
the pizza be overcook and the crust be so tough
-PRON- be like eat jerkey
-PRON- will give -PRON- another try since -PRON- have the remain groupon
hopefully -PRON- will be good
a friend and -PRON- stop_by to get a plant or two and a cute_little succulent
beautiful shop cover in bird cage -PRON- can_not miss -PRON-
the owner be a lovely kind lady_who advise -PRON- on which plant be good for -PRON-
-PRON- be super_cute
-PRON- even give -PRON- a couple flower for good_luck on -PRON- sunny sunday which be a generous gesture
will be go_back for sure
check -PRON- out
-PRON- perspective be from die hard New York giants_fan and all around bar fan
this bar be only one of two bar in_town that cater to ny giants_fan
as -PRON- read this review keep in mind that this be an_early game
but this be football season in_vegas
and -PRON- have be to bar for early game and -PRON- be as busy as if -PRON- be monday_night football
con
this_place be not advertize to the general public as a nygiants theme bar in the las_vegas area
-PRON- find out about this_place through a buddy of mine
the reason -PRON- can_not advertise as be a giants bar be because one of the criterion require by the las_vegas review journal be that -PRON- cater only to the team support and not show any_other game while -PRON- team be play
but -PRON- do -PRON- have every game on tv and -PRON- display the giants game on the big_screen with sound
this in and of itslef be not that big of a deal because there be a decent amount_of giants_fan in the place but there be also plenty_of fan_of other team too and that kind_of take_away_from the whole concept
-PRON- raffle prize at half time but -PRON- be freebie -PRON- get from vendor and none giants relate
the bartender wear a philidelphia eagles jersey every_week
smoking be allow and ventilation be definitely lacking
pros because -PRON- definitely a local place the price be right
the service be always excellent
the staff be welcome
the customer be friendly and the place be set_up pretty nicely
the menu be pretty_good
when -PRON- go to an_early game -PRON- have the stake and egg with hashbrown and choice of toast for $_9
-PRON- be absolutely excellent
well cooked and delicious
the beer always cold and on point
-PRON- would already have breakfast
so -PRON- just have the potato chip fry
these chip be very good
conclusion
as a bar -PRON- get four_star but -PRON- only go during football season to watch the giants when -PRON- not already on tv
so that be all -PRON- have to go by
-PRON- give the place three_star instead_of two as a giants bar because -PRON- be as close to a giants bar as any_other bar get in this town and begger can_not be chooser
-PRON- would give -PRON- four_star if -PRON- be a strickly giants bar and five if the bartender do_not wear an eagles jersey
if -PRON- be a football fan -PRON- understand
amazing customer_service with comfy bed and clean room in convenient location
-PRON- have stay in this hotel on 3 different occasion over the past_few_year and -PRON- plan to book again in the future
thank -PRON- for make -PRON- feel at home
bad breakfast -PRON- have ever have and -PRON- be expensive too
-PRON- will not recommend -PRON- to anyone_who expect a good chinese breakfast
friday_afternoon happy_hour and the place be
well -PRON- be not rockin
here for a co_worker 's farewell but if -PRON- be not for the b ball game on -PRON- large screen_tv -PRON- be half the patronage
-PRON- waitress be very_friendly actually and attentive always check up on -PRON- w\/out be pushy
food be 2_star mediocore
-PRON- be a bar but an_extra star grant for the sober shuttle
that be awesome
great special and atmosphere go on a brown sunday great crowd and staff be helpful
1st notice rivas when i see the sign out front for buy 1 get 1 chicken burrito "buy

today -PRON- have the good haircut of -PRON- life and -PRON- be all thank to bekah
-PRON- price be very_reasonable and -PRON- be so fun to talk to
-PRON- be patient and hard work and will dedicate -PRON- time to give -PRON- the perfect cut
-PRON- be so_excited to comeback to -PRON- soon
wow -PRON- can_not stress enough how happy -PRON- be to have find -PRON-
the salon be clean and cute and all the girl seem to know_what -PRON- be do
would_definitely_recommend to a friend
yummy

cholesterol y
what be not to love
background
-PRON- drive down indian school road all the time
and one day week_ago a bright yellow sign within a routinely ignore stripmall catch -PRON- eye as -PRON- near 9th st. navajo frybread
-PRON- beckon
-PRON- would then space out on the road and salivate at the thought of relinquish -PRON- to -PRON- siren call but then -PRON- would realize -PRON- actually have a destination to get to and would put -PRON- foot back on the accelerator
until the one day sacred hogan be -PRON- destination
boy -PRON- feel completely lame for hold out for so long give how close this_place be
but here go
the setting
locate_in a dinky nondescript strip_mall surprise the sign above the restaurant exclaim yaa'teeh which be a navajo greeting
upon_enter the restaurant -PRON- will see -PRON- be an extremely casual joint
nothing_fancy here
a_few booth on one side of the room
some table elsewhere
gumball and toy vend machine in one corner
a newspaper rack carry the navajo times in another
and in yet another a refrigerate drink section complete with shasta soda man -PRON- have not have shasta since -PRON- be 8
and of_course folk dining and totally be into the food
plus kick ass
hot_sauce on every table
-PRON- be like this
there be no bathroom from what -PRON- could see maybe -PRON- have to go_through the kitchen
other_than_that -PRON- be order at the counter
and then -PRON- will bring -PRON- -PRON- grub
and as for what await at the counter the menu
first_off a quick backstory on navajo frybread which -PRON- rediscover while research the history of the hogan
in 1864 around 8,000 navajos have -PRON- land seize and crop destroy and be send on the long walk to fort sumner new mexico where -PRON- be keep in captivity for 4 year
-PRON- be give meager and sometimes rancid food commodity by the federal government and through what -PRON- have with white flour salt and lard frybread be create
from the personal account -PRON- have read frybread now hold a special place for many navajo and native of other tribe and be to be consume until the earth be once_again purify
quite a heavy history for something so simple but for what -PRON- be worth -PRON- be pretty delicious and filling
there be quite a_few option on the menu
-PRON- could get a full navajo taco for $ 7.49 or thereabout and 1\/2 taco for $ 5.49 or so
-PRON- have red and green chili beef taco among many_other sweet fry bread dust with sugar and other optional goody blue corn mush with cedar ash mutton stew and more
-PRON- opt to just have a 1\/2 red chili taco to start with since -PRON- have be make one too_many gluttonous choice lately
verdict
-PRON- like -PRON- taco
-PRON- think part of -PRON- be the familiarity
american indian frybread seem almost identical to indian indian frybread the venerable puri and bhatura so the taste of frybread be once and always familiar to -PRON-
not_sure if that be a good thing for -PRON- heart or -PRON- gut
never mind
-PRON- already answer that in -PRON- head
the rest_of the taco be tasty too
the red chili beef be good although the dash of hot_sauce definitely help give -PRON- a need kick
diced red_onion tomato and shred lettuce help complete the package -PRON- leave out the cheese just in case -PRON- stomach decide to be reactionary that day
-PRON- be go to have to check -PRON- other specialty at some point
-PRON- be especially curious about the blue corn mush with ash and indulge in a sweet dessert frybread once -PRON- can fit in -PRON- work slack again from 3 month_ago
tight pant suck
how be it compare to fry bread house
do the navajo and the o'odham have different way of make fry bread
-PRON- have not go to fry bread house in a long_time so -PRON- be not_sure
-PRON- will defer to cher for the expert 's opinion
but -PRON- stomach be completely fine after eat_here so maybe the fry bread house use more milk powder in -PRON- recipe
although the recipe for frybread seem pretty simple so maybe -PRON- be the way the bread be knead and what -PRON- be fry in
do_not_know
final word
while sacred hogan 's frybread will not be part of -PRON- daily dietary intake -PRON- could be a great occasional treat
a nice new addition to the neighborhood and open on sunday to boot which be a bonus for a city where practically 70 of non chain restaurant take the day off
and yelp
add native american as a restaurant category 4_star
soooooo what can i say ive be here about 4 time total and this last_visit be very_disappointing and i be be generous
the place usually fill_up quickly and if -PRON- want to make_reservation make_sure -PRON- two week
-PRON- be advance
there be five of -PRON- for a friend 's bday and i get there nice and early and be serve a drink almost immediately
but when -PRON- friend arrive every course take a half_hour or more include -PRON- drink
-PRON- order off the tapas menu and then portion would not even satiate a ant
food be good do_not get -PRON- wrong but the service be excruciating and when the staff finally acknowledge -PRON- existence -PRON- cancel -PRON- drink order and get the hell out of there
moral of the story do_not go with a group_of 4 or more people
3
1\/2_star love the atmosphere
-PRON- sit_at the bar first and have a cocktail to get start although this seem to have be frown upon because -PRON- be get the look to sit and eat
nevertheless -PRON- sit in time of -PRON- reservation and enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- have start with the cheese plate and scallop with chorizo carrot and a maple butter
the cheese plate be lack and not -PRON- favorite cheese plate in_town
however the scallop be really well_prepared -PRON- be cook just right and the flavor be great
for -PRON- entree -PRON- have the halibut with lobster and lobster butter with asparagus
-PRON- be cook good and -PRON- eat everything on -PRON- plate but -PRON- just feel_like -PRON- be miss some flavor
-PRON- friends also have the halibut and the wahoo special which be over cook but tasty
all in all this be a good meal the server be great ty and suggest great wine
-PRON- would come again and get that scallop
-PRON- just be not wowed

parking be good o side the plaza
-PRON- make_an_appointment for 8:30 p.m. and -PRON- party arrive exactly on time
the staff sit -PRON- party at some random table without even acknowledge -PRON- about when -PRON- main table would be ready
this restaurant have a well know name and -PRON- be extremely upset and shock that the service be beyond poor
the service at a non fine_dining restaurant have good service
thumb down
and yes -PRON- be still wait as -PRON- be write this review
-PRON- have be 30_minute late so_far
shame
-PRON- give 4_star for the fast and courteous service
3star for the food -PRON- feel the portion_size be good the freshness of the veggie great but the flavor be lack a little
-PRON- will go_back because -PRON- can_not resist a well cook chicken and broccoli maybe -PRON- will be exceptional the next_time
if not -PRON- will still have some perfectly steam broccoli floret lol
if -PRON- do_not try bang bang -PRON- do_not_know_how good a cup or a waffle full of ice_cream can taste
yes the wait be long expect a good 20_minute spend here
-PRON- would suggest come with a group_of friend to make the wait a_little_bit bearable

janine be a treasure
-PRON- make_sure -PRON- appointment be make be always welcome and remember detail from conversation six month in the past
meanwhile here -PRON- be struggle to remember what -PRON- tell -PRON- husband five_minute ago
-PRON- can_not speak to dental work beyond clean an x_ray search for lot_of wood to knock but -PRON- have never leave feeling like a shoddy job be do
like -PRON- say the cleaning be so good that -PRON- usually contemplate not eat for a while after
that never stick but still
the inside be not go to be ultra lux or modern

-PRON- can honestly say the cod be probably one of the good fish -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- be cook_perfectly

-PRON- feel very light and refreshing
the lemony couscous be a perfect complement
-PRON- do drink a lot and the bill be quite expensive

-PRON- also offer a takeaway service which be really popular be -PRON- be din in the restaurant and have taste -PRON- food
-PRON- can see why
the only_downside which -PRON- could see be that the people_who be order takeaway be wait a long_time for -PRON- food but -PRON- be a busy friday_night
so -PRON- be probably to be expect
-PRON- will_definitely be back at morningside spice for another curry soon -PRON- love -PRON-
original hawaiian poke be here in_las_vegas now
-PRON- ahi katsu from the family recipe be something that -PRON- unheard of before and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- favorite be the spicy_tuna poke crunch with brown_rice
paina cafe have a convenient access from spring mountain and have more variety_of healthy option than any_other poke restaurant
-PRON- have already become a regular visiting for -PRON- healthy option at lease 2_3 time a week
-PRON- would have give this_place an_excellent review but then one person have to ruin -PRON-
the waiter ask -PRON- what -PRON- tip be go to be
as a hospitality management major -PRON- be absolutely appal that -PRON- ask -PRON- this
-PRON- never ask what -PRON- tip be go to be
at that point -PRON- do_not_care that the food be good or the drink
-PRON- give 2_star for the food but due_to the service -PRON- receive -PRON- could_not give -PRON- anymore
-PRON- will not be return to this_establishment
cute_little shop on saint laurent
-PRON- have only try the pasteis de nata here and -PRON- be delicious
this_place have really go downhill
-PRON- sushi use to be so so now -PRON- be terrible
-PRON- try the salmon eggs fresh water eel miso_soup and crusty crab roll
all of the food -PRON- eat be bad
-PRON- be just consistently bad bad sushi -PRON- have have
-PRON- would not recommend_this_place to anyone
if -PRON- be look for something authentic something that resemble a home cook chinese meal in montreal then -PRON- highly_recommend -PRON- to check this_place out
petit and unpretentious this restaurant offer an experience that be increasingly become rare in a word where -PRON- be pay for the decir rather_than the food
now mind -PRON- -PRON- be not say this be a zagat\/michelin restaurant masquerade as a hole_in the wall
yet for those of who long for a humble meal cook with care and reminiscent of a meal in a typical chinese home this be -PRON-
the wait staff be friendly hardwork folk try to do -PRON- good
the ambience be simple a good place to have a meal and catch_up with friend and family unhindered
all in all a throwback to simple time
-PRON- stay_here for a couple week while -PRON- be look for a place
the staff be great always warm and welcome
the lobby have refreshment and fruit
the place have wash machine and dryer
-PRON- even give -PRON- free detergent if -PRON- do_not have any
the room be nice with a bed and couch fridge dishwasher and microwave
-PRON- be new and clean
anyone need to an extended stay hotel should check this_place out
hilton do -PRON- right
-PRON- do_not_know when -PRON- will be back but -PRON- do know -PRON- will tell everyone -PRON- come in contact with where to go
do -PRON- mention how great the staff be
nice place and great people
-PRON- be really look_forward_to a return trip to bouchon since -PRON- have have -PRON- amazing scramble_egg pretty_much when -PRON- first open
such rich and creamy soft curd
-PRON- finally drag the bf here hype the scramble_egg
-PRON- sit_down -PRON- look_at the next table and -PRON- know -PRON- be in trouble
egads
not the soft scramble_egg of -PRON- dream but instead the regular steam tray kind_of scramble_egg -PRON- can get anywhere
-PRON- ask the waitress if -PRON- could do soft scramble_egg and -PRON- say no_problem
-PRON- come_out and disappointment
a slightly good version_of diner egg
-PRON- think a place that charge_$ 22 for -PRON- version_of an american breakfast would at_least sous vide the egg if -PRON- do_not want to do -PRON- to order
the banana nut muffin be good the chocolate almond croissant dry out
how do -PRON- dry out something that have butter everywhere
sorry tk this_place be a sell out
diner 7 be relatively new small diner that have open up just near the shore in leith
-PRON- specialise in burger and have good selection
-PRON- come with chip and salad great traditional chip
-PRON- be not a huge menu
but -PRON- think this work well
-PRON- have the steak and onion baguette nice thinly slice steak and crispy onion
the decor be very american diner red booth and formica table
always have interesting pic on the wall too
this be not a posh place -PRON- be a lovely relaxed friendly place and very reasonably_price too
this_place be great
-PRON- be in_town for 48 hour and need to shoot some footage for a_few hour
4_star for service take one off for how expensive -PRON- be which probably have to do with the fact_that -PRON- do_not do half day rental
anyway definitely_worth hit -PRON- up
when a group_of friend and -PRON- look for a place to go to dinner -PRON- always suggest go here
-PRON- accommodate large_group very well
the wait be never too_long and -PRON- have a nice area in the hotel next_door to comfortable wait
the food selection be good but nothing ever stick with -PRON-
-PRON- can never find something to eat -PRON- really love but -PRON- do suggest the horchata because -PRON- be delicious
some really good coffee sometimes the batista 's can be a little off put
but -PRON- mean well -PRON- just the vibe there
every one tr yin really hard to be all cool hip and shit but regardless the coffee good most the people be pretty rad and the food decent
can_not really go_wrong_with this spot probably one of the good coffee house in downtown_phoenix if not the good
update- order a hot chai latte about a week_ago and receive -PRON- ice cold
-PRON- ask for -PRON- to be heated and be tell no
customer come first and -PRON- have be a pay one for over 3_year
-PRON- understand -PRON- want to be trendy and all hipster or what not but come on
-PRON- do_not_know_what happen to all the cool
batista 's -PRON- guy use to have
hopefully -PRON- will bring -PRON- back and get_rid_of the lameo currently work there
-PRON- be really nervous to come_here base_on the review that -PRON- have read -PRON- be either really good or really bad so -PRON- be not exactly sure what to expect
-PRON- must_say -PRON- be so_glad that -PRON- decide to go here last_night for dinner
everything be perfect
from the wine all the way to the weather
-PRON- server be absolutely great
-PRON- keep come_back every few_minute to check on -PRON- and make_sure that -PRON- have everyt if -PRON- need
-PRON- be in no hurry and be just enjoy the gorgeous sunset and sip on drink

-PRON- think -PRON- be slightly pricy but overall not_too_bad
ps if -PRON- get fry the sweet_potato one -PRON- like much good_than the regular one
if -PRON- can make -PRON- in time to watch the sunset over the water -PRON- be absolutely awesome
once -PRON- be dark the little lantern type light -PRON- have come on along_with light string along the railing and above the patio and give -PRON- blanket to use if -PRON- be cold
inside -PRON- have a one man jazz band playing music so -PRON- can_not go_wrong whether -PRON- sit inside or outside
-PRON- will_definitely be back
this caribou location be by_far -PRON- favorite location
-PRON- take full advantage of -PRON- free wi fi pretty_much every weekend
-PRON- love the coziness of caribou especially in the winter when -PRON- have the fireplace on
the temperature tend_to be a_bit chilly inside during the winter
so -PRON- would dress warm
this_location tend_to get busy during the breakfast lunch and dinner rush time
so -PRON- may have to wait a few_minute for a table but this rarely have happen in the few_year -PRON- have be go there
if -PRON- be look for a nice quiet place to work or a place to meet some friend for coffee -PRON- would give this caribou location a try

-PRON- would not recommend nail fanatic at all nail craft be below standard as see in -PRON- picture of different size acrylic on -PRON- nail -PRON- nail break off the next_day because all -PRON- nail have crack across the middle_of -PRON- and -PRON- be a total waste of $_75
and -PRON- be go to be charge to fix the error on -PRON- nail which be not -PRON- fault to begin with
this shop do_not have any pedicure chair all pedicure be do in a diy walmart foot spa at a min $_50 charge the shop do_not have any comfortable seat a old futon bed be the only option for sit which be very uncomfortable
nor be there any nail_salon chair while get -PRON- nail do very uncomfortable seating)it be a very limit nail shop more like something -PRON- would see 20 year_ago or when -PRON- go to someone 's house to get -PRON- nail do
-PRON- be a very low end nail shop with over charge pricing lettering be $_5 a letter so to write -PRON- name would cost $_30
extra no walk_in welcome as_well_as a $_35 membership fee to everyone
price_range be between $ 75- $ 350 for nail extremely expensive
two_star be for the food not the service
this restaurant be super expensive when -PRON- first open but then change to a buffet instead which be really nice
the food be fresh
the hotpot -PRON- be flavorless but -PRON- can get all the spice -PRON- need
now onto the freaking service
-PRON- hate din here
only_reason -PRON- still go be because this be the only hotpot place near pitt
every_time -PRON- come_here -PRON- do_not feel respected
the waiter and waitress have a habit of serve americans first
-PRON- remember one time vividly when -PRON- table need water while not one but two waitress be at an american 's table chat with -PRON- and make_sure -PRON- be comfortable as_well_as teach -PRON- how to eat
this always happen
there be so_many time when the waiter\/waitress ask if the americans table be ok with everything and just walk_away without check in on -PRON-
-PRON- hate discrimination especially come from -PRON- own race
other_than_that the waiter be also not efficient enough
-PRON- be always slow on -PRON- task and lose -PRON- order once and tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not place -PRON-
-PRON- have to write on the menu paper
so of_course -PRON- know -PRON- place -PRON-
-PRON- do_not seem to care if -PRON- be wait or not -PRON- do thing at -PRON- own_pace
all in all -PRON- do_not come_here anymore after a couple of time
-PRON- hate be treat like sh*t by people of -PRON- own race
edit
there be another time -PRON- go there when -PRON- parent come for the graduation
-PRON- be chinese and can_not speak_english very well
since -PRON- be a chinese_restaurant -PRON- dad be try to see if -PRON- have the chinese beer -PRON- like
the waiter have such a nasty attitude
-PRON- should not treat people like this
-PRON- be pretty_sure these asian americans have family speak break english
-PRON- should have be more understanding
not to mention -PRON- should not be rude to -PRON- customer in the first place
meet a client there around 7:00 pm
-PRON- be not expect much from rt but -PRON- sure do_not make much effort to please
-PRON- be tell that get drink would take a_bit longer because there be only bartender which be totally acceptable but apparently -PRON- server mean to say -PRON- bar do_not actually have anything
-PRON- server come_back from the bar a half_dozen time claim that -PRON- be out of whatev -PRON- party of three have order
lagunita
do_not have -PRON-
yuengling
do_not have -PRON-
bottled domestic

-PRON- ask what the sam adams seasonal draft be and -PRON- say -PRON- be sam adams
when -PRON- ask -PRON- to clarify which sam adams -PRON- just say -PRON- be sam adams apparently not understand what seasonal mean
oh and -PRON- do_not have that either
the salad_bar have some good offering and seem clean and well stock
the vegetarian in -PRON- group order a simple grill_cheese and be inform that -PRON- kitchen can_not make that
while -PRON- understand that order off the menu be not always an option -PRON- be talk_about two slice of cheese between toast bread
the fry that come with -PRON- dinner be so heavily salt that -PRON- have to brush -PRON- off by hand
the server be nice enough but -PRON- obviously do_not_know anything about the menu or bar offering
with -PRON- extremely limited food and drink selection -PRON- be hard to justify ever come_back
what a great place
-PRON- have great deal on tire and repair service not only that but the people here be extremely nice and have go_above and beyond what be expect
thank for always keep -PRON- car in tip top shape
definitely will be back and will be recommend_this_place to friend and family
suya suya

i can_not say no more
u may as_well just go try -PRON- for yoself
-PRON- have lunch here for the first_time earlier today and the food be amazing
-PRON- husband have the chef salad and -PRON- say -PRON- be the good chef salad -PRON- be have ever
-PRON- have the crepe w\/ shrimp and mushroom and -PRON- be excellent
the service be great
-PRON- be so_excited that this be in -PRON- hood
-PRON- would pick this any day over a chain restaurant
the scottsdale rd jalapeño inferno use to be -PRON- favorite mexican_restaurant and -PRON- have recommend -PRON- to many friend
not any more
thing have change and both -PRON- and friend have notice
some of -PRON- concern happy_hour and where -PRON- apply use to be the entire restaurant and patio now only the bar and bar patio area which adjoin the restaurant patio
-PRON- have a party of 6 seat on the patio next to the bar patio be not aware of the changed happy_hour and be refuse happy_hour price
rather_than pick everything up and move -PRON- leave and go to another restaurant
on a recent previous occasion -PRON- be serve food that have be under the heat lamp too_long and a waitress that be less_than friendly
something have change at this ji and not for the good
-PRON- bf and -PRON- wander in here to enjoy a beer and kill a half_hour before a movie a few_week_ago
-PRON- would sum this_place up in one word charming
-PRON- sit out on the patio because there be two decent musician do acoustic cover
the bartender be attentive and knowledgeable_about the beer_selection
-PRON- be impressed_by the friendly_staff cleanliness and overall charm of this english\/irish restaurant 's decor
-PRON- intention be just to have a drink and then the crazy thing happen the large_group at a neighboring table be serve some of the most delicious look food -PRON- have ever see and suddenly -PRON- just had to see a menu
-PRON- sit there minute_before -PRON- leave to go to the movie openly gawk at these_people 's food
-PRON- be talk juicy steak garlic potato sauteed garden veggie and succulent sausage
-PRON- have already eat dinner and yet -PRON- be practically drool because that food look and smell so good
after the movie -PRON- could_not resist but return to try the fare
-PRON- be a sucker for a good fish fry so -PRON- split the walleye and fry with an add side of sauteed summer squash
the portion be large the taste be amazing and the veggie be as good as -PRON- look
-PRON- could_not help but try the bread_pudding -PRON- be smite
this_place be not cheap if -PRON- be less expensive -PRON- would have probably be back several_time
drinks dinner and dessert for two add up quickly
however -PRON- be the kind_of place -PRON- would take a guest from out of town or celebrate a special_occasion
or -PRON- be a great choice if -PRON- know someone_else be go to pick_up the check
-PRON- be definitely a good value though
-PRON- look_forward_to -PRON- next_visit
-PRON- love the atmosphere here
-PRON- love the hipster barista and -PRON- ability to listen to what -PRON- like and make a drink perfect for -PRON-
this cafe be always open
-PRON- serve really good food
the soup be delicious
be careful because -PRON- ask for a grill_cheese sandwich which be not on the menu
-PRON- come_out to be a whooping $_10 buck
be this a price -PRON- just make up and throw at the customer when -PRON- ask for something that be not on the menu
-PRON- advise -PRON- to just order what s on menu because if -PRON- do_not -PRON- will have a surprise on -PRON- bill
-PRON- recently return to wicked_spoon for the second_time
while overall -PRON- be still pretty_darn good -PRON- be not quite as mind_blow as the first_visit
the space -PRON- be still beautiful and clean and the sevice be great
-PRON- server be super attentive make_sure -PRON- drink be constantly refill and -PRON- used plate collect
the food -PRON- just be not as up to par as the last_time
the brisket that have be heavenly before be bland and ice cold this time
maybe -PRON- be because the restaurant be not as pack that the brisket sit under the lamp for a long_time
who know
all -PRON- know be -PRON- have one cold bland bite and push -PRON- aside
-PRON- decide to give the fry_chicken a whirl
-PRON- can see why -PRON- be so popular
the season on the skin be really delicious
but when -PRON- go to eat a second leg -PRON- find a long hair fry into the skin
ummm gross
so
yeah do_not eat anymore of that
finally the wicked juice -PRON- have last_time have change
before -PRON- be a sort_of watermelon light nectar that be incredible and mix perfectly with champagne to create a different refresh mimosa
this time -PRON- be a heavy almost smoothie like thick strawberryish juice
when -PRON- try to mix -PRON- with the champ the entire drink would bubble over
-PRON- try to very slowly pour the juice into a half empty champagne glass the second round to control for the extra fizzing but again -PRON- bubble over
-PRON- think the smoothie like consistency of the wicked juice just do_not work with the champagne
-PRON- be sadden the heavenly juice -PRON- have before be go
but -PRON- be not all a loss
-PRON- enjoy the angry mac and cheese and the garlic foccacia bread
both be satisfyingly delicious
-PRON- gelato and cookie be also quite good
so -PRON- be hop -PRON- be just have an off day with some of the food
-PRON- first_visit be incredible enough that -PRON- will return once more and give -PRON- one more shot
bistro 19 be a quaint upscale modern\/classic setting
listed below be what -PRON- have and comment abut each one
-PRON- husband and -PRON- split the carpaccio appetizer = fabulous
-PRON- have the beet_salad = fabulous -PRON- split the sea_bass with -PRON- sister in law
and -PRON- be the best sea_bass -PRON- have have
-PRON- cook see bass frequently and never have -PRON- be this good
-PRON- ask -PRON- and -PRON- generously share how the prepare -PRON-
-PRON- freely share everything -PRON- ask about which be very_nice
-PRON- husband have the almond chicken serve over risotto = fabulous
service be excellent
if -PRON- be in the area this restaurant be a must
-PRON- be a huge_fan_of the fast fire pizza concept and blaze have just become -PRON- new_favorite spot
first -PRON- be just down the road from -PRON- house
second blaze be the new good in class for this restaurant concept
the crust be really what make blaze better_than pieology
-PRON- be just good thick have a real crust good taste
the topping be fresh and -PRON- be add all -PRON- want type_of deal
-PRON- love the bbq pizza with pineapple and red_pepper add
the white sauce pizza be awesome too
if -PRON- like pizza do_not -PRON- all then -PRON- will absolutely_love blaze
well -PRON- may be bias
but -PRON- have be here for over 3_year now
-PRON- can argue that other fitness club may have more business focus clientele and here be liberal hipster and student look crowd but aura fitness have one of the good facility in the city and -PRON- be spacious
there be lot_of hype about lori 's electric yoga
well lori be a great trainer and enthusiastic instructor who will always push -PRON- harder
be train in a very traditional way -PRON- find the class more like strength training than yoga
what -PRON- like the most be the tuesday evening
robert 's candle night yoga which truly relax -PRON- every_time and -PRON- be also challenge enough to allow -PRON- to move at -PRON- own_pace
-PRON- have a_bit of ankle problem from an_accident and -PRON- dance regularly so -PRON- need to be ultra careful about -PRON- past injury
in robert 's class -PRON- be worry free
-PRON- be so experienced and methodological
-PRON- actually do -PRON- head down pose for the first_time in -PRON- class without even noticing which be impossible in other class
if -PRON- love music and dance kurtis contemporary stretch class on saturday be also great for someone_who just wanna get start with a_little_bit of dance move
also there be many many great class in the club
and -PRON- think -PRON- be worthy a try
this be strictly a happy_hour review
first let -PRON- be honest
-PRON- be day drinking
happy_hour start at 5 and -PRON- pull_up at 5:01
hey -PRON- be thirsty
-PRON- meet a girlfriend for a couple of drink and a snack
-PRON- hit the wine_list and there be something a little wacky about garlic shots wine_list
-PRON- only hear_about -PRON-
but -PRON- have never see -PRON-
weird
-PRON- talk_about -PRON- and hand -PRON- the happy_hour menu that offer the house wine for $_5 and that be -PRON- favorite price
but g&s do_not have any house wine so the bartender offer to substitute
great -PRON- will take a substitute
so wine in hand mad gossip commence until bartender 's boyfriend or last_night 's last call show_up
-PRON- do_not_know which but -PRON- exchange pleasantry about the previous night
-PRON- could have do without this conversation but -PRON- do explain the bandana the bartender be wear as a skirt and the open sweater with expose black bra
-PRON- expect this outfit at a strip club not the bar 500 foot from -PRON- kid 's school
with this outfit even -PRON- think about throw quarter on the floor to see if -PRON- would bend over
anyhoo cattiness aide the bartender do check in on -PRON- on ocassion and that house wine never do show
unfortunately neither do the $_5 price
-PRON- substitute set -PRON- back $_9 a glass
ouch
-PRON- get a $_2 discount
would -PRON- go_back
-PRON- girlfriend be bent -PRON- want a lady_who day drink experience and that be not what g&s be deliver
but -PRON- love the mussel appetizer so -PRON- may find -PRON- in the corner scarf these down but g&s clean up -PRON- wine_list and staff
if -PRON- do_not have -PRON- take -PRON- off get a dress code for staff and keep the mingling with friend a little more subtle
what -PRON- be look_at be a train wreck
so what be the deal with -PRON- g&s
who be -PRON- and who be -PRON- clientele
do -PRON- want the 40 plus crowd with -PRON- pricey house value and mid price bmws for dinner and drink or -PRON- go for the apartment crew who be hit the bar late and skip dinner and match each_other shot for shot
-PRON- ask because -PRON- do_not_know who -PRON- be try to appeal to
-PRON- think if -PRON- figure this out thing will work out for -PRON-
-PRON- find pretty in ink through yelp
-PRON- be research microblad salon
-PRON- have tattooed brow previously and most of the place -PRON- be look_at want -PRON- to have tattoo removal do prior to microblading
tia respond quickly and ask -PRON- to come in to see -PRON- brow
-PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- option be and -PRON- set an_appt
tia be very conscience and thorough with -PRON- work
-PRON- take the time to explain and answer_any_question -PRON- have
-PRON- go for -PRON- follow_up and -PRON- be the same no issue just great result
-PRON- highly_recommend tia
-PRON- have go to provider and have not do -PRON- homework in the past
this be not the case with tia
-PRON- be worth_every_penny
-PRON- get what -PRON- pay for do_not be fool by the cheap option out there these be -PRON- eyebrow
and -PRON- want to make_sure -PRON- experience be safe and -PRON- result be the good
tia will make_sure -PRON- have both
book now because -PRON- fill_up really fast
la qualité de_la viande laisse à
désirer
des brûlur de glace sur_la viande a fondu
le bouillon manque de gout
vous pouvez trouver mieux pour
du pho
-PRON- like that this_place be open till 10 so i can tan after i get off work
-PRON- convenient location and hour make this the place i choose to tan at
this_place seem clean and the girl behind the counter be pleasant
come by late evening around 8:30_pm on a friday
there be a small lineup to order
service be slow
seem_like -PRON- be have some difficulty keep up because of the order come in through uber eats
the food -PRON- be very good
-PRON- order a whole chicken to go
price there be very_reasonable
from what -PRON- can see -PRON- be very_generous with -PRON- portion_size
everybody 's plate seem to be overflow
the place be very clean and new
there be seat inside and outside
-PRON- definitely can_not go_wrong_with this_place
give -PRON- a try
-PRON- will not regret -PRON-
do_not be surprised if there be a lineup because -PRON- be so good
-PRON- have be come to vegas for just over a year and everyone say yah get to stop here
-PRON- be sorry but -PRON- be chicken fingers\/strip
-PRON- be good but really
chicken strip
customer_service be amazing and the dipping_sauce be like fry sauce only good
-PRON- would stop here instead_of another chicken place except popeyes or fast_food in a heart beat but will not make -PRON- a goal
sorry guy
not a nut for chicken strip
no_matter how good and these be just that good
side_note
coleslaw be acceptable but the kernel have good
the fry be limp and lifeless texas toast warm and tasty
there be be quite a stir of brazilian steakhouse as of late
-PRON- mom in particular have be spend quite an insane amount_of money here take -PRON- all -PRON- friend and more recently -PRON- monster meat eat brother visit from nyc
-PRON- actually wonder_if upon bring -PRON- brother here a buffet would finally cut -PRON- off
-PRON- metabolism and appetite make -PRON- want to enroll -PRON- in one of those japanese eat contest kid -PRON- not
so first_off what do -PRON- order
well -PRON- have two option really pay_$ 25 for the salad_bar or $_30 for the salad_bar and unlimited meat
the first_time -PRON- come_here the salad_bar remind -PRON- of the typical kind_of tapas item -PRON- use in cater to large parties\/event
high_quality cheese fantastic manchego chickpea salad asparagus the whole basil mozz thing high_quality pasta salad and tropical fruit mango smoke salmon
mussels-- remind -PRON- quite like scandinavia kaldbord --cold board
there be a relatively high profit margin in buy these thing and ppl always leave happy
consider luxury to nordic farmer or southerners
but as someone_who opt_for only the salad_bar -PRON- have to say $_25 be a bit_overpriced
the wine_list however be fantastic
-PRON- have an italian pinot and normally woulda be quite satisfied with good cheese wine and mussel but the mussel
the seafood available be ok after live in scandinavia -PRON- be hard to impress but the mussel at the buffet be terribly overcook
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to make a fresh batch since -PRON- be the only hot meat part of the salad_bar
the result be a somewhat discolour un fresh grey version_of the previous batch of mussel
cie la vie
one nice thing -PRON- do however be also bring_out hot little brazilian dish like baked cheese bread ball fabulous and fry polenta also fabulous
as for the meat
there be a good variety from sirloin steak garlic steak chicken sausage lamb spicy chicken mainly
most of the meat be cook very well but there be an occasional bout of meat that be overcook to death or undercooked and bleedin thru the ear
on the other_hand -PRON- must have be hard to constantly keep up with the ferocious appetite of -PRON- brother
let -PRON- make an injunction here and say the service be truly impeccable
the owner in -PRON- sporty jumpsuit literally come_out with a doner in hand to ensure -PRON- be get every bit of meat -PRON- want
when -PRON- brother ask for more sirloin -PRON- be like the apocalypse have break out-- the owner the head chef the waiter go into a mad rush
-PRON- server antonio come over multiple_time make -PRON- everything be good
but not in an annoying american sort_of way a genuine relaxed and helpful sort_of way
-PRON- mother leave here with smile understandably
the quality of the buffet be good
-PRON- be a_bit jaded think again that -PRON- be make donkeyload of money
purely base_on the overpriced salad_bar to -PRON- rice bean some nice pasta salad do_not warrant $_25 so -PRON- would not come_back here -PRON- also have a slight ethical problem with encourage unlimited mass consumption of meat maybe why -PRON- appeal to americans as for -PRON- family_member -PRON- be sure -PRON- will become regular

lovely happy_hour oyster and a nice glass of prosecco in a wonderful french atmosphere
a wonderful way to start -PRON- evening dining
worst

-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be on auto play or there be just a bunch_of folk with terrible middle_aged music syndrome but even -PRON- folk have good taste and -PRON- be 60-something
-PRON- have get to have some_sort_of filter on this to guarantee decent tune

the star of the dish be the rib
perfectly smoke and then flash grill
excellent
the bean and garlic_bread be -PRON- least favorite and too -PRON- lack flavor

with that say -PRON- be more forgiving and do_not necessarily have too high_expectation of mass produce filipino cooking
to celebrate -PRON- sister birthday -PRON- husband think -PRON- would be perfect to try dt 's kamayan night as -PRON- just recently come home from a trip back home to cebu and fondly recall -PRON- experience at one of the restaurant there with a similar set_up to eat with -PRON- hand and celebrate with -PRON- family

-PRON- be so tough to the point -PRON- be inedible
the halo halo be a complete disappointment as_well -PRON- be mostly ice with barely_any ingredient
-PRON- be so turn_off that -PRON- do_not bother take a lot_of pic lol
with all of the other option around -PRON- would not bother come_back
-PRON- would_rather spend -PRON- money somewhere_else and for the fraction of the $ 139.99 for just the food package minus drink and dessert
-PRON- could make a good feast at home
the only redeeming factor be -PRON- waitress -PRON- be bubbly and funny
be here a_few time and the food be always amazing
super_fast service as_well
-PRON- love -PRON-
what a terrible restaurant
this be literally the first_time -PRON- complain a restaurant on_yelp

there be very tiny and not fresh shrimp instead
more_importantly -PRON- even do_not taste good
the rice be only a bite
dinner at wicked_spoon for $ 35\/pp
so -PRON- confirm dinner time do have bone_marrow
there be stack of bone_marrow next to the meat stand
-PRON- look_like hunt go wild
here be some hit and miss
bone_marrow great
could be more roasted but these bone have so_much marrow
-PRON- be huge
prime_rib ok
-PRON- strongly recommend if -PRON- like medium_rare go_ahead ask -PRON- for a rare piece
-PRON- take request
mussel make to order red_sauce be good_than green sauce
ceviche a shot or two be great
-PRON- be fresh and very_tasty
pig ear -PRON- really like the flavoring
too_bad -PRON- be so salty
-PRON- have to get a pack of white_rice to finish eat -PRON-
but -PRON- be the good part of the pig ear and -PRON- sprinkle heavily some salt and pepper seasoning
shrimp tempura sushi -PRON- be ok
the shrimp tempura be no long crunchy
water melon tequila shot
so surprised to find this out in the open
what if kid pick -PRON- up
-PRON- be like a soju shoot
sweet from watermelon and a_little_bit of tequila trailing at the end
most of the alcohol have sink to the bottom so -PRON- may chose to stir before drink
cream of mushroom -PRON- can pass
not that great
shrimp n grit tasty but drop in score after -PRON- taste the american fish dish
braised rib -PRON- can pass
-PRON- be a little tough
fish and chips great presentation
but fish batter be a little thick
pappardelle looked dry but surprisingly fresh pasta tasting
-PRON- would choose this over -PRON- spaghetti choice
pistachio gelato soooooooooooooo good
soooooooooooo yummy
carmel candy gelato also good
mango raspberry gelato good
but -PRON- personally like fruit gelato flavor
tiramisu cake adorable cup
not much espresso flavor but the cream part be so light and fluffy
-PRON- be very worthy of a lick
fresh brownie in caramel sauce -PRON- can pass this one
fresh bake and out of the oven be good but by the time -PRON- get to -PRON- table -PRON- be probably already cold
fresh marshmellow soft and lightly sweet
one piece be enough for the palate
oh this buffet be so fun
especially when most dish be individually plat
-PRON- just look so_much more appetizing when thing be not stack in one tray
maybe someday -PRON- yelp_review will change
hopefully management will make some change
-PRON- would have give -PRON- five_star if -PRON- be not for the ridiculous policy
-PRON- be -PRON- second_time at this venue
the first_time be the foster the people concert and the second be morrissey the frontman of the 80 band the smiths
-PRON- usually collect -PRON- ticket stub but unfortunately -PRON- have a paper ticket that be give to -PRON- by -PRON- friend since -PRON- buy the ticket online
-PRON- usually cut -PRON- out and then put -PRON- in -PRON- collection of ticket stub book
after -PRON- scan -PRON- stub the employee take -PRON- only souvenir copy
-PRON- understand -PRON- have to collect -PRON- for accounting purpose but other venue do_not do that
once -PRON- have scan the ticket -PRON- usually give -PRON- back whether -PRON- be cardstock ticket stub or the one -PRON- print online
-PRON- mean -PRON- do_not collect the one -PRON- have scan on -PRON- phone or the one that get mail to -PRON- home
why collect the one -PRON- get print
maybe someday -PRON- will change -PRON- archaic guideline because -PRON- be stupid
-PRON- be go to throw -PRON- all away anyway
update 11\/27\/2017
meh
management have respond to -PRON- review
perhaps maybe the venue should upgrade the system
the business claim there be no way -PRON- can tell if ticket be multiple_time
well be not that why -PRON- have to scan -PRON- and if there be numerous ticket print -PRON- could avoid fraud
-PRON- could say the same_thing about hard perforated stub ticket
anyone could make a copy of that but as long as -PRON- be be scan
the stub can be return to the ticket holder
-PRON- should be the same for paper copy
-PRON- claim this standard policy be the same as any_other venue
sorry but -PRON- have attend many concert in different arena and venue
-PRON- do_not have the same policy
-PRON- go to a concert in another country with a paper ticket and -PRON- give -PRON- the copy
maybe this venue should update -PRON- scanning equipment because -PRON- be old and outdated
super fresh and super_friendly family business
-PRON- have the peach black tea and taro tea and several different donut
be a real treat
mmmm

after go to black dog a_few time -PRON- really do_not have the heart or desire to try any new bbq place

-PRON- like the one in kierland and would_recommend check -PRON- out
-PRON- be not -PRON- favoriate sushi in az but if -PRON- be in a pinch -PRON- will work
what -PRON- do_not like be that the outside table will fill_up for sport game on tv and the people continue to lurk and refuse to give up table
granted -PRON- be a game but the sushi place be not a sport_bar
-PRON- should require the people to order so_many drink or some much food every hour to maintain the table
that be -PRON- only rant

the bread be very fresh and the beef seem to be very well_season
-PRON- also come with a cup of jus that -PRON- definitely need
-PRON- will def go_back if -PRON- be ever in the mood for an italian beef sandwich but -PRON- would prob skip the sausage next_time
order some sushi for pick_up on just eat.com

haha
-PRON- be a huge_fan_of tacos de cabeza alot of place have too_much fat and be really greasy but here -PRON- on point
-PRON- have not try any of the plate -PRON- have on the menu usually stick to taco
-PRON- daughter get a cheese quesadilla on a corn_tortilla and -PRON- hubby almost get one of each taco on the menu ha
the green salsa the have there be the good -PRON- have have since -PRON- mother in law the guacamole sauce
i think that_s what -PRON- be be also great
on -PRON- last_visit i have do take out order 4 taco de cabeza i be crave -PRON- like crazy take less_than 10_min take -PRON- another 10 to get home peel back the foil and realize that -PRON- get carne_asada i be so sad or fat that i get dissapoint and eat -PRON- food unhappy but that be partially -PRON- fault for not check -PRON- order
-PRON- will be back soon when -PRON- be crave taco
hmmm
-PRON- be conflict and a_bit perplexed by this one
first let -PRON- admit that -PRON- buy a livingsocial deal to this_place and accidentally let -PRON- expire on sept 3rd
knowing this -PRON- call the restaurant and speak with jerry the manager
after -PRON- tell -PRON- the deal expire -PRON- tell -PRON- do_not worry_about -PRON- -PRON- will still take -PRON-
-PRON- be extremely pleasant on the phone
and -PRON- presume that -PRON- mean that the full deal would still be honor
on the same_day that -PRON- call and speak with jerry the manager -PRON- go over to garcia 's
after sit_down at -PRON- table the server tell -PRON- that -PRON- can only accept the pay value for the deal which be the amount that -PRON- already pay and that -PRON- will be deduct from -PRON- bill
-PRON- explain that this be not -PRON- understanding after talk to jerry the manager but -PRON- say that -PRON- just talk to jerry about -PRON-
while -PRON- do_not ask for jerry because sometimes -PRON- just do_not feel_like fight -PRON- be very displeased at the miscommunication that take place here
-PRON- be deduct four_star for this whole debacle
with all of that say the pollo fundido be very good even_though -PRON- spellcheck keep change -PRON- to pool funded and the house margarita help to turn -PRON- frown upside down but the crowning moment of this visit be the fry ice_cream
take -PRON- back to -PRON- childhood and all be good again
for garcia 's mexican_restaurant this mean -PRON- add a star back
-PRON- would go_back because of the food and fry ice_cream but not the service
-PRON- come_here mostly because -PRON- cousin leslie give -PRON- a $_50 chang 's gift_card as -PRON- wedding present
-PRON- have always appreciate that this be one of the healthy restaurant chain
there be a heavy emphasis on fresh veggie but as long as -PRON- include -PRON- notoriously addictive crispy green_bean -PRON- do_not_mind one bit
so -PRON- be kind_of strange that -PRON- actually do_not have the green_bean on this trip
probably because for -PRON- at_least the chicken lettuce wraps take precedence over everything
-PRON- be always be -PRON- go to here to help -PRON- with -PRON- crunchy fix
-PRON- also decide to chow down with cecelia 's pork dumplings the chicken and the pork egg rolls
there be multiple order of everything yes -PRON- make that -PRON- go a little nut but -PRON- be not a bad thing
paired with drink -PRON- app dinner be so satisfying that -PRON- really do_not need dessert
-PRON- know that sound_like -PRON- have a choice but -PRON- be so stuff that -PRON- do_not
the service be excellent as always
not really a mystery why -PRON- have not be back in so long since there be so_many great place to eat in the valley now so that -PRON- never have to go to the strip if -PRON- do_not want to
-PRON- will need to leave a reminder for -PRON- sometime to come_back to chang 's every few_week so -PRON- will not need the excuse of a gift_card
beware of abbey dental
-PRON- go because the commercial look really homely and -PRON- go there
-PRON- be not

the doctor that come in just look in -PRON- mouth for not even a minute

-PRON- can_not do this
-PRON- be freak out

-PRON- cancel -PRON- follow_up appt
and do_not say -PRON- be go_somewhere_else
but -PRON- get a call and someone_else say that -PRON- hear -PRON- be go_somewhere cheaper and -PRON- would match -PRON-
hell
no
the 2nd opinion doctor say -PRON- only need 4 filling
that and the exam
-PRON- pay only $ 371
abbey dental do_not want to save tooth
-PRON- want -PRON- hard_earn money
-PRON- definitely do_not even deserve a 1_star

-PRON- be not over crowd like the other tim and -PRON- order be do as_soon the first minute -PRON- get there

not only do -PRON- tell -PRON- what aisle the product be in -PRON- go with -PRON- and explain_how -PRON- have use -PRON-
-PRON- finish -PRON- list and be greet at the register where -PRON- double bag -PRON- item

das ganesha west war ganz ok
der service war trotz großer indischer
gruppe mit eigenem buffet recht aufmerksam und das_essen war auch in ordnung für den preis
wir hatten das menü iii für 3 anstatt
2 personen bestellt und haben
es nicht geschafft alle aufzuessen
das lokal hätte jedoch um
den
tisch herum durchaus etwa sauberer sein können
beim nächsten besuch in stuttgart würde ich evtl einen anderen inder probieren
-PRON- luck into katherine at awesome nails when -PRON- move here in the summer of 2013
although -PRON- travel for work -PRON- try to get here at_least_once a month
not only be these two sister professional in every way -PRON- have the most up to date color
-PRON- have to have an_appointment since -PRON- be super busy
-PRON- text -PRON- the time -PRON- can come in
and -PRON- give -PRON- an_appointment within those timeframe
-PRON- price be competitive but mostly -PRON- come to awesome nail for the perfect nail toe and ton_of laughter
isn't that what -PRON- be really about when -PRON- have this service do
-PRON- be force into -PRON- thai by -PRON- daughter on labor day sort_of
-PRON- have just get do with shopping and the evil twin have a taste for something asian
this would be -PRON- second_time eat_here -PRON- just never get around to review -PRON- first trip
-PRON- stop in around 3 and the restaurant be empty but -PRON- be warmly greet_by fawn -PRON- waitress who sit -PRON- next to one of the large window look out onto w. liberty ave
the menu be not jam packed or confusing daughter order pad_thai and -PRON- get the tom yum noodle_soup with seafood add
-PRON- both choose heat level 4 but end_up need a_few extra spoon of thai chili and hot_sauce
the pad_thai look really good with tofu and a mixture_of vegetable
daughter say -PRON- be not salty like some other place or mushy
-PRON- tom yum noodle_soup be flavorful and have a nice mixture_of seafood octopus ring mussel shrimp and piece_of fish
the broth be a blend of fish sauce lemongrass and or beef broth
sweet savory and tangy if that make_sense
overall yumminess the noodle be rice_noodle nicely chewy and the bok_choy bright green with freshness
-PRON- share the sweet sticky_rice with mango for dessert just let -PRON- eat sweet sticky_rice with coconut milk every_day
the service be friendly and the food hit the spot
after watch top chef and have already be to michael voltaggio 's stellar restaurant the dining_room -PRON- wife and -PRON- have be look_forward_to try tom colicchio 's craftsteak for several month
so the first thing -PRON- do when arrive at vegas be make_reservation
-PRON- will mention a_few thing
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be both under 30 and -PRON- be a party of two
-PRON- have always feel that if -PRON- really want to know_how good a restaurant truly be -PRON- visit as a party of two
any restaurant in the world will bend over backwards to make a big party happy server know that more people = big tip but when a restaurant treat a couple well -PRON- know that -PRON- have class
sad to say this be the most classless fine_dining experience that -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- would have complain to the manager have -PRON- be anywhere to be find
alas yelp.com get the supreme pleasure of hear the brutal truth
have fun with this guys\/gal
first for $ 110 a person -PRON- can eat like a king in_vegas
the food here be edible but so be the food at any $_30 buffet in_town
-PRON- come to a place like this for top_notch service and mind_blow food craftsteak fail at both
service 1\/5
as many yelper have suggest the service here be almost non_existent until -PRON- be fill out the tip line on the check when -PRON- become patronizing
-PRON- wait nearly 20_minute before one of -PRON- four server even_bother to ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to get drink and another 20_minute before -PRON- ask if -PRON- want to order
with four server -PRON- would think that a party of two would be able_to place a drink and food order within a half_hour
now before -PRON- think that this be intentional politeness on -PRON- part nobody like to be urge to order right_away at a nice restaurant this be not that this be -PRON- be nearly oblivious to the fact_that -PRON- be in the restaurant in the first place
which be odd because -PRON- make_reservation and be seat front and center in the middle_of the dining_room
still optimistic -PRON- ask for an explanation about how the restaurant prefer to serve -PRON- 's guest but instead_of be offer a clear explanation of the menu the waiter ramble off a nearly incoherent sentence or two about how -PRON- should really just order from the chef_'s tasting_menu
ok thank for nothing -PRON- be at craftsteak
-PRON- know that -PRON- be here for the chef_'s tasting_menu
-PRON- come to spend
20 more minute pass before the next of -PRON- waiter arrive
-PRON- again advise -PRON- on the chef_'s tasting_menu
-PRON- urge -PRON- to explain the tasting_menu and finally -PRON- get an explanation which would have be great except that -PRON- get -PRON- number completely mixed up
-PRON- explain that each guest receive 2 salad tasting 2 meat tasting and 2 side tasting
-PRON- math say that mean 6 different tasting per_person 12 total
another yelper mention 16 plate of food per couple so that sound about right
-PRON- wait another 15 before anyone come_back to take -PRON- order
the third waiter show_up like the friggin hero of the day
-PRON- proceed to place -PRON- order -PRON- inform -PRON- that -PRON- have everything wrong -PRON- only get 1 of each tasting selection which be kinda funny because -PRON- defeat the purpose of the tasting_menu if -PRON- be just go to serve massive family size portion of a_few thing but whatev
-PRON- order the tasting_menu the wagyu beef version which be $ 130\/person
about 30 second pass before -PRON- do a little math and realize that -PRON- be actually pay quite a_bit_more for the tasting_menu than if -PRON- have just order ala carte for the item that -PRON- want to try thank to -PRON- fellow yelpers bisque quail yukon puree filet etc
throughout the meal server rarely come to the table to check on -PRON-
service be tacky although -PRON- be so pretentious that someone may confuse -PRON- for -PRON- be fancy
cmon yelper
-PRON- be not fancy to leave cold uneaten bread on the table for the entire meal when -PRON- have the main_course out
-PRON- be not fancy to leave the clean empty wine glass on the table when -PRON- be on -PRON- second round of cocktail
fine_dining establishment be careful to manicure the eat process this feel_like -PRON- be at tgif fridays
server bumble around break 2 wine glass and hop no one saw
-PRON- have dirty finished plate of food in front of -PRON- for the majority_of the meal
-PRON- drink sit empty for no less_than 25 minute
-PRON- could go on but yelp limit -PRON- to 5000 letter food 2\/5 the ribeye be tasty but thin and cover in fat and gristle
the filet be overcook
the lobster_bisque taste_like -PRON- be douse in fennel seed
the quail onion and yukon be good
the rest be mediocre at best
again -PRON- be edible but for $ 110 + per_person -PRON- jaw should be in -PRON- lap
bad no ever check on -PRON- despite $ 270 of food be on the table
save -PRON- cash or good use -PRON- for a plane to la and visit the dining_room
-PRON- leave disappointed
ok -PRON- get to say the pizza here be not very good
but
the pokey stix
oh -PRON- god
-PRON- do_not realize a good thing until -PRON- be take_away_from -PRON-
since move out of champaign -PRON- have have friend bring -PRON- some pokey stixs up here to chicago
also the last_time -PRON- go down there with a friend
-PRON- make -PRON- try this stuff
-PRON- love -PRON- as_well
-PRON- get to love the ranch as_well_as the marinara dipping_sauce
both of -PRON- be excellent
-PRON- know_what and the goodness last and be somehow even good as left over
just throw -PRON- in the oven and -PRON- be awesome all over again
-PRON- guy should start deliver to chicago somehow
this_place be locate inside galleria mall
the young staff that work there be friendly but the ice_cream have a weird taste to -PRON-
-PRON- order the same_thing at 2 other location and -PRON- have no issue
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be the product or if the machine need more cleaning but something need to change
-PRON- have be let -PRON- brow run loose have not touch -PRON- for a while
so i can try thread
-PRON- want to try forever young salon but -PRON- be close
apollo be just a couple store away_from forever
-PRON- be really nervous because -PRON- be -PRON- first_time
sat in the chair and in a matter of three minute i be do
painless
love the result
-PRON- definitely will go_back
cheap as_well 5 buck
the place have get the hype
no deny that fact
have get out the word of the special on various day
-PRON- go on a vegan\/veggie night on a wednesday
-PRON- be pack around 8_p.m. and be seat after a 20_min wait
ambience be that of a sport_bar with not many television
noice level be high which definitely avoid some embarrasment for family like -PRON- with a 2 yr old screaming at the top of -PRON- voice
the pimms cup with lime juice and 7up be light in the beginning but get to -PRON- if sip on an empty stomach
amish chicken_wing have a smokey bbq flavour and lite too_sweet for -PRON- taste
veg slider be the good part of -PRON- meal however for $_10 -PRON- could have take a spicy chicken sandwich from wendy_'s and a large cajun fry from 5 guy and would have enjoy -PRON- good
lastly the potato gnocchi be so bland that -PRON- finish half the pepper and salt shaker
no pun intend
why the 3_star that be because of how the owner have hype the place to make -PRON- busy than many restaurant be even on weekend
price be reasonable for the portion
go here the other day with -PRON- friend to get boba get really fast service the place seem really friendly
definitely go to back for more
-PRON- always feel sorta corny go to tea infusion because -PRON- be at tempe marketplace
but -PRON- just have to get over
that because this be what be close to home
and -PRON- be what -PRON- be
be a green_tea purist
-PRON- like that -PRON- have lotsa green or at_least more_than most
and of_course the wi fi be a plus
-PRON- be there now get some writing do and now that the obnoxious teen have leave -PRON- can get back to that and stop dilly dally around on_yelp
there be always something extra go on----worker discuss wayyyyy personal feminine matter not in -PRON- wayyyyy personal feminine matter voice
call -PRON- old_fashioned but -PRON- would_rather not be privy to such when -PRON- be sip green
so -PRON- do remember to bring headphone this time
ok 3_star sorta suck but professionalism count darn -PRON-
-PRON- can_not rate -PRON- on food or other fruity\/chocolaty\/milky\/boba concoction but -PRON- know that there be a bacon dish on the menu because -PRON- have smell -PRON- 2 of the 3 time that -PRON- have be
that annoy -PRON-
but that be just -PRON- -PRON- guess lot_of people like bacon and tea
-PRON- should stop rat
but sometimes -PRON- just have to get outside and write even_though -PRON- have load of green_tea at home
next_time -PRON- will stay home
enjoy the green_tea
this negative_review be drive_by chanel corporate lack of transparency in -PRON- return policy and could have happen in any one of -PRON-
us store the review be link to the actual store be the purchase be make
-PRON- wife own a number_of chanel luxury item as_well_as product from other similar high_end brand
in this instance -PRON- be interested_in a watch and with the help of the sale agent who be friendly accommodate select the product that -PRON- think -PRON- want
immediately on leave the store -PRON- have second thought and the follow day
-PRON- go_back to the store to try to do a return
the product have not be wear or even remove from -PRON- packaging in the intervene 12-hr period
on return to the shop -PRON- be tell that a return of the money that be pay for the watch be not possible and the only option be to do an exchange for other item in the store as this be the corporate policy
-PRON- challenge that -PRON- believe this be not normal in the us and -PRON- have not be tell this by the sale agent
the manger of the store be summon and be very firm on the issue and point -PRON- to the sale receipt where -PRON- do indeed say that jewelry and watches can only be exchange not refund
this feel very much like a corporate gotya as of_course -PRON- only get sale receipt after -PRON- have already pay for the product
a subsequent search on the chanel website as of this review date confirm that nothing be mention about a no return policy on chanel jewelry or watch
so the message to other potential buyer of chanel jewelry or watch be be very aware that once -PRON- have pay there be a enforced non return policy -PRON- commission base sale agent be unlikely to tell -PRON- this up front and -PRON- will not find -PRON- on chanel 's website
yelp 's 365 review challenge 2015 5 365 back in california in the cabazon outlets
there be a godiva store that unfortunately have close and that be a bummer
walk_around the las_vegas premium outlet -PRON- see the godiva store and do_not hesitate to check -PRON- out
lot_of deal be to be have especially with the after christmas sale and some clearance item as_well
the line be a_bit long but -PRON- move quickly
-PRON- be give a free sample of -PRON- chocolate -PRON- think -PRON- be the fudge brownie truffle
-PRON- sell -PRON- mom on buy the pack that be on sale for 5 for $_25 which be a great deal
-PRON- have a display case and be surprised to -PRON- sell ice_cream
-PRON- will try -PRON- next_time -PRON- be shop in the outlet
friendly_staff who assist -PRON- right_away and answer -PRON- question about the price and chocolate
this be one habbit -PRON- do_not think -PRON- will be pick_up
while -PRON- may not be a bad habbit -PRON- think there be good one to be have
inside -PRON- look_like fast_food a counter menu above condiment station and table
but here -PRON- get a pager
vs a call and the price be a_bit high
-PRON- have a albacore tuna sandwich $ 5.75 a thin slab of tuna on a huge bun with ton_of tartar sauce and lettuce
-PRON- be not bad
but -PRON- like fish and do_not need to only taste the sauce
for a side -PRON- have the onion_ring $ 1.95 -PRON- be not special at all with a breadcrumb type coating and thin onion inside
overall -PRON- be unimpressed and the vlaue be not quiet there
-PRON- be unsuccessful at put in new lock on -PRON- own so -PRON- call phoenix lockmaster
mike come right out and be very_friendly and helpful
-PRON- be frustrate with -PRON- failure and -PRON- put -PRON- at_ease and get -PRON- all fix up in a short amount_of time
-PRON- be great and -PRON- be very thankful
have this_place on speed dial
easy to order by fone pickup have a very_reasonable healthy meal
altho -PRON- do splurge on the lemon oregano fry sometimes
-PRON- portion be great
not 2_3 strip of chicken in the wrap much_more and only $_6
always fresh
awesome environment with good music friendly service and tasty food
everyone work together as a team which make the atmosphere so_much good
from start to finish -PRON- be not a fan_of this office
the front_desk_staff be short when booking and pretty rude when -PRON- walk_in
-PRON- have a_few question on the form and -PRON- be snippy which come off quite unprofessional
the doctor walk_in and ask if -PRON- have be there before
even before introduce -PRON- and should have know -PRON- be a new_patient if -PRON- have look_at -PRON- chart
-PRON- remove a_few mole and the doctor tell -PRON- the result would be in to -PRON- in a week
as_soon_as -PRON- leave the nurse ask to stay in the room as -PRON- change to finish -PRON- note unprofessional again
then tell -PRON- the timeframe will really be 2_3 week way longer than what the doctor say
-PRON- would not recommend this office
there be way to many_other dermatologist that care_about patient and treat -PRON- professionally
-PRON- think that -PRON- would come to koreatown just to visit the food court
the greenland supermarket meet all of -PRON- asian food need desire want etc
-PRON- like the variety and of dry good produce and meat
-PRON- would be more helpful if all of the display be both in english and korean
-PRON- be the korean american kid that do_not pay_attention much to -PRON- korean language skill
the good thing -PRON- like about the greenland supermarket be find all the great thing that -PRON- do_not_know -PRON- need until -PRON- walk by the display
sushi garden be one -PRON- favourite spot in the yonge and st clair area for a quick but delicious lunch
-PRON- have a great selection of lunch_special with very affordable price especially consider the location of the restaurant
for instance $ 5.99 get -PRON- a general portion of chicken teriyaki with miso_soup complimentary japanese tea and consistently prompt and courteous service
the quality of the sushi at sushi garden be also decent and definitely_worth the price_tag
the only odd part be -PRON- will take credit_card but not debit_card or american express so be aware before -PRON- step in
-PRON- need a stylist in green valley and after a little research -PRON- make_an_appointment with gwen for cut and color
-PRON- have only see one negative_review and that person have say -PRON- be rude
idk what universe that person live in as -PRON- find gwen to be a lovely person
friendly funny and sweet
as_far as the cut and the color i'm thrill with the result
-PRON- know_how to cut -PRON- hair properly
most stylist have cut layer into -PRON- hair for body' and that be something -PRON- have in spade
-PRON- have not have to touch -PRON- flat iron once since gwen do -PRON- hair -PRON- lay perfectly just use a blowdryer which be a first
-PRON- be so happy
-PRON- find -PRON- and will_definitely be go_back to -PRON- from now on
-PRON- will be recommend -PRON- to anyone_who ask
great cut\/color and a wonderful person
staff be friendly selection be good
feel bad -PRON- have to deal with all these annoying whiney soccer mom_'s all day
so people from_hawaii who come to las_vegas love this boyd hotel
this hotel have the good buffet downtown with the most selection
-PRON- also have a couple of other good restaurant too that -PRON- hawaii local enjoy
the room be clean and decent
this be the nice of the boyd hotel in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- be one of the vacations hawaii package hotel location and -PRON- have us rental_car place on_site which be super convenient
there be also a free_wifi area if -PRON- need -PRON-
the casino have a good variety_of game and be brightly light
-PRON- feel spacious unlike the other cramp casino downtown
the parking_lot be a little strange
there be an empty parking_lot attendant box
and after -PRON- park -PRON- take the stair down and walk to the hotel not as convenient as the cal
the staff be very_friendly and will treat -PRON- like ohana
bad pedicure of -PRON- life
tech do_not speak any english
remove -PRON- polish with an emery board then nail file
cut -PRON- toe nail unevenly
have to ask more_than once to cut 6 nail short
do_not trim cuticle
do_not put anything between -PRON- toe
awful
the highlight nearly unsurpassed whiskey selection
the bar be beautiful with the bottle line up single file and illuminate along the back of the bar
make_sure -PRON- ask for the ipad with the spirit menu
-PRON- carry the entire van winkle line several vintage of several buffalo trace antique collection bottle multiple iteration of parker heritage college and many rare bottle like michters celebration ah hirsch 16 and four roses marriage
all the whiskey be available in 1 and 2 oz pour
the cocktail be interesting take on modern classic and often feature neat house make component
the decor be like an upscale resort hunt lodge with a very large antler chandelier
the food be in_general very good
the special be constantly change and usually feature interesting highlighted ingredient like pork cheek rabbit waygu beef and diver scallop
make_sure -PRON- get the focaccia and brussels as starter
server be useful with suggestion for food drink and meal planning
-PRON- come by frequently to refill water and get drink order
of_course go to vegas with -PRON- vietnamese family mean get -PRON- pho fix on at_least_once in_vegas during -PRON- stay this time -PRON- be on -PRON- way out from vegas
this be one of the good pho restaurant in_vegas -PRON- have everything on -PRON- menu and reasonably_price too
-PRON- service be kinda sucky but -PRON- guess that be understandable since this_place be pack all hour of the day until closing
-PRON- guess this_place be the place to be when -PRON- need -PRON- pho fix
obviously -PRON- be not as good as what -PRON- can find in -PRON- mom_'s kitchen or possibly out in bolsa but -PRON- decently_price and taste good enough
this be obviously a come_back place
duh
lol
-PRON- have love diner food all -PRON- life and thank to all the greek family that have settle in_charlotte for a long_time there be plenty_of delicious diner food to go around
now as those restaurant steadily close -PRON- be hard to find diner food that be not just bland hamburger and fry fare
the diamond have plenty_of good hamburger option but like all true diner that be not all -PRON- specialize_in
there be also a healthy amount_of salad sandwich blue plate special and regular dinner entree to make -PRON- mouth water
and if the taste seem familiar a lot_of folk work at the diamond come from the penguin before -PRON- close down
-PRON- love_this_place and eat_here often
-PRON- be not always the easy_parking situation but the food be great the staff be friendly and that be the most_important part right
get the milkshake -PRON- soo good
sandwich be literally worth the wait
love the location near -PRON- work and employee ' be always happy
heist be a vast vision of a restaurant for the noda area
-PRON- be not just a brewery despite the sneaky little name
there be a couple of other brewery that be only brewery just down the road
and -PRON- do a great_job of brewing beer
but heist be not just a bar
there be some bar staple and a charlotte must have pretzel and beer cheese
chef rob be also pull out all the stop with adventurous menu_item like shrimp and lemon wasabi cotton_candy compressed watermelon flatbread with key ingredient like duck and veal cheek
-PRON- be not -PRON- run of the mill brewpub ok
because heist be so high profile and new than some of the other brewery there appear to be mixed review in_term_of the beer
-PRON- defy -PRON- to spend 5_minute with the brewer zach and come away anything but baptize into the heist beer family
-PRON- be a fan_of the i2pa but -PRON- recently have a hefe that -PRON- do_not hate
that be a miracle for -PRON-
-PRON- would be remiss if -PRON- do_not mention the cocktail menu
that be one place where heist show_up every other brewery style restaurant -PRON- have experience
-PRON- bar staff be on point friendly and always whip up flavorful inventive creation straight from the brilliant mind of award win mixologist stefan huebner
recently the mr and -PRON- venture in for brunch since -PRON- have hear good thing
-PRON- be around 1 p.m. on a sunday and -PRON- be ravenous
-PRON- appreciation for the buffet style offering be as follow vegetarian_option galore waffle and omelette station bread_pudding fresh fruit etc
at only $_15 -PRON- be a charlotte brunch bargain
-PRON- opt_for a carafe of sangria and be very_pleased_with -PRON- choice
just what the doctor order on a sunday after church
also of note the interior be really easy on the eye
very creatively break up into space that make -PRON- feel at once cozy and austere
-PRON- really just must experience -PRON-
when -PRON- need travel insurance for -PRON- vacation in austria john chase arrange -PRON- in just one day and the price be reasonable

-PRON- order superfood salad with tofu and curry_chicken
the salad be super fresh and portion_size be huge
the rice be al_dente
green tomato gazpacho be little on the salty side but be interesting
love the casual atmosphere and friendly_staff and quick service
highly_recommend
this_place be so good -PRON- can never get a seat
-PRON- advise -PRON- come by during the summer
lot_of nice place for a little picnic in old mtl
-PRON- have stay_at mgm the wynn treasures and nyny and the mirage be by_far the bad
to start the service on the casino level for cocktail be non_existent
-PRON- have 1 good waitress in five day of gambling
-PRON- be rude when -PRON- do provide service
-PRON- would sit_down at a slot and average wait time to see a server
be about 45_minute then always at_least 20_minute to get -PRON- drink once -PRON- place -PRON- order
the room be small and old
-PRON- be clean but stain carpet water pressure be weak in the shower and -PRON- just look_like a cheap room
-PRON- stay in the deluxe premium view room
-PRON- expectation be an mgm resort be high however the experience be pretty awful
additionally the buffet -PRON- visit for breakfast twice be average\/below average
-PRON- also try the breakfast at harrahs and flamingo
all three leave a lot_of room for improvement
if -PRON- have visit golden corral then -PRON- have visit the mirage buffet
the food be fresh and the drink station be neat but everything_else be just ok
-PRON- would suggest to spend a_few more dollar go to the left and eat at the wynn buffet
perhaps -PRON- expectation be way_too high since the price be more_than mgm and nyny but the price suggest four_star and realistically the hotel be a 2_star facility
a major con be that the only option for coffee be starbucks and -PRON- have limited hour only open at 530am
for the early riser in order to get a drink -PRON- have to walk across the street to the linq for a coffee
shana be incredible
-PRON- have be look for a new colorist and could_not have be more happy with shana
-PRON- explain what -PRON- be go for show -PRON- picture and -PRON- give -PRON- exactly_what -PRON- want

the few_time -PRON- have file claim -PRON- have take over 6 week to process when -PRON- sign_up -PRON- say -PRON- will take a max of 2_week
-PRON- be currently wait for a claim and have be charge premium while wait for a refund that be clearly cover so -PRON- be out more money than if -PRON- have not be insure
-PRON- be so thrilled that pure barre come to chandler
-PRON- be the good hour long full body workout with upbeat music and encouraging instructor
-PRON- be 15 day into -PRON- 30 day challenge and be a little addicted to how good -PRON- feel after each class
-PRON- can feel -PRON- body change one inch at a time

lift tone burn baby
-PRON- really do like the curry goat roti here
in fact_that be all -PRON- have purchase
and -PRON- have be back a number_of time
-PRON- have be in business a long_time
and -PRON- do sometimes wonder_why -PRON- do_not renovate the place to make -PRON- look a_bit good because -PRON- think this be the original decor
-PRON- must have the fund for -PRON- after be in business so long
that be -PRON- only_complaint
the curry goat roti be great
criss -PRON- need good people around -PRON-
this production do_not do a good job to show off -PRON- talent and -PRON- staff in the theater be very unfriendly
there be about 25 other show in_las_vegas -PRON- would_rather see
would not waste the money people just -PRON- opinion from the insider of vegas
-PRON- have 2 pug that -PRON- guard with -PRON- life and -PRON- feel that the staff here do the same
whether -PRON- be away for 9 day in maui and call everyday to check in or just drop -PRON- off for a day of doggy daycare fun and excersize the staff be always welcome and happy to oblige -PRON- every need
-PRON- smile and dote over -PRON- baby what could be good
and of_course the most telling sign that this be a great place be the reaction -PRON- get from -PRON- pug when -PRON- pull in and -PRON- can_not get out of the car and inside the door fast enough
super highly_recommend by this pug owner
wtf
-PRON- have never review tryst
lol
ok so seriously -PRON- first_time here -PRON- be weird
go down the hallway to stair lead down
first thought
now if -PRON- get waste -PRON- would really hurt go
-PRON- dunno up
stairs
especially_since -PRON- be stone and probably no cushion for fall
-PRON- be sure there be a formula for drunk+up+stumble+stone\/marble step =
owie
when -PRON- get inside the club be definitely beautiful -PRON- open up to a large dancefloor follow_by a panaramic view of a waterfall
-PRON- be here when -PRON- be also -PRON- think
call bete

then -PRON- come_here for some nfl party which be retard pack with people and celebs and ball player flow with roederer cristal and make -PRON- rain for peons
-PRON- also come one time and almost get into a fight by catch this guy 's arm as -PRON- be about to smack one of -PRON- gfs and finally
-PRON- come and watch people make out a couple one redhead and some dude almost boink -PRON- outside by the waterfall as -PRON- dress keep rid up and -PRON- white pantie expose to the public while on the other corner some guy 's get two asian girl worship -PRON- like some fallic symbol

-PRON- do hate the drink price
-PRON- mean the last_time -PRON- go
3 shot be like 42 dollar
really
redhead slut be not go to get -PRON- that mess_up
music be not bad
ambiance be expensive and beautiful
what -PRON- be go to get screw on be line
if -PRON- do_not frequent that often like moi then -PRON- get to push -PRON- weight around
even bouncer do_not_know_what the hell be go on
even when -PRON- be suppose to get a line pass
so yes like every other club
everyone have an ulterior motive
what -PRON- say
down with the hundred dollar handshake

late lunch in cleveland
the food have lot_of great flavor get a fish_taco and a pollo rojo taco and some chip and guac all delicious
-PRON- have lot_of great drink special though -PRON- have to skip out on -PRON- due_to work
seem_like a great lunch or drink bite spot
service be horrible
a girlfriend of mine say -PRON- have be here before and the service be wonderful and the food be as_well
so -PRON- decide to take -PRON- here for lunch for a great experience
-PRON- give -PRON- more_than 3 chance to rectify the situation but -PRON- do nothing besides give -PRON- a bellini on the house which -PRON- could have pay for -PRON- own no_problem
first -PRON- order a warm brie with caramelize apple appetizer that -PRON- serve -PRON- cold
the waiter indeed take the cold brie and serve -PRON- a fresh one
but while -PRON- be wait for the warm brie the food_runner bring -PRON- entree out
and -PRON- inform -PRON- -PRON- still have not have a chance to enjoy -PRON- appetizer
and -PRON- simply be not ready for out entree
the food_runner have the nerve to ask -PRON- well what do -PRON- want -PRON- to do with the food then in a very ugly and agitated tone
then -PRON- have the nerve to tell -PRON- -PRON- will set -PRON- aside until -PRON- be ready to have -PRON-
-PRON- friend then tell -PRON- well -PRON- will be cold by the time -PRON- finish -PRON- appetite and the food_runner again say well what be -PRON- suppose to do and -PRON- just order salad any way
so -PRON- do_not_matter if -PRON- sit -PRON- aside or not
-PRON- actually order a grill shrimp salad so -PRON- should have have hot fresh grill shrimp
which -PRON- would think -PRON- be -PRON- job to figure_out_what -PRON- be go to do and not ask -PRON- how to fix the situation
so -PRON- friend very respectfully tell -PRON- that -PRON- will just have to make -PRON- fresh plate unfortunately because -PRON- appetizer be not serve properly
the food_runner roll -PRON- eye and literally stomp off with the food
-PRON- be livid at this point
so when -PRON- waiter come_back to the table -PRON- explain to -PRON- what have happen and -PRON- seem appal about the situation and say -PRON- would talk to -PRON- because -PRON- should have automatically take the food back when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be still wait on out appetizer and that -PRON- be common sense
-PRON- would have fresh dish prepare
so after the brie come_out fresh and -PRON- honestly love -PRON-
actually an_amazing appetizer when serve properly
the same food_runner come_back with -PRON- entree and when -PRON- come_out -PRON- have no dressing at all on -PRON-
so instead_of try to come off like -PRON- be try to complain_about -PRON-
-PRON- ask -PRON- do this dish come with dressing or be -PRON- mean to be a dry salad
-PRON- ask only because -PRON- could be possible -PRON- serve -PRON- dry maybe
so -PRON- look_at -PRON- salad and clearly see there be not a drop of dress on -PRON- and sigh and say would -PRON- like -PRON- to bring -PRON- some dressing to put on -PRON-
by this time -PRON- feel_like get up and walk_out but -PRON- relax and again explain to the waiter what_happen with the same food_runner -PRON- observe -PRON- salad and clearly say oh definitely there be not dress on -PRON-
-PRON- then apologize to the waiter because -PRON- do_not like to be that complain type customer
and -PRON- say all the right thing and take the salad to go put dressing on -PRON- which be what the food_runner should have do instead_of bring -PRON- dress to dress -PRON- own salad
but -PRON- explain to the waiter -PRON- do_not even want the salad anymore and to forget -PRON-
-PRON- insist -PRON- would make -PRON- something special to compensate for the horrible service -PRON- be receive so -PRON- attempt to give -PRON- a third try to fix the problem
-PRON- then bring -PRON- the dish which -PRON- do_not get to enjoy because -PRON- be so upset from everything that happen -PRON- end_up no eat -PRON-
so when the bill come -PRON- realize -PRON- do_not only charge -PRON- for the special dish -PRON- make to compensate for the horrible service but -PRON- charge -PRON- for the shrimp salad -PRON- never touch
-PRON- be in complete shock and -PRON- be so over the whole_experience
-PRON- just give -PRON- friend the money to pay the bill and -PRON- walk_out
-PRON- will_definitely never be go there again and if -PRON- know_what s good for -PRON- -PRON- should fire that food_runner because -PRON- be sure with -PRON- attitude -PRON- be not the first customer -PRON- have run off
go here today for the first_time for happy_hour

-PRON- visit on a tuesday evening at 7:00 pm as part of a large party of around 20 people more or less

-PRON- look_like parking be free after 9:00 pm
second the food
-PRON- order a the chimichurri chicken pizza at $_16 b the fish_taco appetizer size which be 3 taco at $_13 and one pepsi
the food come quickly and be to -PRON- surprise delicious
the fish_taco be surprisingly not slather in batter and be perfectly light and flavourful -PRON- could actually taste the fish hence be fish_taco after all
-PRON- also have a taste of the dirty fry which be perfectly crispy but if -PRON- have one complaint -PRON- could have use more sauce part of the platter be all dry fry with very little topping
for two people -PRON- total with the automatic large party gratuity be $ 41.72
lastly the service
for a group -PRON- size -PRON- be surprised at how pleasant the service be
-PRON- server be gracious friendly and attentive for most of -PRON- meal
while the wait for -PRON- bill be a little long -PRON- still have to commend the above_average service for a group -PRON- size
overall a good experience
and if -PRON- be look for a spot to host a large_group for a birthday or special_occasion this spot could very well be an option for -PRON-

lot_of fun
-PRON- dislike give salty review but -PRON- experience here be not as relaxing as -PRON- have hop
a colleague gift two gift_card to -PRON- for a 45_minute session in the salt room and -PRON- have be mean to check -PRON- -PRON- ever since
-PRON- have hear great thing_about this_place and -PRON- be long_overdue for some de stress
-PRON- make -PRON- appointment in_advance which -PRON- would_recommend do so since special session be often hold in the room
-PRON- guess -PRON- be envision a relaxing spa like atmosphere upon_arrival but the entire reception area be clutter with salt rock and handmade jewelry for sale
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- have to fill out a form prior to enter the salt room
-PRON- be ask to provide personal information address phone_number medical history emergency contact that -PRON- feel_like only -PRON- doctor should know
there be also a disclaimer about how -PRON- may experience cough during session due_to the salt cleanse -PRON- body of impurity or_whatev
after paperwork -PRON- be lead to the salt room where -PRON- lay on recline chair
two other people be also in the room with -PRON- which -PRON- think be awkward
once the door be close the enyaesque music begin follow_by a loud muffle rumble sound in the distance that last almost the entire duration of -PRON- session
the speaker be also make strange sound as_well
both -PRON- boyfriend and be not affect by the salt but the other in the room be cough like crazy
when the session end one of the lady from the front_desk open the door to tell -PRON- -PRON- be over
to -PRON- -PRON- experience be over when -PRON- see a shirtless man wear cargo short and a black necktie with marijuana leaf enter the shop -PRON- can_not make that up folk
imo this_place do_not live_up to the hype
really happy with the work do by these_guy
always courteous timely and knowledgeable
-PRON- do the work promise and mention potential future issue but without_any pressure
-PRON- name be tony and -PRON- be a coalaholic
let -PRON- start by say -PRON- grow_up on pizza hut
not particularly by choice
but -PRON- mom work there and irresponsibly love ya mom
bring home those lovely grease fill cheese and meat cover circle of dough to -PRON- family nearly every other day
anytime -PRON- be hungry pizza hut pizza be wait for -PRON- in the fridge
and -PRON- develop a dependency to -PRON- pan pizza friend
fast_forward 20 something year and pizza hut be still -PRON- pie of choice over dominos papa john 's etc
-PRON- dig metro pizza cpk and other but not until -PRON- have grimaldi 's do the wool finally get pull from -PRON- eye
begin food review
oh the crust
-PRON- would never have authentic ny pizza prior to grimaldis -PRON- be sure there be some new yorker read this right_now shake -PRON- head due_to -PRON- belief of what real ny pizza be
to -PRON-
-PRON- say no one care
once -PRON- go coal blacken -PRON- never_go_back
every pizza -PRON- have have since have pal in comparison here be look_at -PRON- settebello
-PRON- like every type_of pizza -PRON- can get here
the regular with some pepperoni be simple and delicious
the white with garlic and anchovies
the pesto
no
the pesto
-PRON- absolute_favorite
pesto with pepperoni and meatball with some jalapeno on the side
absolute perfection
-PRON- typically eat the eastern location which -PRON- find the most consistently good though -PRON- do try the fashion show one a_few night ago and find -PRON- just as good on that one visit
ingredients taste fresh crust be that perfect nearly chewy texture
several calorie be devour that night
one other shout_out the bartender that be work that night be fantastic
-PRON- sit_at the bar for about half_an_hour wait for a friend and -PRON- make one of the good double jack and coke -PRON- would have in a while
-PRON- have several throughout the night note to reader
this may or may not have influence -PRON- food review
-PRON- do_not remember -PRON- name but the next_time -PRON- be in the fashion show and need a buzz before -PRON- get lose in the 20 floor of forever 21 swing by grimaldis with $ 10.50
the container park be nothing like anything -PRON- have ever see
the concept of building store out of shipping container mix with the vibrant color elaborate child_'s playground and stage with a lawn make for a great combination
if -PRON- have extra time downtown this be always where -PRON- hang_out especially at night
if -PRON- have kid this be definitely a spot -PRON- would take -PRON-
-PRON- almost feel_like a little urban oasis
-PRON- issue with the container park be the number_of store the store hour and the price_range of the store
while each store seem to be very unique there do_not seem to be enough store
-PRON- can easily blow through -PRON- all in twenty_minute
the store also close before the park so if -PRON- come at night do_not expect to be browse for anything
the store also seem to have very high price
even the candy ice_cream and food be overprice
the first_time -PRON- come_here -PRON- make a special trip for -PRON- but that be a_bit of a mistake
-PRON- should have wait until -PRON- be in the area with more thing to do
have anyone in this_place ever eat mexican_food
-PRON- get that -PRON- customer be mainly white people but -PRON- be sure -PRON- would love the real thing
the waitress be really nice
-PRON- have be to six penn many_time
-PRON- late visit be when -PRON- last go to the opera with mob mother of boy and -PRON- din at six penn before the show
-PRON- be seat promptly but then a waiter do_not appear for at_least fifteen_minute
the restaurant around 6:30 be pack and incredibly noisy
-PRON- could_not hear a word mob say during the entire meal
the upstairs dining_area be much good regard noise
after -PRON- be serve -PRON- aperitifs -PRON- wait another fifteen_minute for the waiter to take -PRON- food order
thank_goodness
-PRON- make an_early dinner reservation
mob have the pizza and -PRON- have the lamb bolognese
both be tasty although the bolognese could have use a_bit_more flavor
serving be very_generous
go to six penn on a nice weekday evening or a weekend afternoon
that way -PRON- can hear the people -PRON- be din with
the rooftop area be a fun place to have a_few drink as_well
-PRON- just wish the food menu have a_bit_more to offer
great place -PRON- offer thai_tea for check in yelp people
the price be so so but compare to what -PRON- get from the quality of food be in the middle 4 dish = 54 $ tip 10 grand total 64 so for some people may be reasonable for some people may be expensive depend_on perspective
-PRON- father in law try -PRON- thai ice_tea -PRON- get diarrhea at_least -PRON- should ask for lactose tolerate people
depend_on where -PRON- live -PRON- be a nice mall to visit
since -PRON- be outside -PRON- do get hot especially_during the summer time
-PRON- have a variety_of food service to restaurant and food joint like shake shack and crazy pita
-PRON- love -PRON- ice_cream shop call cream which offer various flavor for cookie ice_cream sandwiches
the shopping store be nice but if -PRON- be a collector of funko dolls there be a huge_selection of -PRON- at the toy box store
-PRON- may have a specific funko doll -PRON- be look for
highly_recommend to visit~
merry ann 's diner be a truck stop style 24_hour breakfast diner
unfortunately merry ann 's be not very good
-PRON- can_not recommend -PRON-
merry ann 's menu decor and layout and overall look and feel be identical to that of a waffle house franchise
-PRON- suspect that this diner be design to duplicate the successful waffle house model
all of the menu_item from the coffee egg and omelet down to toast and sweet roll be poor although some item be a notch better namely mediocre
service be roughly comparable to that of other waffle house store
ditto for the decor and in_fact the actual floor layout
price be low in absolute term but -PRON- be somewhat high for the type_of menu selection offer quality aside
and the quality deliver be mostly poor
before the hilton garden inn take over the property across the street there be a well regard breakfast restaurant almost a champaign institution attach to the property
the hilton raze the restaurant as part of -PRON- renovation
too_bad
the merry ann diner be not suitable for breakfast at any time of day
go to see steve aoki the bodyguard be be very rude
when -PRON- go in -PRON- be hot and way_too crowded
glad there be not any fire because this be a huge safety hazard
no place to move around
by the time 2:00am hit steve aoki be barely come_out
there be people stand on the table in front of -PRON- so -PRON- could_not see anything
the drink be wayyy overprice
-PRON- buy -PRON- ticket online and still wait more_than 2_hour
club be overrate in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- will not be come in again
make a reservation three week before dining here and request a table with a view of the bellagio fountain
-PRON- come 15_minute early and -PRON- be seat away_from the window
-PRON- notice an open table next to the window and request to be move there
the hostess inform -PRON- that the table be not ready and that -PRON- be already reserve
really
sure
bad start to the evening
wait 35_minute in an empty restaurant
poor rude service
the chicken taste rubbery and microwave
the 5_star be subjective this be the good sushi -PRON- have have within about a 6_hour drive
the chef and staff be very very_friendly and the establishment be very comfortable
rom be on time neatly dressed very_professional
-PRON- be able_to provide -PRON- with same_day service
-PRON- be quick to diagnose the problem with -PRON- refrigerator -PRON- price be reasonable
-PRON- would_highly_recommend absolute appliance services for any appliance repair
fortunately after have read the review in yelp about the paul mitchell school
-PRON- know -PRON- would be in the chair for quite some time but that be fine by -PRON- since -PRON- be well_worth -PRON- for the experience and the great haircut -PRON- get today
-PRON- can_not beat $_15 for shampoo conditioner scalp massage haircut style product and blow_dry
-PRON- mean come on
lexus -PRON- stylist be have -PRON- first day on the floor and
even_though nervous -PRON- do great
the instructor and -PRON- be so sorry
-PRON- do_not catch -PRON- name be so good with show lexus how to do the cut and cheer -PRON- on
-PRON- personality and patience be very good
the music be loud and there be so_many student and instructor run_around -PRON- sure make for high energy
-PRON- be the perfect place for -PRON- and -PRON- pickiness as_far as -PRON- haircut go and -PRON- can_not wait to return and have lexus do -PRON- color too
excellent lunch and attentive service
the menu be much_more varied than -PRON- use to be and there be now something for everyone
price be fair and -PRON- be a place -PRON- plan to visit regularly
north solidify and provide affirmation to -PRON- opinion of fox restaurant concepts as a whole
this one be on_par with the product -PRON- produce and -PRON- will say that -PRON- do -PRON- thing well
-PRON- know to expect a cool place well decorate creatively put together very trendy hip design and atmosphere
casual enough that -PRON- can go in and relax but edgy enough that the yuppie and trendy socialite will like to be see
the food be good but never memorable -PRON- need to go bag and have that good
the ingredient be fresh and the meal be well_prepared and creatively craft however that be what -PRON- should get for the price
north be no exception to any of these predisposition
the staff be good look in -PRON- plaid attire to convey the casual ness and -PRON- be promptly greet and thank on the way out
after about a 10_minute wait -PRON- be seat at one of the high top table in the bar_area which give a nice vantage point to see the neat array of material use in construction
the place be well staffed service be as -PRON- should be and everything be complete in a timely_manner
so let start with drink shall -PRON-
the wine_list be a_bit confusing because many of the variety be not common nomenclature
maybe -PRON- be wine ignorant but to -PRON- -PRON- seem as if -PRON- would have be more helpful to give a description of each or at_least order -PRON- from light to full body anything to give -PRON- a clue as to what be what
look to appetizer next more menu question arise
there be some item on the front page that should be order a la_carte -PRON- guess
to assemble an antipasti board of sort but then there be full blow app on the inside of the first page
a_bit confusing as to what be what
-PRON- simply want some bread to go with -PRON- italian fare and since -PRON- be not include -PRON- order the baked olive_oil bread from the front page
-PRON- be good but neither the two of -PRON- or -PRON- server be sure that -PRON- be go to receive what -PRON- be seek
the dinner menu have some creative and fresh take mixed with old standard as -PRON- would expect from the fox brand
a_few more question on what be what and -PRON- have -PRON- decision
-PRON- embark on the chicken wrap in prosciutto and -PRON- lady half take on the shrimp pasta dish
both come_out in a reasonable amount_of time and be present very well
the food be good nicely put together and creative enough that -PRON- feel -PRON- be not eat somewhere_else
the pasta dish -PRON- have be very unique in a red_sauce that be minty at first spicy then finish in a basil y sweetness
the verdict be still out but -PRON- be a cool dish and -PRON- girlfriend enjoy -PRON-
the prosciutto wrap chicken be very nicely craft on a bed of sauteed spinach with some fingerling potato that be delicious
the chicken be prepare properly although -PRON- think -PRON- would have be maybe a little more moist consider -PRON- be wrap in ham and so salty
-PRON- be expect a brine effect of moisture
either_way both meal be good but then again -PRON- seem_like -PRON- should be at $_17 each
neither will leave -PRON- with the overwhelming urge to go_back anytime_soon but -PRON- be not dissatisfied either
to make -PRON- a true date_night -PRON- finish -PRON- off with the nutella cake and vanilla gelato thing
-PRON- be very decadent the nutella cake portion be flour less so almost like a mouse top with the cold and creamy gelato and chocolate_cover espresso bean
there be a nice contrast between the flavor texture and even the temperature of the warm cake and the cool gelato
this would serve as the highlight in -PRON- opinion
so all in all north to -PRON- be like every other fox restaurant -PRON- be cool good consistent maybe a little overpriced for food that be slightly casual but -PRON- be good enough that -PRON- get away with -PRON- and -PRON- realize -PRON- be pay for the ambiance and experience too
-PRON- be another one of those place
-PRON- know -PRON- can get a good meal but leave -PRON- search for more if -PRON- like those rare find that provide -PRON- with culinary perfection at the same price or the complete package for slightly more 3-star be completely appropriate
-PRON- be good good enough that -PRON- will probably end_up there again but not good enough that -PRON- can_not wait for that time to come
nothing really blow -PRON- away in_term for food service quality ambiance or any_other intrinsic for that matter so -PRON- be not_sure -PRON- would deserve any more star -PRON- be a solid good
-PRON- always stay_at paris hotel and this be just a convenient place to get something without sit in
the food be great but the service be beyond horrible from the cook
the cashier be friendly and nice and fast but then -PRON- put the order in and -PRON- go to the cook -PRON- be another story
the cook be rude and very slow
-PRON- be like -PRON- hate -PRON- job and do_not want to be there help other in a hotel in_vegas that live on hospitality
awful service
the guy always find excuse to prevent -PRON- from pay by credit_card
food quality be nowhere near satisfactory
love the food portion
just make_sure to come when hungry
price be very_reasonable and service be great
every_time -PRON- request something the waiter be quick and happy to fetch
the hype be justify
this
be
coffee
-PRON- love subway restaurant but this one have to be one of the bad -PRON- have ever be in
maxwell be be worker and -PRON- be incredibly rude
not only do -PRON- make -PRON- wait for -PRON- to make the bread when -PRON- be the only one inside -PRON- also do_not ask of if -PRON- want -PRON- sandwich toast but precede to anyway
-PRON- also refuse to put extra cheese on -PRON- sandwich
then when the sandwich come_out of the toaster oven the cheese have slide off and -PRON- do_not do anything about -PRON- all the vegetable be old and lettuce browning -PRON- do_not have a lot_of the sauce
the worker be extremely_rude the entire time and not just to -PRON- but everyone that come in
-PRON- would figure in_las_vegas where there be always a lot_of people come in the subway would try to hire good employee and keep the ingredient fresh
$_18 for a strawberry rhubarb martini
-PRON- be hard to complain_about the price when -PRON- be oh soooo delicious
luckily -PRON- be a vegetarian
so -PRON- drink -PRON- steak budget
-PRON- will make -PRON- way back to this spot for -PRON- martini and mash_potato
this be a fun place for all family_member
-PRON- have activity for all age
-PRON- have so_much_fun for 2_hour
nought -PRON- pass off groupon
love -PRON-
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- have not be overly impressed_with cameo
overall -PRON- would describe the place as fine hence the 3_star
the pro -they offer a variety_of price_range for haircut -the facility be nice especially if -PRON- be get a spa service -free bang trim if -PRON- be a regular_customer -no hard sell on product -massage be usually average or above the con
-haircut be more like average or below whether -PRON- pay_$ 35 or $ 65
-service be a little pretentious -clos on sunday
great_job as_usual
this time of year scorpion be a problem and bulwark continually make_sure -PRON- home be protect
-PRON- know_why people come_here
-PRON- be because -PRON- want soup
and -PRON- be stay_at encore or wynn
the soup here be terrible
no flavor what so ever and service be not all that great either
when -PRON- be busy -PRON- completely be not attentive at all
-PRON- have to ask 2_3 time to get -PRON- waiter -PRON- do_not understand_why the other employee there do_not want to help -PRON-
-PRON- say -PRON- waiter will be right there
-PRON- be the same way for -PRON- bill
took forever
-PRON- avoid come_here for hungover food with -PRON- friend
pricey for something that be not so great be definitely a no thank -PRON- after 3 try
the food be not consistent at all
dislike place that can_not cook and just add spicy or sweet to the broth
convenience will not make -PRON- think -PRON- be good
rather drive or cab -PRON- to a good place
shame on me for not read the review first as state by other_review -PRON- a long process when -PRON- pull_up there be 2 car ahead of -PRON- after 15_min
-PRON- make -PRON- to the vacuum
now -PRON- go for the middle_of the road $ 19.95 wash with the rain protection another 5_min for the wash
now -PRON- park -PRON- vehicle in the sun because the car port be full of vehicle and only 4_people to dry
by the time -PRON- vehicle be do -PRON- be bad off than when -PRON- start now one big water spot and dirty rag wipe mark all over
for what
-PRON- be worth drive a little longer to the other car_wash be so worth -PRON- -PRON- leave with a clean vehicle
customer satisfaction be not this_company 's goal
moral of the story
read the reviews first and do_not go to superstar car_wash
have a small luncheon with friend
enjoy -PRON- cream spinach and brussels sprout
service be great and would_recommend to other
look_forward_to return soon
this be the small restaurant -PRON- have ever be to or see
despite that the malabar parotta similar to a naan bread be as good as -PRON- get
however the rest be not very good
-PRON- have an onion chilly uthappam rice lentil pancake
-PRON- be dark and nearly burn
-PRON- contemplate send -PRON- back
but -PRON- do_not want to risk piss off anyone
the over cooking make -PRON- dry and flavorless
$_10 of disappointment
husband try -PRON- and feel the same way about -PRON-
aside_from the food the people be friendly and pleasant
-PRON- use paper plate and plastic cutlery so try to cut the pancake with a plastic knife be a challenge almost impossible
the place be set_up like a fast_food restaurant
there be a garbage by the door
-PRON- be expect to remove -PRON- own dirty dish and toss -PRON- on -PRON- way out
-PRON- will probably go again -PRON- love the bread but next_time -PRON- will just tell -PRON- not to over cook the food
actually -PRON- think -PRON- be grill
there be no excuse for burn -PRON- so dark brown and dry
-PRON- be short of charcoal but really
there be only two other people in the restaurant that have already be serve at one table
so where be -PRON- attention
-PRON- could_not have be that -PRON- have too_many customer to handle
-PRON- have none
mid way_through -PRON- meal more people arrive
husband like -PRON- curried vegetable dish well enough
-PRON- taste -PRON-
-PRON- be okay
but -PRON- can_not say that -PRON- be anything special
great breakfast in a beautiful area of old_town
-PRON- coffee bar be very_nice service be spot on and the corn_beef hash taste just like -PRON- dad use to make -PRON-
the chef be walk_through the restaurant frequently to talk to patron
-PRON- can_not wait to go_back
-PRON- have be eye this truck the last few_time -PRON- have be to walnut wednesday
there be now 5 or 6 taco truck that frequent this event and the scene really need something new
from the moment -PRON- see this truck -PRON- think that be a damn good idea
-PRON- also notice that there be never a line and usually no one be wait
-PRON- be able_to walk right up and give -PRON- order which should have be a red flag
-PRON- be not_sure -PRON- really pull -PRON- off
-PRON- be a huge_fan_of asian food and -PRON- wish there be more truck gear towards that cuisine
the ingredient seem fresh the staff be friendly and -PRON- take credit_card
still blow -PRON- mind that there be food truck that do_not take card
-PRON- order the rice bowl at the recommendation of the person_who take -PRON- order
-PRON- order the caramelize pork but -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- get beef
which look_like ground beef
not that -PRON- would have matter -PRON- could_not really taste -PRON-
the rice bowl come with a slaw rice cucumber the meat and basically bbq_sauce mix with sriracha
this be serve in a small little container like the one -PRON- get a hot_dog in at the fair
-PRON- be a little shocked that this be $_9
the serve size be definitely inferior to that of the other truck in the area
-PRON- feel that the price be way off base for the quantity\/quality of food -PRON- receive
-PRON- need to either increase the portion_size or lower -PRON- price to around $_5
also -PRON- think the name be rather deceive
when -PRON- think of wok food -PRON- picture strip of beef noodle baby corn what ever genetic mutation that stuff be pepper some bean_sprout or perhaps even broccoli
this have none_of that
probably would not return to this truck
-PRON- be not terrible -PRON- just miss the mark
-PRON- have huge potential but currently -PRON- be mediocre at best
-PRON- like venezia 's for lunch the slice be huge the wing be some of the good and -PRON- do_not have to spend a lot
if -PRON- like ny_style_pizza -PRON- will enjoy venezia 's
-PRON- call -PRON- agent and when -PRON- discover water leak from -PRON- attic and -PRON- give some amazing advice
-PRON- be not direct to the claim department instead -PRON- suggest -PRON- call paul 's restoration and carpet
who offer to come_out the same_day to investigate the damage
rachel with state farm tell -PRON- to get an_estimate from -PRON- and if the work be less then -PRON- deductable not to file a claim and lose -PRON- claim free discount
-PRON- be so grateful that -PRON- help take_care_of -PRON- problem right_away and care enough to do what be good for -PRON- not just direct -PRON- to file a claim when the fix be less expensive then -PRON- deductable save -PRON- money

-PRON- baked goat_cheese dip appetizer be rich creamy and absolutely a must have
-PRON- have try the steak the chicken and salmon superfood
the steak -PRON- order medium_rare seem_like a little small or a portion but be actually really fill probably about_10 oz
the chicken be a huge serving
usually -PRON- be a_bit hesitant to get roasted chicken because -PRON- can be a bit_dry but not this_place
incredibly flavorful moist on the inside and really crispy skin
the salmon superfood be really well do and not fishy at all
-PRON- especially enjoy the quinoa pair
but that may just be because -PRON- love quinoa

-PRON- also see that -PRON- have a free check in sangria on_yelp so -PRON- do that
-PRON- have_no_idea -PRON- be a bogo sangria special
should have read -PRON- carefully when -PRON- click -PRON- on_yelp but -PRON- be ok although -PRON- have too_many drink
order two iced water free
-PRON- be a very enjoyable experience
fries and drink come fairly_quickly
-PRON- do watch the move at 11:45am on a sunday
so there be not many_people there
this be a pretty pricey theater
-PRON- would save -PRON- for a movie that -PRON- really want to watch
-PRON- come_here base_on the high_rating and volume of review
after the experience -PRON- now understand that people be probably more excited about the low price_tag rather_than a truly authentic and delicious food experience
first_off the service here be just terrible
-PRON- be seat and -PRON- take about_10_minute for anyone to notice -PRON- be even there
which be usually fine if -PRON- be have nice conversation with -PRON- date but in this situation -PRON- be hungry and -PRON- need -PRON- shahi paneer fix and -PRON- need -PRON- now
once -PRON- get -PRON- water -PRON- take another 5_minute for the person to come_back and take -PRON- order
-PRON- remember longingly star off into the distance await the return of -PRON- server eye the other client and note the status of -PRON- order
and then -PRON- sadly note other large_group who come in after -PRON- get -PRON- food first
ok what be the big_deal -PRON- ask
fine
maybe the food be so great that -PRON- be worth the bad service
-PRON- have be to some hole_in the wall dive_bar restaurant with food so good
-PRON- knock -PRON- sock off
but -PRON- be not
now before -PRON- get all critical about the food -PRON- think -PRON- should mention that hubby and -PRON- be season indian_food consumer
-PRON- be of indian decent and also regularly frequent top rat indian_restaurant in vancouver toronto ottawa and montreal
after all the anticipation the food finally arrive
all -PRON- recall be mine and hubby 's eye slowly meet over the shahi paneer dish with the same odd expression and look of confusion on -PRON- face
-PRON- be both think the same_thing
why do the paneer dish look_like scramble mucous
where do the traditional paneer cube in creamy sauce go
what cause -PRON- to meet such a blended fate
-PRON- hesitatingly poke around at the puddle hop hubby would be brave enough to try -PRON- first
luckily -PRON- vegetarian thali be up next so -PRON- would get to eat solid food instead_of the paneer mush hubby be newly fat with
the thali be forgettable not unlike the unforgettable mush paneer low price_tag or not
-PRON- do_not satisfy -PRON- indian_food fix and -PRON- likely will not return
-PRON- can eat healthy for a great price no chemical msg or fry crap
ok to start_off the other two review for this hotel be actually for the intercontinental on front street locate by the cn tower so -PRON- be technically the first to review this specific hotel silly tourist
-PRON- book -PRON- reservation through hotwire and if -PRON- be book a hotel through hotwire in_toronto and get a listing for a 4 1\/2_star hotel there be only one in this city
if -PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- be drive at here please go in the corner and fall on a dull sword
this hotel be locate just west of avenue rd
on the north side of bloor
-PRON- be directly across the street from the royal ontario museum
the room be very_nice the staff be very_friendly and professional and the hotel be locate within walking_distance of yorkville and all the shopping -PRON- could want
the hotel bar be a vodka bar call proof
-PRON- be pricey but very_nice and not so busy that -PRON- could_not sit in there with -PRON- daughter and have a_few drink after long day at the museum or about town
the food be good and also cleverly disguise
for_example there be barbq chicken drummettes 5 for $_15 and a trio of mini burgers chicken lamb beef for $_18
-PRON- joke as -PRON- order -PRON- that -PRON- have never pay_$ 33 for a burger and wing but_hey after three martini -PRON- do_not feel_like walk to mcdonalds
-PRON- would most definitely_recommend this hotel especially if book through hotwire which do_not allow -PRON- to book by hotel name but then there be always that 4 1\/2_star thing
this_place be awesome
-PRON- crepe be so delicious
-PRON- just wish this_place be not so_far otherwise -PRON- would be come_here every_day
as_far as drink go -PRON- try -PRON- taro boba and -PRON- be a_bit grainy
-PRON- be not_sure how else to describe -PRON-
-PRON- be stick to thai_tea
other_than_that -PRON- must_try -PRON- crepe
yummy
-PRON- go here on a saturday_afternoon while hang_out downtown
staff be friendly and attentive but the food be a little lacking
noodle be tasty but beef be chewy and not high_quality
for a $_15 bowl of noodle -PRON- would expect good quality meat
great stop for a quick bowl of noodle to keep -PRON- full while -PRON- be party nonstop in_vegas but not as good as -PRON- could have be
elizabeth be amazing
thank -PRON- for always be so accommodate to get -PRON- in and through when -PRON- check for those little bugger
-PRON- start go to bloorcourt after be disappoint with dundas west animal_hospital and then fraser macdonald the latter keep mix up the file of -PRON- cat and even after -PRON- point this out -PRON- leave message that -PRON- deceased cat need a check up when -PRON- obviously -PRON- mean the other cat
and -PRON- be so happy -PRON- change
-PRON- cat have have to stay_at bloorcourt on iv for a couple of day during which time -PRON- have deal with 3 different vet all who have all be so helpful kind and knowledgeable
and the receptionist be great too and obviously really love the animal bring in
amazing all around
awesome service
old_school video game and fair_price
who do_not love_this_place
take an interviewee here for a business dinner tonight
service be excellent food subpar
-PRON- lady have the bass and -PRON- hub have the pasta
-PRON- have crispy artichoke and an orange beet_salad to start
the artichoke be unimpressively prepared and the salad be so soak in dress that -PRON- could_not enjoy the flavor
the bass however be perfectly caramelize
unfortunately even the chocolate torte leave something to be desire
do -PRON- a favor there be lot_of great restaurant in_charlotte do_not_waste -PRON- money here
caveat
hub work locally and say breakfast and lunch item far surpass the dinner offering
do_not_know_what other have experience but this_place should consider hire a new chef
have dinner there tonight
the food be adequate
the service be terrible
after be seat -PRON- take 15_minute to get a waiter
15_minute to get a drink and then 40 min
to get -PRON- food and then 15_min
to get -PRON- check and -PRON- be not busy
will not be go_back
this be the first_time at nob hill tavern for -PRON- however -PRON- be the 4th michael mina restuarant that -PRON- have be too
unfortunately -PRON- be the bad and -PRON- will_never go_back
-PRON- be stay_at the mgm and have ticket to ka that night
so -PRON- want to eat somewhere close to the show so that -PRON- do_not have to rush through dinner
-PRON- reservation be at 7 pm and the show be at 9:30 pm and the theater be right around the corner less_than a 5_minute walk but the service be so horrendous that -PRON- do_not even have time for dessert and be still rush to get to the show right at 9:30
-PRON- be a tuesday_night during non peak season and be unlucky enough to be the guinea pig for a new waiter
-PRON- be -PRON- first night on the floor alone
do_not get -PRON- wrong
-PRON- understand everyone get nervous and may make mistake -PRON- first night out but this waiter keep make mistake all night 1
first -PRON- take -PRON- about_15_minute to even take -PRON- order
when -PRON- finally do -PRON- have ask -PRON- about a certain appetizer and -PRON- say that -PRON- have not taste that dish yet but -PRON- would find out and get back to -PRON-
well -PRON- never come_back to tell -PRON- so -PRON- end_up with no appetizer
2
-PRON- husband order the tasting_menu with the wine pairing
-PRON- first course come_out and be eat and -PRON- realize that there be no wine pair that come with -PRON-
have to ask the waiter about -PRON-
and then -PRON- get -PRON-
but so_much for the pairing since the course be already eat
3
-PRON- friend have order the filet and have ask for the sweet onion sauce to come on the side well another mistake the filet come with the sauce on_top_of -PRON-
-PRON- could_not wait for another steak to come since -PRON- do_not get -PRON- entree until 8:30_pm
remember -PRON- have ticket to ka for the 9:30 showing which -PRON- mention to both the manager and the waiter when -PRON- sit_down
4
there be 4 of -PRON- two couple so to make the billing issue easier -PRON- have ask the waiter for separate bill when -PRON- first order
-PRON- say no_problem sir but when the bill come -PRON- be not separate
-PRON- ask again and when the waiter bring back the separate bill yes -PRON- be separate but there be no price
-PRON- would have be nice if this mean that -PRON- entire dinner be comp but of_course -PRON- be not
with all of the problem that -PRON- experience new waiter or not
-PRON- would think that at a michael mina restaurant the manager would come over to apologize but that do_not even happen
very disapoint since -PRON- dinner for 4 cost -PRON- $ 600 + and that do_not even include dessert since -PRON- do_not have time to even order any
the food be tasty but not mind_blow enough to get the bad taste of such horrible service out of -PRON- mouth
sorry mr mina but
-PRON- wait staff need quite a_bit_more training before send -PRON- out on -PRON- own
and maybe -PRON- restuarant manager need some additional training also
absolutely_delicious food
the double smoke bacon be one of the good us of deceased pig -PRON- have ever try
a wonderful menu full of interesting and exciting creation that make for a noteworthy brunch
-PRON- be brilliant that -PRON- have to walk by the kitchen first
an_excellent way to be introduce to a foodie restaurant
the chef say hello which be also a nice_touch
the ambiance in the restaurant -PRON- though be somewhat lacking
the crowd feel somewhat like a norman rockwell painting come to half life
the place feel kinda like a goyisha version_of united bakers
pho nam must be short for pho nam man nal
oh no -PRON- do_not
oh yes -PRON- do
-PRON- be here for lunch_today
and -PRON- be so good
though -PRON- visit be around lunch time this_place be pretty empty which -PRON- would generally take as a bad sign but the glowing review this_place have let -PRON- know that -PRON- should not judge a book by -PRON- cover
the restaurant be large clean and bright -PRON- be sometimes hard to get all three of these thing with a restaurant
the hostess be pleasant as_well
-PRON- be very_attentive and sweet
-PRON- order the combination fry_rice and -PRON- guest the spring_roll and a noodle_dish
-PRON- both really_enjoy -PRON- dish
-PRON- ask for -PRON- rice to have an_extra bit of kick to -PRON-
and -PRON- be not dissapoint
the portion at this_place be also really large
-PRON- pretty_much stuff -PRON- face and look down and realize that -PRON- have barely make a dent in -PRON- lunch
-PRON- know_what -PRON- call that
lunch for tomorrow
hey
yes -PRON- love_this_place and -PRON- will certainly be back
this be a great barber_shop with friendly and skilled barber
-PRON- have plenty_of music to soothe the wait
-PRON- go here to see a musical
-PRON- be a beautiful place for theatre and musical due_to -PRON- very historic and glamorous look
admittedly -PRON- could do with a refurbishment but that may as_well take all -PRON- charm away
-PRON- particularly like the small binocular for rent mount to the seat in front of -PRON-
if -PRON- have long leg this may not be the place for -PRON- though as -PRON- be not_overly spacious
-PRON- have the best bbq beef rib -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- life
staff be friendly service be very good
-PRON- will be back real soon for those fabulous beef rib
when -PRON- come_here -PRON- tummy will need to be patient because of the long_wait
however to make -PRON- trip to the wynn buffet worth -PRON- make_sure to save the good for last
and what be -PRON- exactly
for -PRON- -PRON- be the grapefruit gelato
-PRON- come for lunch and the food selection be okay
-PRON- would have to say that the memorable dish that -PRON- have be at the omelette station
-PRON- be a shame that there be no spinach available even_though -PRON- be on the menu
but -PRON- be satisfied with -PRON- omelette nonetheless
the smoked salmon be delicious
-PRON- actually think -PRON- be cool how there be a congee station however -PRON- personally like -PRON- congee thick
the congee be a_bit watery for -PRON- taste and the rice be a_bit thin
-PRON- be a cheese fanatic
and -PRON- be so_excited to see a meat and cheese station when -PRON- first walk_in
-PRON- try each type_of cheese and only end_up disappointed
-PRON- be dry and bland
-PRON- cheesy heart hurt at that moment
all in all the grapefruit gelato make -PRON- stay_at the wynn buffet
-PRON- have the perfect ratio of that tart and sweet flavor
other flavor be delicious as_well espresso vanilla bean strawberry etc
very fast
all automatic do_not have to deal with anyone
clean car well and the light be a very cool touch
hubby order takeout from this_place and -PRON- come_back with one container of food
then tell -PRON- -PRON- pay over $ 102.00 for -PRON-
-PRON- have show -PRON- the bill because -PRON- do_not believe -PRON-
so after the shock of the bill -PRON- start on the food and -PRON- be a big disappointment
-PRON- love bbq and this be not good at all
-PRON- have some chicken_wing rib and the mac and cheese
so not worth the money or -PRON- time
do_not be deceive by the other_review
-PRON- just not good bbq
period
yum_yum yum -PRON- arrive and be promptly seat
friendly hostess
not at all but whatev
-PRON- do_not need that to enjoy -PRON-
waiter come by promptly and take -PRON- drink order
-PRON- ask for a kid menu and -PRON- bring back a piece_of paper with available item write by hand
-PRON- be out of -PRON- kid menu
a wave of panic immediately come over -PRON- as -PRON- realize this mean no crayon to entertain -PRON- little one until -PRON- food come
a_few round of -PRON- spy save -PRON-
the waiter come by to take -PRON- order and -PRON- make the big mistake of the night
-PRON- never come_back
okay eventually after a long long_time
-PRON- order pita pizza for the kid tasteless and bland but -PRON- eat -PRON- and -PRON- husband
and -PRON- share the chicken chipotle pizza and lavosh shawarma wrap
heavenly
-PRON- keep ooh and aah about how delicious -PRON- food be
only_complaint be that -PRON- burn the lavosh
so -PRON- have to pick the burn part off
oh another complaint
there be not any cheese on the pizza
but -PRON- still taste yummy
see a couple of plate pass_by that
-PRON- wish -PRON- would have order nachos and a fruit plate
-PRON- finish with the baklava
-PRON- both love -PRON- but -PRON- be really hard
since -PRON- be not a frequent baklava order girl -PRON- do_not_know if that be how -PRON- be suppose to be serve
after hack off piece -PRON- be reward with mouth water bite
yes the service be sloooooow and the lahvosh burn but -PRON- will return
-PRON- be great to have option for healthy delicious food
also fyi join -PRON- online club and -PRON- will send -PRON- a coupon for a free appetizer
-PRON- love free thing especially when -PRON- spartan meal come to $_30 small pizza wrap 2 kid pizza and water
call aha after -PRON- lose the key to the house -PRON- be rent while in lv on business
when -PRON- call -PRON- speak to bill the owner and tell -PRON- -PRON- dog be lock inside and -PRON- come immediately to get -PRON- back in the house
thrilled
-PRON- be not some sketchy guy
clean well speak reasonably_price
could_not have be happy
after 18 year in the valley -PRON- finally make the trek down to durant 's
first -PRON- will preface -PRON- review by state that -PRON- do_not stay for dinner
long_story_short -PRON- bail after -PRON- bring_out the bread basket
cut to the chase
con
enter through the kitchen be not the good marketing strategy when -PRON- kitchen really need a remodel
the entire place need one of those remodeling show to do a surprise make over
carpeted restaurant leave -PRON- customer wonder just how dirty that carpet be
a bar tender should know the wine_list or at_least be able_to muddle through a question about a bottle_of wine
bath room be a_bit tired and need a remodel
wait staff need some training a tad way to denny_'s casual for -PRON-
bread basket and vege plate need some work
if -PRON- be drop 300 buck for 2 people pick_up the level a_bit
small detail but the wine glass and glass wear need to be update
nothing bad that drink a 150 bottle_of wine out of a denny_'s type glass
silver wear be also right out of an institution
pro 's
wine_list be pretty_good with allot of great wine and reasonably_price too
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be go against the grain here with this review but -PRON- simply how -PRON- see -PRON-
-PRON- typically have in -PRON- steak_house rotation mastro 's ocean club bourbon steak
michael mina 's place and morton 's this_place
just be not in that league
while -PRON- will_admit -PRON- never even get to the dinner -PRON- simply make a judgment call that with all that -PRON- have see up to order the food would not have be that good to over come all the con
if -PRON- a 30 40 be or even 50 's couple look for a hip crowd and great atmosphere note to self
this be not -PRON-
-PRON- be not a huge food critic
to -PRON- -PRON- be more important to have a great atmosphere fun hip crowd
-PRON- get the whole old power lunch steak_house thing but eventually even the great need to earn -PRON- keep through something other_than -PRON- long lived reputation
-PRON- have try this twice because -PRON- first experience be great the burger be thick juicy tasty and do perfectly
the second_time -PRON- try -PRON- nothing be right
the burger be thin small dry and overcook even_though -PRON- have order the same_thing
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be the cook 's problem or -PRON- lack of training which would establish the necessary consistency for a successful restaurant
either_way -PRON- will not go_back
good inexpensive mexican_food in_phoenix
yes
-PRON- read that correctly
-PRON- be the place -PRON- take people to when -PRON- come to arizona to visit -PRON-
not fancy pant new mexico style food -PRON- can got o sierra bonita grill also 5_star for $ 25\/pp meal
this_place just deliver mexican_food like the 70 's only better
chips be hot and not greasy
two kind_of dip
-PRON- $_7 lunch_special be all uniformly good
try the chicken quesadilla lunch_special if -PRON- be feel bad or the $_8 shrimp enchilada in jalapeno butter if -PRON- be feel decadent or grill_chicken salad with tortilla soup more like stew here if -PRON- be feel healthy
on wednesday -PRON- must_try the good fish_taco in arizona
not fried
grilled tallapia type fish with a little cream sauce some shredded cabbage in a corn_tortilla
-PRON- go with coworker and -PRON- order 5 for $ 1.25 each and along_with the chip -PRON- be stuff to the gill and only spend_$ 5 plus tip
seriously
wednesday for fish tacos
remember
even if -PRON- be not usually a fan_of fish_taco
-PRON- be tacky decoration
-PRON- be cheap vinyl booth
and the service be not terrific secret if -PRON- be in a rush bring -PRON- bill to counter to pay do_not wait at the table
in a city of good mexican_food if -PRON- be look for entree less_than $_12 there be no good mexican_food in_phoenix
-PRON- try the islamic noodle as suggest
-PRON- be awesome
not a good place for an intimate conversation or deep debate unless -PRON- want to be yell over the other people cram in with -PRON-
great food
fast service
polite server
stumble across this little_gem while wait for -PRON- boyfriend to get -PRON- haircut next_door
-PRON- order a guacamole to share poblano and queso fresco guacamole bomb and short_rib taco skirt steak and fish_taco
omg soooooooo good
can_not decide which one be -PRON- favorite
the tortilla be all handmade and -PRON- can definitely taste the difference yummmm -PRON- will_definitely be come_back thank bruno
-PRON- be so frustrated with the service or lack of service that -PRON- just receive at this massage_envy
please keep in mind that -PRON- have be a faithful member for at_least the last 18 month at another massage_envy
-PRON- be not able_to get in to -PRON- regular massage therapist
so for -PRON- convenience -PRON- choose to go to a massage_envy location that be close to -PRON- home
-PRON- call to make the appointment with witness by the way earlier today
-PRON- expain when -PRON- call that -PRON- be in an_accident about_10 day_ago and just need a massage
yes -PRON- see a dr. for workman 's comp only -PRON- advise -PRON- deserve a massage
sorry -PRON- be in an_accident
-PRON- tell massage ency receptionist this
fast_forward to the appointment arrive as request 30_minute early as request for paperwork
complete say paperwork pay 10.00 extra for aroma therapy
-PRON- have 4 hour of credit on -PRON- account so use 1.5 credit for -PRON- intend massage
met krystal the massage therapist
after the initial pleasantry -PRON- begin to explain those area that be bother -PRON-
-PRON- be perfectly honest because that_s how -PRON- be
when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have be in an_accident -PRON- put -PRON- clip board down and say -PRON- can_not see -PRON- -PRON- will not take that liability" -PRON- should see if -PRON- could call -PRON- dr. to get a release
-PRON- response
-PRON- be 8:30 on a saturday_night -PRON- be quite sure -PRON- doctor albeit concentra be go to be available for a release
when -PRON- become evident that -PRON- much anticipated massage be not go to happen
-PRON- return to the reception area to get -PRON- money back for the aroma therapy and have -PRON- 1.5 hour of session return to -PRON- account
to -PRON- shock -PRON- be tell that that could_not or would not be do since -PRON- be a member of another massage_envy
-PRON- ask to speak with the manager but be advise the manager be not available
-PRON- be give the name of amanda nielsen who be the manager but would not be available until monday
as -PRON- continue to request at_least -PRON- 10.00 back another manager brittany be call and again advise the front office staff that there would be no refund
if -PRON- have request an aroma therapy and receive -PRON- without pay -PRON- would have be arrest for theft or shop lifting
but massage_envy can take -PRON- money and not provide anything in return and that be call business practice
because -PRON- be a member of another location
so for no massage -PRON- be out almost $ 100.00 explain to -PRON- how this be anything but bad customer_service all the way around
michael smith
these_guy seem very_nice and -PRON- come_out and give -PRON- a quote for stump grind
-PRON- have 2 tree that -PRON- have not cut down yet but be plan to upon receive the quote for the stump grind
-PRON- need to make_sure -PRON- could afford -PRON-
-PRON- receive a very_reasonable quote from harris and sons and go_ahead and cut the tree down and call -PRON- back to schedule a time for -PRON- to grind the stump a_few day_later
-PRON- speak directly with one of the guy and -PRON- say -PRON- would check -PRON- schedule for the follow week and call -PRON- back
no one call -PRON- back
-PRON- call again and this time -PRON- leave a message with -PRON- answering service
no one call -PRON- back
so -PRON- guess -PRON- need to find a new company to do the work
unfortunately -PRON- budget for the quote harris and sons provide and -PRON- be find that the work be much_more expensive
-PRON- wish -PRON- would not have cut -PRON- tree down-
-PRON- could have wait until next_year but -PRON- know the tree be decline and since harris and sons provide a reasonable quote -PRON- think -PRON- should get -PRON- take_care_of now
-PRON- give harris and sons one_star because while -PRON- appreciate -PRON- come_out and give -PRON- a quote in a timely_manner not return call or honor the quotes- be really crappy
-PRON- be feel pretty sad look_at -PRON- barren front yard with big tree stump stick out like eye sore
oh la la
j'adore cette boulangerie --le macaron ont été meilleur que
je ai eu en
dehor de_la france
this bakery be the good -PRON- have be into in the phoenix_area
-PRON- be worth drive to if -PRON- like french\/ swiss style chocolate and pastry or if -PRON- just want to try -PRON-
-PRON- go to napoleon to get birthday treat for -PRON- son 's_birthday
-PRON- discover macaron in paris last summer so -PRON- think -PRON- may appreciate some on -PRON- birthday
-PRON- be delighted --which make -PRON- happy
then -PRON- share -PRON- with -PRON- brother and -PRON- family who have never try french macaron and -PRON- love -PRON- too
go here
-PRON- will not be sorry -PRON- do
stop_by mid week for dinner and be surprised to see_how busy -PRON- be
-PRON- original 30 40_minute wait be reduce since -PRON- be willing_to fit 5 people at a 4 person table which work out
order appetizer and a variety_of special sushi_roll
generally the roll be good and fresh
-PRON- expect there to be a_bit_more ambiance but -PRON- be fairly simple close to fast casual than fine_dining
would_recommend for a casual meal but not necessarily casual price but probably not for a date_night
also ideal for group_of 3_4 as most table be small and -PRON- can_not make_reservation
this use to be oliver 's sophisticated bean
the espresso be still delicious food be good and good price now
the atmosphere be chill and cozy
good for get work do or hang_out with friend
be careful rent from this_location
the car -PRON- get have bed bug
after a 5 hour drive in the rental_car i be cover in bed bug bite classic breakfast lunch and dinner bite along the seat belt line
budget be not willing_to reimburse -PRON- after pay_$ 600 on bed bug dog to ensure that -PRON- do_not track any bug into -PRON- house or -PRON- family 's house
luckily -PRON- be bed bug free confirm that bed bug be from the car
after speak with the rep from this_location and the avis budget regional manager the company be not responsive or willing_to do -PRON- part in damage control
be very careful
okay -PRON- love buca
-PRON- be not little italy in lower manhattan or the bronx but the food 's great though not especially creative the service be fine and there be plenty_of parking love the spaghetti and meatball(s generally one 's enough
and -PRON- never share
in 2_month 3 x no salad dressing no coke products no bacon during breakfast service
this mcdonald_'s be great when -PRON- first open a year or so ago
now not so_much
the owners need to get a hold on management
management need to be train on how to order the correct quantity need for proper food service
run out of these thing regularly be not acceptable
each frustrated customer be a potential lose customer result in lose profit
management need to get a hold of cutsomer service because just like -PRON- be food service
-PRON- the pits c'mon now mcdonalds
yall need to rally
pull -PRON- together and get -PRON- run like -PRON- be when -PRON- first open
-PRON- neighborhood customer be root for -PRON-
-PRON- want -PRON- to do good
expensive and small_portion
-PRON- be a server and bartender
-PRON- go with -PRON- friend because of the great review but the review be obviously make by friend of the employee
the food taste great but -PRON- be small_portion
$_12 a plate for two bite small
-PRON- be a lite eater and only weigh 100 pound
so when -PRON- say small -PRON- mean small
wine be not on the list
but -PRON- order -PRON- anyways
-PRON- be 120 $
still hungry after pay so_much be insane
server be very very_nice and helpful and take off half the price for the wine so the bill come_out to around 100 dollar
good and service be phenomenal
but -PRON- be soooo expensive
-PRON- do_not recommend
castles n coasters be fun for a_few hour
short wait time in line consider -PRON- be a friday when -PRON- go
restroom have no door
-PRON- have black flap curtain like -PRON- use in grocery_store backroom freezer
$_25 a person include -PRON- 5_year old get -PRON- unlimited ride
-PRON- cost a little more to add access to miniature golf
small locker be available to rent for 50 cent
do_not lose the key or -PRON- will be charge_$ 10 to have -PRON- locker open over 250 arcade machine for the hardcore and family gamer
honestly -PRON- do_not try the food because -PRON- be expensive for hot_dog and drink
upon purchase ticket -PRON- get -PRON- hand stamp upon entrance
that stamp allow -PRON- to leave and re enter the park all day
there be plenty_of restaurant and fast_food chain around the park include the metro mall across the street
-PRON- can easily get something to eat from the food court and make -PRON- way back if -PRON- want to
the soda -PRON- provide be all rc brand cola
-PRON- fill fill -PRON- up for -PRON-
-PRON- also sell monster energy drink and vitamin water per vend machine only
splash down coaster be similar to splash mountain @disneyland
really fun
and -PRON- do get soak wet
desert storm be also fun -PRON- be -PRON- big roller coaster that have 2 loop if -PRON- remember correctly and only last about 20 second
however the wait time in line make up for -PRON- as -PRON- be extremely short
-PRON- have bumper boat that be fun if -PRON- have kid
-PRON- get on a_few other ride do_not remember -PRON- all by name though
the small go kart style car be ok
the only problem be that the steering wheel be tweak so that -PRON- can_not make full turn for safety reason so -PRON- be extremely hard on -PRON- wrist
after drive around for 5_min -PRON- be actually relieve cuz -PRON- hand and wrist be hurt from hold the steering wheel
overall this be not a bad place to have fun every now and then
most efficient government run establishment ever
seriously
why can_not the california dmv be like this
this be definitely something nevada have on cali
and a full snack bar sell even healthy snack like fruit salad
be -PRON- still at the dmv
every_single person -PRON- have meet here be super_nice and accommodate
-PRON- have have to borrow a screwdriver from the people at the vehicle inspection to take -PRON- license plate off then borrow -PRON- again to put -PRON- back on
-PRON- have have to wait for the california dmv to get back to -PRON- because -PRON- lose -PRON- registration and the woman help -PRON-
-PRON- name be marilyn and -PRON- be awesome go_above and beyond to make the process as smooth as_possible
even the tv have entertain content on -PRON- such_as trivium about celebrity go figure
a word of advice -PRON- can get -PRON- number then leave to get a smog_check across the street and come_back in time to get serve
-PRON- recommend auto tech on durango five_minute away
-PRON- have a yelp_deal where -PRON- get $_10 for $_25 which be how_much a smog_check cost
coincidence
that price be unheard of in california
anyway -PRON- be impressed
never do -PRON- think -PRON- would walk_out of the dmv not want to shoot -PRON- up
joke shout_out to marilyn
great place for a sandwich
-PRON- be the real deal pile with -PRON- favorite meat and veggie
-PRON- have the sparky a really great and flavorful sandwich with potato_salad
-PRON- highly_recommend stop if -PRON- be in the area
decent bruegger 's locate near the pitt campus on forbes
as such -PRON- tend_to be pretty busy during most_part of the day a little less clean than_most location
-PRON- do have -PRON- standard set of bagel sandwich cream_cheese and stuff that -PRON- can take to go or eat in assume -PRON- have the time to sit in do so most do_not
a suitable option for breakfast and lunch
-PRON- would go_somewhere_else for dinner though since -PRON- do_not think this_place be open during the hour that most would eat dinner at
highly_recommend
hard to find an honest auto repair shop
but these_guy exceed -PRON- expectation
like how -PRON- email -PRON- a description and photo to support what -PRON- recommend for device need
way overpriced
very unfriendly manager waitress do_not speak_english
food
-PRON- live for 2 year in korea and can tell -PRON- far below_average

not recommend will_never go to that place again
oh -PRON- my my
the carrot_cake be a must
so very moist and delicious
-PRON- would order the same_thing next_time and -PRON- never do that
-PRON- have be here for food and for drink
-PRON- think overall a 3.5_star but bump -PRON- up to 4 for atmosphere etc
-PRON- go with a group from work for lunch one day and -PRON- be able_to_help a group_of 7 of -PRON- and split -PRON- check which be so appreciate
the hamburger -PRON- get be ok -PRON- could_not taste the sauce on -PRON- though
the waffle
fries-
amazing
-PRON- just wish -PRON- would have be bring a tad quicker since -PRON- really be not that busy when -PRON- be in there
if -PRON- come on a thurs\/fri\/sat night good atmosphere busy and ton_of alcohol choice
if -PRON- like -PRON- beer this be a place to come and hang_out for awhile
gorgeous outdoor_patio and yummy breakfast food
coffee be great too
-PRON- have only be here for breakfast once but will_definitely be return soon
yum
-PRON- have the strawberry creme_brûlée waffle and -PRON- friend get the crab_cake egg_benedict
both plate be amazing
-PRON- waffle taste_like dessert and -PRON- could_not finish -PRON-
-PRON- taste -PRON- friend 's crab_cake egg_benedict and -PRON- be heavenly
-PRON- will order that next_time
as_far as drink -PRON- have a peach bellini and -PRON- friend try one of the bloody_mary
-PRON- be excited because -PRON- have five or six different kind_of bloody_mary to_choose_from
personally -PRON- be not -PRON- thing but -PRON- say -PRON- taste great
the bellini be sweet but -PRON- would_recommend get a double
-PRON- server be nice and attentive but not bothersome
-PRON- arrive relatively early around 915
so there be not any wait to sit_down but by the time -PRON- leave the entrance be full of people wait for table
the atmosphere of the restaurant be pleasant and hip without be too aggressive
unlike other place in old_town the music be not blast and -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be at a club for breakfast
-PRON- enjoy the food and will come_back soon
come_here on a friday_afternoon
the place be empty at first but then wave after wave of high_school student come pour in
-PRON- be like -PRON- be in a high_school cafeteria and the noise level be so loud -PRON- want to just leave
this joint be a_bit run_down and could really use an update
small but cozy at the same time
-PRON- believe this be a husband and wife operation
-PRON- be both very_friendly and easy to speak with
-PRON- friendliness give -PRON- a_bit_more confidence about the place
egg_benedict with salmon $ 11.99 come the home fry which -PRON- really_enjoy
the home fry be basically a whole potato with the skin which be cut into small cube
the egg -PRON- be poach really well and the hollandaise sauce be pretty_decent
big breakfast $ 11.99 3 egg 3 meat sausage ham bacon home fry buttered bread huge fluffy pancake and french_toast
-PRON- be so big that -PRON- come in 2 separate plate
everything taste good
bacon be extra crispy just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
a good breakfast place but honey b hives be still hand_down the good
3.5_star
full mark
for someone_who do_not gamble drink or smoke molv be the only place to stay in_vegas
-PRON- only minor complaint be a friendly young check in clerk who be a little too friendly with all kind_of question where be -PRON- from
what bring -PRON- to lv
etc
-PRON- know -PRON- be the american way
but -PRON- chap
that kind_of stuff would never happen at the mandarin in hong_kong which -PRON- use to frequent
this be a beautiful park
there be plenty_of space to play and picnic plenty_of picnic table a nice gym area for the kid dog run and a walking or jogging path
the parking_lot leave a little to be desire if there be more_than two dozen car there
this_place deserve ten star
this_place be absolutely_amazing for -PRON-
a female w little to no knowledge on automotive part mechanical issue shop etc
-PRON- be another language for -PRON-
and -PRON- be nice to be able_to go to one of these place and be respect and to be talk to in a friendly manner
so -PRON- be just a very_nice experience for -PRON-
very very_friendly and informative -PRON- be help out by two representatives
-PRON- have a bmw
so -PRON- be a little tough try to find windshield wiper 's there unfortunately have to go to two place
the first pair here do_not quite fit but -PRON- end_up find a pair that do in_fact fit
-PRON- be help by the manager there
-PRON- name be jovan extremely helpful go over and beyond to make_sure -PRON- be take_care_of and -PRON- definitely deserve a raise
thank guy
-PRON- do_not feel_like lvg
the hyatt airport -PRON- be tired of the less_than stellar room service
-PRON- order a 10 spinach feta pie fry mushroom mild wing tuscany chicken salad
the pizza wa the good thing -PRON- receive -PRON- be only fair
the crust be tasteless
the salad be a head of iceberg that be barely chop and barely fresh
the breading in the mushroom be like a hushpuppy
the driver leave -PRON- drink -PRON- tip -PRON- $_3 buck but -PRON- be not even friendly
-PRON- will not order from here again
-PRON- pay for the convenience and most of this food be go to go in the garbage
-PRON- do smell like -PRON- be go to be delicious but -PRON- be fair at good
third_time eat at this_place and both time -PRON- do_not have sushi
odd
no not really because -PRON- be know for -PRON- fry_chicken and oxtail fry_rice
the seasoning of the fry_chicken be to die for and that oxtail fry_rice tho
minus a star because -PRON- get 4 piece_of fry_chicken for $ 28
kinda much
but_hey -PRON- be vegas
and -PRON- be expect to spend an arm and a leg
yeah be go_back
because -PRON- love food
the beech tree be definitely an_excellent bar if -PRON- want to have a drink
amazing cocktail list
-PRON- would never have expect from this neighborhood
the cocktail serve here use fresh squeeze fruit juice and house make syrups bitter and grenadine
and -PRON- just love the cocktail -PRON- order which all prepare with care and skill
for beer lover there be beer from amsterdam beau 's left field and kawartha lakes available on_tap
-PRON- can even give -PRON- a taster before -PRON- commit
for wine lover there be wine available in glass from local and around the world
the beech tree be definitely an_excellent restaurant if -PRON- want to enjoy some well_prepared food
the food here be all seasonal and locally source prepare from_scratch that include the bread pickle vegetable sauce and the cure meat
cauliflower and stilton on toast $_5
chicken liver parfait with poach pear and toast $_11
a warm salad of smoke arctic char w\/ celeriac croquette quail egg wild rice and cider vinaigrette $_12 gnocchi with rosemary and parsnip $_16 slow braise lamb hot_pot with pickle vegetable $_13
the appetizer and main -PRON- try be all nicely present with interesting combination of ingredient and flavor
the complimentary mini peanut_butter chocolate torte be so rich and -PRON- be the perfect to end the evening
highly_recommend to give the beech tree if -PRON- be in the area
but remember to make a reservation as the restaurant be quite small and with limited seating
-PRON- have pretty_much everything -PRON- would expect in armenian market i like -PRON-
this_place will_likely never recieve -PRON- business again
seating and hostess be critical to the first_impression of an establishment and this_place be subpar in that aspect
-PRON- experience start_off on the wrong foot when -PRON- be seat outside in a corner in the blazing sun when there be plenty_of seat inside and outside that be not in the sun
-PRON- ask if -PRON- can move to a table at_least out of the sub and the hostess tell -PRON- the rest_of the table be for big party than 2 shortly_after -PRON- sit_down the hostess bring party of 2 to those table that -PRON- ask about
-PRON- be disgust at this type_of treatment and after -PRON- meal
-PRON- go to ask -PRON-
-PRON- say that those table have be reserve
-PRON- can definitely understand that
but why do_not -PRON- say that in the beginning rather_than say -PRON- be for big party
-PRON- also have an aloof attitude that -PRON- do_not appreciate
-PRON- ask to speak to the manager and -PRON- offer to take 20 off the bill after -PRON- have to ask for -PRON- some_sort_of rectification
-PRON- have always be impressed_with the establishment on the caesars property
so -PRON- be surprised -PRON- be treat that way here
as for the food -PRON- be decent but really overpriced
-PRON- be pay for the novelty
san tan ford be an_absolute mess
-PRON- family buy 4 yes four vehicle from here
2 have never have any issue aside_from the mandatory safety recall
mine however have both be absolute nightmare
the first vehicle be a 2012 ford focus mark as a certified pre own
while -PRON- be aware that a dealer do_not have to show -PRON- the carfax by law -PRON- would have be nice to have be show -PRON- especially_since -PRON- be a first_time buyer
and -PRON- have ask for -PRON-
-PRON- do_not want to screw -PRON- into a junk lemon
-PRON- find out later that the first focus -PRON- purchase be beat up like none other in california
-PRON- end_up run the carfax -PRON- to try and understand_why the car do_not like to run and why san tan ford be avoid work on the focus
if -PRON- have the chance to go_back and re do the deal -PRON- would have run as far_away from that dealership as_possible
but of_course -PRON- get angry instead_of use -PRON- head
-PRON- take the car back explain -PRON- issue with -PRON- and tell -PRON- -PRON- could have -PRON-
at that point -PRON- do_not_care if -PRON- affect -PRON- credit in anyway shape or form
and what do -PRON- know
the same guy that sell -PRON- -PRON- first three car swoop in the save the day
with being as distraught as -PRON- be -PRON- allow -PRON- to sucker -PRON- into another heap of junk certified pre own focus
-PRON- should have know good but -PRON- mess_up by let -PRON- use -PRON- snakey dealer tenancy and -PRON- get -PRON- into an even big mess
-PRON- can_not even begin to tell -PRON- the number_of time -PRON- have be stick at that shop
each_time -PRON- deny -PRON- a loaner or a rental
exactly how be -PRON- suppose to get to work to pay for the piece_of crap if -PRON- can_not get there on time
-PRON- have since take -PRON- focus to other ford dealer and -PRON- have treat -PRON- like such royalty
when -PRON- make_an_appointment -PRON- do_not hold -PRON- car for a week before even look_at -PRON- and -PRON- make_sure -PRON- be able_to get around and do what -PRON- need to
the problem just never end
-PRON- know car be not problem free but when -PRON- be the same issue over and over and over again there be only two reason for -PRON- 1
san tan do crap work or 2 san tan lie and do_not do any work at all
-PRON- will_never ever recommend anyone to come to this shady hole of a dealership
selling car be not about who -PRON- can screw the bad into a vehicle
-PRON- really never should have switch from dodge to ford
at this point -PRON- would have even buy a chevy
never again will -PRON- buy a ford especially not from this_place
amazing food
everything seem well think out the chef must have an_excellent pallet
great friendly service
another night that do_not_disappoint
the food be unbelievably delicious
from appetizer to salad to main dish
all be out of this_world
the owner be great to talk to and chef matt be at every table
-PRON- would_recommend this restaurant to everyone -PRON- will not be disappoint
like this_place
food be pretty_good which be why 4_star drink and service be 5_star for sure not too pricey by any mean
the patio be great
the firepit be lavarock or something similar and really nice
hand_down -PRON- favorite shop in the midw
clean friendly and just overall the good -PRON- have see
the only place -PRON- go for ink
-PRON- have really_enjoy -PRON- visit here the food have be delicious and the service have be exceptional
-PRON- highly_recommend ask for mandi at the bar -PRON- truly make the difference with -PRON- great service attitude and recommendation
-PRON- can tell -PRON- take_pride_in -PRON- work and -PRON- amplify the experience
-PRON- recommend the eggplant fry and grill wing with the wasabi ranch
-PRON- be awesome
this be quickly become -PRON- favorite spot in downtown chandler
good stuff
on -PRON- way home want to get something to eat during -PRON- flight
come_across the great american bagel
service be quick and friendly
price be a_bit high but_hey -PRON- be the airport
-PRON- bagel be good
do_not expect ny bagel but still quite tasty
nice option to have
food steak salad salmon with asparagus and kid spaghetti with meat sauce
food be just ok
-PRON- daughter do_not like -PRON- spaghetti
-PRON- taste -PRON- and the noodle be overcook
-PRON- steak be cook_perfectly on -PRON- salad but the rest be meh
ambiance nicely decorate
service attentive
location conveniently in_town center
too_many other option out there so probably will not revisit
ghee in all of the vegetarian dish make -PRON- not vegan friendly
owner or operator not willing_to make without ghee
vegetable oil cost less and be likely good for -PRON- so why not make the exception for vegan
the menu further state that -PRON- will make -PRON- any curry if -PRON- ask even if -PRON- be not on the menu
apparently -PRON- can_not make one without ghee
no money from -PRON-
how can -PRON- go_wrong_with a buffet with an endless supply of a large variety_of sushi and a chocolate fountain
-PRON- do have to say the warning sign on the table be a_bit much
-PRON- know people do waste a lot_of food at buffet but -PRON- be not welcome to be threaten with be charge for unfinished food
-PRON- be a buffet and sometimes -PRON- take thing to try that -PRON- absolutely do_not like
-PRON- be not go to eat -PRON- just because of -PRON- threat
-PRON- be in the area and convince -PRON- husband that -PRON- should finally try this buffet
-PRON- be a friday_night and while -PRON- be crowd -PRON- be not overwhelmingly so as the table be well space out
-PRON- be in the mood for sushi
so -PRON- start there
there be about_10 type_of roll four of five type_of piece and four type_of sashimi
-PRON- also have the sauce to add if -PRON- want to
none_of the roll or piece -PRON- eat be out of this_world or extremely memorable but -PRON- be tasty
most have at_least one type_of sauce on -PRON- though so if -PRON- be not a fan_of sauce on -PRON- roll -PRON- will not like this sushi
aside_from the sushi -PRON- also have a selection of the typical chinese buffet fair
-PRON- husband try a good number_of those dish and again say -PRON- be tasty but nothing overly memorable
-PRON- do have a_few dim_sum option which be a nice_touch
overall -PRON- be pricey around $_20 per_person but if -PRON- go_somewhere_else and get an_appetizer salad entree and dessert -PRON- would be pay at_least that if not more
große recht klar strukturierte messehallen die zudem ordentlich an den öffentlichen nahverkehr s bahn flughafen angebunden sind
per bus oder pkw ist die anreise ähnlich bequem dank eigen autobahnausfahrt und sehr großem parkhaus
tickets für die messe können be ich sehr angenehm finde mittel ec karte auch direkt be sb terminal in der eingangshalle gezogen werden
zu den kritikpunkten
die gastronomie ist höchst mittelmäßig und das personal strahlt eine nahezu perfekte
lustlosigkeit aus die man sonst selten erlebt
die parkhausgebühr ist ziemlich happig + 3 euro\/stunde
-PRON- recently_purchase a use car from audi north scottsdale

-PRON- decide to high tail -PRON- when -PRON- start to get pack

-PRON- have be come_here for since 2012
everyone be wonderful -PRON- all equally do a great_job
for -PRON- the pizza be too_expensive and and the flavor too exotic
for_example -PRON- try the pear gorgonzola pizza

the sauce be barely warm

-PRON- be not_sure what would make -PRON- pass on the project without give an explanation but -PRON- find the whole affair to be bizarre and unprofessional
of_course any contractor have a choice not to take the project just like -PRON- have the choice to post on the internet about how weird the whole interaction be
perhaps -PRON- do_not think -PRON- could make enough money on the project or something
whatev -PRON- be though -PRON- would have appreciate know_what -PRON- issue be with -PRON- house -PRON- family
-PRON-

-PRON- decide to go early ie 5pm for dinner and still have to wait a good 20_minute before get seat
of_course -PRON- have to try -PRON- duck which be as expect good
the skin be very crispy and the duck -PRON- be tasty
the presentation of the flour wrap be different and interesting but the wrap -PRON- be kind_of dry
-PRON- have all the standard side condiment that -PRON- would expect for the duck but if -PRON- want more there be a charge
-PRON- also try -PRON- dumpling where be very standard
-PRON- can get good northern style dumpling at many_other dumpl restaurant in the gta
-PRON- wrap -PRON- -PRON- meal with a cold noodle and fry veggie which be both pretty_good although nothing to rave_about
overall -PRON- would_recommend this restaurant if -PRON- be not for the ridiculous wait
-PRON- do_not think there be anything that extraordinary here that -PRON- would wait 40 + minute in line for
as -PRON- be leave the restaurant after -PRON- meal -PRON- have to weave -PRON- way towards the door -PRON- guess -PRON- should be happy with -PRON- initial 20_minute wait

-PRON- get brown_rice with salmon and octopus all the veggie goodness and the mirin garlic_sauce

the building -PRON- be lot_of fun
-PRON- have -PRON- ice_cream flavor write on a giant wall in chalk
the staff be friendly and -PRON- be a large space but -PRON- table and chair be not quite enough to keep up with the line of people
on to the ice_cream -PRON- be so impressed_with the selection of flavor -PRON- have
there be ton to_choose_from
-PRON- husband get an ice_cream cookie sandwich literally two cookie with ice_cream sandwich in and -PRON- get a cone with mixed flavor
coconut be out of this_world
-PRON- be a little disappointed with the key lime pie -PRON- be crumbly not creamy and be a little too lime zesty which be why -PRON- review be for 4.5_star not 5
the other issue be the portion_size
while -PRON- be never oppose to large quantity of ice_cream these portion be so huge that -PRON- husband could_not even finish -PRON-
there be too_much ice_cream between the cookie to be able_to eat -PRON- as a sandwich
-PRON- have lot_of different cup size so -PRON- do_not have to get a lot but -PRON- do_not really have a choice with the cookie sandwich or the waffle cone
again no way that would deter -PRON- from go again but -PRON- can certainly be overwhelming
-PRON- be good to see homemade\/local ice_cream shop around here
-PRON- be a refreshing change from ben and jerry 's
thanksgiving dinner really good service

$_15 for a pretty terrible breakfast quesadilla
there be virtually no flavor -PRON- bite_into a lot_of chicken fat which -PRON- be personally not a fan_of the thought of -PRON- leave -PRON- gag all day
the upside of that meal be the side salad the only_thing -PRON- enjoy of both -PRON- meal
-PRON- boyfriend get the west_coast toast which be good_than -PRON- but still not that flavorful
lastly the home fry have absolutely no flavor
perhaps -PRON- choose the wrong item but when leave -PRON- wish -PRON- have opt_for the eggsmart next_door
oh_yeah and a cup of coffee will set -PRON- back three dollar
sorry if -PRON- sound bitter but after spend so_much this_place leave -PRON- really unsatisfied and really unimpressed
-PRON- definitely will not be return

hash_brown be cook nicely
$_16 seem may seem a ittle extensive but include meat egg bread hashbrown and two beverage juice as_well_as a hot beverage of -PRON- choice
-PRON- would never call -PRON- an exceptional value but -PRON- be one of the good room service breakfast -PRON- have have
someone on the staff be nice enough to call and ensure -PRON- food be deliver and that -PRON- enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- also be nice enough to pick_up the tray shortly thereafter so -PRON- would not be clutter up the room or the hall
-PRON- be disappointed that -PRON- do_not make -PRON- to the top of the rock as many review indicate that -PRON- a nice way to relax without have to leave the property
one minor thing that be miss from the room be a directory detail local attraction and information regard the property
a simple card detail room service option and the tv channel be present but -PRON- be always nice to learn more about the area come from out of town
this be a very minor detail however and -PRON- would absolutely stay_at this property again give the opportunity

as a cwru student there be hardly any asian restaurant close by to start out with and this little bakery be cheap and delicious

price be average and the fish quality be far_superior to any_other sushi place that -PRON- have be to in mesa
the inside be a_bit small but luckily this spot be still a_bit of an undiscovered treasure
so -PRON- be never too_crowded
this_place be freak unbelievable
hands down one of the good meal -PRON- have ever have
ever
-PRON- waltz into this_place on a thursday evening expect a long_wait
instead -PRON- be seat almost immediately and be happy to be seat in the area near the bar
-PRON- waitress be friendly and helpful when -PRON- have menu and wine question

the star at this restaurant be truly the sauce and the meatball
the sauce -PRON- have on -PRON- angel hair pasta be marinara and be just out of this_world
the meatball be fantastic and melt_in -PRON- mouth heaven
-PRON- can_not wait to go_back to rao 's the next_time -PRON- be in_vegas
-PRON- buy -PRON- wedding ring along_with an accompany sport ring to go along_with -PRON-
these_people be the true definition of customer_service

-PRON- will make all of -PRON- future jewellery and watch purchase from -PRON-
-PRON- stay_at the hotel all the time
and -PRON- love -PRON-
however the hooters restaurant be aweful
the manager be grade a bologna
the hostess do_not_know anything
-PRON- be tell that -PRON- could bring alcohol in but then the manager come up to -PRON- and impolitely mention -PRON- be not allow to open anymore beer bottle
which -PRON- have purchase from the restaurant early morning
-PRON- do_not_know the hiring process at this restaurant but -PRON- should reconsider the people -PRON- hire
-PRON- work at a very upscale restaurant and -PRON- can promise -PRON- -PRON- would never treat -PRON- guest the way -PRON- have be treat here
then again -PRON- be hooters
first this_place have a lot_of review and -PRON- may want to just skip this one
over all this_place suck in -PRON- humble opinion
-PRON- come_here for one thing seafood
-PRON- end_up eat more as -PRON- will write about
the crab be serve all cold
-PRON- slice everything in half the long way
to be honest -PRON- miss the stone age feeling of rip the limb apart and hear that perfect snap and have the joy of a perfect piece_of crab come_out in one piece
do -PRON- know_how that perfect crab taste
-PRON- know the natural salty sweetness -PRON- be talk_about
the same with those perfect shrimp
well -PRON- will not find -PRON- here
oh the horror of -PRON-
the crab be so salty that -PRON- even go as_far as open up -PRON- netflix app on -PRON- iphone and be go to cancel tap anymore deadliest catch episode
this seam to be do on purpose
-PRON- have never have crab that salty before
not even at those cheap chinese_restaurant that want -PRON- to stop eat be that salty
what about the shrimp -PRON- ask
well -PRON- should have forget about that
-PRON- be quite the opposite
no taste at all
why bother get cholesterol when there be no taste
so now out of desperation -PRON- decide to try other food
at first glance this_place truly have nice food sex appeal
-PRON- food lover know_what -PRON- mean
when -PRON- decide to delve a little more into what there be and how -PRON- taste ugh
-PRON- have chicken soup here
if -PRON- mama make soup like that well -PRON- advice would be to get a new mama
next be deep_fry chicken which be batter with matzo of all thing
-PRON- be not_too_bad
then again even old country buffet can make a half way decent piece_of deep_fry chicken
the seaweed_salad be a little on the sweet side but ok
the vegetable roll be sort_of crunchy oily mush yuck
someone write nice thing_about the black angus burger
really
really
r e a l l y
-PRON- need to come to buffalo and -PRON- can send -PRON- to a nice pub that would rock -PRON- world if that be how -PRON- think
that poor cow die for this
-PRON- be guess -PRON- may of have alzheimer and mad cow disease and do_not even know -PRON- be cattle in the first place
in case there be a lawyer read this
-PRON- am joke
jeez
-PRON- just spend_$ 43.23 w\/tax and be starve
so -PRON- go to the salad_bar to have caesar_salad at_least that be what -PRON- call -PRON- on the name tag
-PRON- think -PRON- write enough for now
just go_somewhere_else and spend the money
either that or put -PRON- all on 24 and wish for the good
the brewer
the chef
masterpieces
from the roosevelt red to the mb wings to the olives and burgers to the house ipa
absolutely great
-PRON- have the phoenix cake company create a cake for -PRON- two year_old with pingu as an adornment on_top
not only do pingu look realistic -PRON- be 3d
and -PRON- be only charge for the 2d price
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_company for any event require any type_of cake
use to love_this_place
however the last three visit -PRON- sit_at the bar with -PRON- boyfriend to grab a cocktail and wait minimum 20_minute each_time
never wait on

lettie color -PRON- hair nice job and give -PRON- a fabulous cut
-PRON- really know_what to do with curly hair
-PRON- only have to put a little product in -PRON- hair this morning no hair dryer flat iron curling iron
everyone -PRON- have see at work this morning have tell -PRON- -PRON- hair look great
low effort and high reward
what more could -PRON- want
always great
mimosas be really good but the price(s of a large catch -PRON- by surprise after see the sign for -PRON- mamosa special which must be small
main meal or brunch be all fantastic
so -PRON- hear that -PRON- just open and -PRON- really want to check -PRON- out
-PRON- come on a friday_night
-PRON- be pretty busy
but -PRON- think -PRON- get lucky
and -PRON- get a seat_right_away for the three of -PRON-
-PRON- order the sandia rita
this be quite tasty
not too strong
-PRON- also order the carne_asada tostadas
this be good but a_bit spicy for -PRON-
and -PRON- think -PRON- put too_much lettuce on -PRON-
if -PRON- look_at -PRON- picture -PRON- look_like a salad on a tostada
-PRON- will not be able_to see any of the other ingredient on there
-PRON- think the food be good but -PRON- be really loud inside
and -PRON- do_not like that -PRON- charge -PRON- for every little thing
for_example -PRON- will usually get free chip and dip
but if -PRON- end_up want more salsa -PRON- will charge -PRON- $_4
-PRON- fiancé also want ranch for -PRON- fry and -PRON- want to charge -PRON- $_2
what
-PRON- waitress end_up give -PRON- to -PRON- for free

the staff here be very_professional and provide great service and personal opinion of what dish be good
-PRON- ask about the chocolate bacon waffle $ 11.95 and the server highly_recommend -PRON- and be one of -PRON- favorite
so that be what -PRON- get
who care if the combination sound funny
the mix of sweet and salty flavor be superb
-PRON- girlfriend think -PRON- be interesting too and be skeptical to try -PRON- dish but when one be brave enough and think -PRON- be good the other follow and decide to give -PRON- a shot

thursday_night -PRON- decide to head up to the foundation room to grab a drink and the overly pretentious snot at the front_door take a look down -PRON- nose at -PRON- and say -PRON- can let -PRON- up now but -PRON- may have to ask -PRON- to leave later
for wear jean and a shirt
regardless of the treatment -PRON- receive downstairs -PRON- decide to go up anyways
-PRON- be a gorgeous view and the bartender be great but when -PRON- be ask to not sit on the couch because -PRON- be reserve for member only -PRON- really should have more_than about_15 people in the place to make -PRON- snobbery a tad more legitimate
-PRON- do have a nice big room but -PRON- be quite dark in_term_of decor and start to show wear and tear
the wifi connection be terrible to the point that friend of our get -PRON- $ 25\/day resort_fee refund to -PRON- for all 3 day because no one could fix -PRON-
in short -PRON- trip be ruin for the first few day
-PRON- will_never ever stay_here_again and can_not recommend -PRON- to anyone
spend -PRON- money elsewhere
first_time here
the decor and service be standard
come_here for -PRON- lunch bento_box -PRON- order the vegetarian one and -PRON- be alright
-PRON- like the glass noodle and potato that be in -PRON-
the good part of the box would be the sushi with the crispy edge imo
-PRON- do_not give -PRON- enough wasabi in the bento_box as -PRON- would be do with the amount provide in a hurry
all -PRON- have to do be ask then -PRON- will give -PRON- more_than_enough
would be back again next_time -PRON- be in the mood for sushi

the food -PRON- be fine exactly_what -PRON- would expect from a perkins
-PRON- try one of -PRON- new omelet and -PRON- be surprisingly tasty
-PRON- have that problem where -PRON- be too full to eat more but want to keep eat
the service however leave much to be desire
the first_time -PRON- go be on a sunday around noon so -PRON- be pretty busy
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- stand in front of the podium wait for someone to come to put -PRON- name on the list
when someone finally come -PRON- first take the name of someone_who have come in after -PRON- like -PRON- be not even there
-PRON- take a while to be seat but that be understandable since -PRON- be about time for sunday_brunch
the second_time be again on a sunday around noon but -PRON- be not near as busy
-PRON- waitress take -PRON- order promptly but afterwards the quality of service plummet
-PRON- water_glass be empty for at_least 15_minute before get a refill twice
the waitress have walk past -PRON- table many_time but do_not even look_at -PRON- to see_how -PRON- be do
-PRON- food take_forever to come and -PRON- understand there be five of -PRON- so that can take a while but this be ridiculous
and the waitress do_not say a thing the whole time
when the food do come -PRON- be warm so at_least the meal -PRON- be good
-PRON- ask for a box but -PRON- never come
-PRON- end_up ask for one at the counter -PRON- to avoid wait probably another half_hour
overall -PRON- waitress stop at -PRON- table maybe five time total and never apologize for the long_wait or even notice that -PRON- be pretty upset with -PRON- service
in_addition several of the other employee be argue loudly in earshot of customer which -PRON- think be pretty unprofessional
-PRON- can_not say -PRON- would_recommend go here and if -PRON- do expect to wait

only drawback be -PRON- get a_bit loud as noise carry well
-PRON- have a 3:45pm pick_up from lenoir nc for a flight out of charlotte at 6:25pm
at 3:20pm -PRON- get a voicemail say there be an_issue and that the driver be in an_accident
-PRON- call at 3:45pm and be tell a driver would be to -PRON- in 30_minute
when -PRON- become upset the dispatcher put -PRON- on hold for over 10_minute
-PRON- hang_up and call back and another dispatcher tell -PRON- the driver have a flat tire but a car be on the way to -PRON- for a 4:30 pickup
when -PRON- ask to speak to the owner -PRON- be place on hold for another 15_minute then tell a car would be to -PRON- at 4:45pm
since there be no other taxi service in lenoir -PRON- have no choice but to wait
net net an actual driver do_not pick -PRON- up until almost 5:10pm
and -PRON- miss -PRON- flight
-PRON- be then tell the original driver do_not show_up for work
-PRON- advice take another charlotte car service
there be many
the owner apologize and of_course say -PRON- would credit -PRON- the fare after -PRON- insist -PRON- do but almost 1 1\/2_hour late and consistent miscommunication be just unacceptable
taco loco be a great little taqueria with a spicy flair
-PRON- taco be amazing chock full of cilantro onion diced tomato and lettuce and if -PRON- go on tuesdays or thursdays chicken and beef taco be only 99 cent each
taco loco truly shin however if -PRON- go deeper into the menu
the burrito and chimichangas be some of the good in_town especially if -PRON- order -PRON- with the more traditional chorizo or al pastor meat option
be prepared to pay a little more if -PRON- want rice and bean on the side of some dish but then again this be a taqueria not a sit_down place
and be sure to grab some hot_sauce from the little fridge next to the counter where -PRON- pick_up -PRON- order
most of the food will already be spicy enough for most people but if -PRON- like -PRON- food so hot -PRON- make -PRON- cry grab the red_sauce in the transparent container
bottom_line for what -PRON- be a little taqueria where -PRON- order -PRON- food at one end of a counter and pick -PRON- up on the other taco loco be a superb speciman
the food be spicy full of fresh cilantro and prepare fast right there in front of -PRON-
zunächst mal der goldene adler ist ein ordentlich lokal
aber um seinem anspruch gerecht zu werden fehlt stet ein quentchen
jakobsmuscheln die man riecht bevor sie den
tisch erreichen rehgoulasch das etwa zu trocken aber dafür
kräftig gewürzt ist
und ein nachtisch der auf ganzer front enttäuschte
alle nicht wirklich schlecht aber auf keinen fall den selbst gestellten anspruch treffend
gute auswahl an offenen weinen wenn auch zu happigen preisen
der service war trotz de brechend
vollen lokals schnell und freundlich
eine zweite chance wird es geben aber erst -PRON- be neuen jahr
insgesamt ist das
preis- leistungsverhältnis nicht gut
toasted toast toast
word of the day for sure
the toast wrap be awesome
-PRON- go with the thai chicken and -PRON- be a great combo with wonton chicken and a thai sauce that have nice heat
perhaps a little too_much sauce overall
side choice include chip a banana or an apple
-PRON- also get a smoothie for $_3 with a food purchase which be the way to go
the smoothie be not as good as carolina smoothies but good_than the king for sure
parking can be a hassle of_course
but -PRON- probably figure that out base_on the address
this_place be dead but -PRON- be 1:30 pm
the server do_not give -PRON- name but be nice
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be in a hurry and get the chicken gyro quickly
-PRON- be stuff full and tasty though not very warm
the server nicely offer to sub spring mix for the iceberg lettuce which make -PRON- more flavorful
-PRON- come with a creamy cucumber sauce which be nearly tasteless
-PRON- would put dill in the sauce
-PRON- would come_back and have this or -PRON- wing which be pretty_decent
iwould suggest that the server hand the change to the customer
-PRON- be -PRON- pet peeve
this review be mainly on the dining_experience
2_star for the view 2_star for the meal -1 star for the wait to get -PRON- food
overall -PRON- have a great experience here -PRON- have a table of 13 and most everyone order the voodoo menage et trois 6 oz
premium petite filet half cold water lobster_tail and grill mexican white prawns
-PRON- all seem to love -PRON-
-PRON- personally order the classic lobster thermidor maine lobster with lump crab meat with a lobster tarragon sauce which be absolutely mouthwater deliciousness
-PRON- be full halfway through and could_not help -PRON- in finish -PRON- because -PRON- be so rich and yummy
huge piece_of lobster and fresh crab meat
a couple of other have the 14 oz berkshire pork porterhouse with forest mushroom creamed grits and pork jus
this thing be massive and well_worth -PRON-
-PRON- also have the poached asparagus and lemon aioli nom nom and the crispy coconut sugar cane shrimp even better
the wait time be a_bit of time to get -PRON- food but well_worth -PRON-
-PRON- go upstairs and get a vip table which host a beautiful view of the strip
-PRON- think this be one of the most beautiful view along side the mandalay view
great hotel stay from friendly reception staff to helpful housekeeping super speedy valet staff helpful luggage personnel and resourceful concierge
-PRON- have provide -PRON- all with during a wonderful stay
4star on the staff alone
the room be ample in space clean and great view
the kitchenette be a plus but -PRON- do have to request for pots\/pans\/utensil
the coffee maker should have be make available but -PRON- do have to request and pay for the rental during -PRON- stay
great tub to soak in though
do_not expect a casino on -PRON- ground but aria and bellagio be literally just a walk across back and front
accessible via tram or short cross
the good part about this hotel be that -PRON- can bring -PRON- family dog
regardless of size
dog be everywhere in the lobby just not_sure if ok in the room which -PRON- forget to ask
-PRON- definitely would come_back and stay
-PRON- be like a permanent food truck anchor in a parking_lot
-PRON- find -PRON- strange but nonetheless -PRON- pass -PRON- twice a day to and from work so curiosity get the good of -PRON- and -PRON- stop here
-PRON- try the croqueta -PRON- find -PRON- gross
the outside be crunchy but the inside be like a soggy cream of ham soup that be the good way -PRON- can describe -PRON-
the empanada be so so -PRON- be overprice for what -PRON- get
-PRON- throw both of -PRON- out
the burrito be pretty_good -PRON- get a shrimp burrito even_though -PRON- think -PRON- be take a huge risk on either too little or crappy shrimp
luckily neither be an_issue
-PRON- be willing_to try the taco or another burrito next_time but -PRON- would advise to skip the tapas
to be perfectly honest -PRON- only be to the sahara hotel once so when sls be be make -PRON- really be not too upset like many_people be
of_course the location be pretty messed up no_matter_what -PRON- put in this_location
-PRON- be at the end of the strip and new and improved casino be be build faster than a blink of an eye
not many tourist get to walk down this far
-PRON- have stay_at this hotel a couple time
once for a yelp event which be amazing
shout_out to nate one more time
another time be for nieves d. 's bachelorette_party
-PRON- get the big room -PRON- offer
and to be honest -PRON- big room be really not that big
but needless_to_say -PRON- be a very_nice room
-PRON- have a live room and a bed room
there be not a door separate the two room but where be a wall
this particular suite do_not have a fridge which throw -PRON- off because usually suite do
also the small room -PRON- have at the yelp event have a big a mirror where -PRON- can light up where as this suite do_not have one
the wall be kind_of odd as_well because -PRON- be some_sort_of drape on the wall that have a vintage print on -PRON-
-PRON- be not wall paper but just cloth hang on all the wall
the decor be very clique though
the bed be comfy
the bathroom be nice
the lotion smell so good
probably the good one -PRON- have smell in any hotel
the restaurant downstairs be good
-PRON- will review those shortly
overall the hotel be not that big -PRON- can walk from front to end in no time
welcome back bonefish
-PRON- miss -PRON- but -PRON- do_not get 5_star until -PRON- bring grouper back
tito 's texas martini may be the good in_town and such a deal as_well
-PRON- really_enjoy the paco lola albarino
but -PRON- be $_10 less a bottle at king 's fishhouse
-PRON- love the bang bang shrimp and seared ahi appetizer
however the dinner be the real star dorado with mango salsa on the side be incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill
ditto for the redfish special with romesco sauce on the side of_course
overall the food quality may be good_than -PRON- memory of the old store in henderson
a couple of suggestion -PRON- do_not think open bus\/service area will ever be as popular as open_kitchen be so build a wall and add a door
-PRON- be ugly and distract to have that area open to the lovely dining_room
about those window shade -PRON- be go the wrongway
something be need to block the low part of the window to obscure the view of the parking_lot and keep headlight from shin into the dining_room
a_few minor issue that should be address but great food and drink at reasonable_price
hope -PRON- stick around for a long_time
-PRON- go to check_out the brand_new korean grocery in mesa
all the shelf be not fill yet which be understandable be still get everything set_up
-PRON- look_like there will be other restaurant come in the shopping_center as_well
love the option to be able_to shop around for cheap deal with all the new grocery_store opening
can_not wait to see if -PRON- can keep the price low with fresh product
this_place never_disappoint
the pepperoni_pizza have jalapeño pepper good addition to a pizza
-PRON- be a little leery at first
but -PRON- be fantastic
the service and atmosphere be perfect
-PRON- be look for a new vape store since -PRON- mod break

-PRON- do_not have the mod in stock but give -PRON- a evod to use until -PRON- do get -PRON- in
awesome service
also pick_up a bottle_of moshi make in_toronto
roncevalle and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- also like how -PRON- can try -PRON- flavour before make a purchase
-PRON- will_definitely be go_back
-PRON- think -PRON- have say this before but mexican be just not -PRON- favorite food with that say maybe -PRON- should reconsider but only if -PRON- be visit azteca
there absolutely be not one dish -PRON- have not enjoy here and the good part
home make tortilla not mass produce cold pocket of reheat carb -PRON- really could see the smile worker make these by hand near -PRON- table
love fresh guacamole
tackle the member roll the guac cart around and get -PRON- guac specially make for -PRON- here wait

-PRON- get a breakfast burger and be very_pleased_with -PRON-
-PRON- be alone
so -PRON- sit_at the counter in the back get -PRON- own coffee carafe and be happy about -PRON-
just wish there be an egg works in the centennial hills area
this_place be solid
-PRON- be not the good raman -PRON- have have but -PRON- can_not complain at all
-PRON- be a fairly small place borderline cramp
-PRON- come with a friend and -PRON- have to shove -PRON- bag under the table as -PRON- be place up against a wall with just enough room to shimmy between the table to the inside seat
the food come quickly the noodle be cook properly and the broth be decent
-PRON- be not too_expensive either
solid for lunch or a cheap dinner
wow
-PRON- call these_people to ask a simple pricing question and the woman on the other end
say -PRON- do_not carry -PRON- item anymore and hang_up promptly
no suggestion where -PRON- could find -PRON- or how_much -PRON- should cost at a good place
just a dial tone
do_not think lobster be such a sensitive subject and when -PRON- try to call back to talk to a manager since -PRON- hang_up before -PRON- could get another question out without a goodbye the phone be pick_up and hang_up again
so_far -PRON- be shoot for really bad review with -PRON-

what a moron customer_service be not rocket science
-PRON- call back a third_time for the manager and what do -PRON- know

-PRON- would see this crazy mirage in the desert on -PRON- last few vegas trip wonder_what the hell be that and this time after pass -PRON- on the way to vegas -PRON- say -PRON- be stop on the way back to take a close look
well before that happen -PRON- run across a display at the aria that talk_about the seven magic mountains art installation so -PRON- get a little precursor to when -PRON- actually visit
-PRON- will not go into all of the detail of ugo rondinone 's artwork as -PRON- can find out everything about -PRON- at the website
http:\/\/sevenmagicmountains.com\/
but i will tell -PRON- that yup -PRON- just like -PRON- describe some colorfully paint rock stack on_top_of each_other
-PRON- can access seven magic mountains either come from vegas by exit at sloan turn left and then right onto vegas blvd or come from stateline exit at jean turn right then leave on vegas blvd
-PRON- in between those two exit and a parking area be create for easy access
be prepared -PRON- get crowd so get photo without crowd be pretty tough
-PRON- be lucky_enough to have someone out there with all of the professional photography equipment that the website explicitly prohibit so -PRON- have to be super creative to get photo without people or umbrella or wagon etc
but -PRON- do -PRON- because -PRON- be clever like that
overall -PRON- worth see just because -PRON- something unique especially_since -PRON- will only be there for another year
-PRON- be slat to be remove between march and may of 2018
no that be not a mirage
food 3\/\/ ambiance 4 super super average
stop_by for a latte and the famous cardamom bun but be let down by both
could_not even taste the espresso in the coffee but the foam design be cute and the cardamom bun could have be so_much more flavorful

despite -PRON- be location near the route 17 freeway the hotel be surprisingly quiet
the only_complaint be that the driveway can be easily miss the first_time around
if this happen -PRON- have to drive in a giant loop back around because -PRON- be on a one way street
also the equipment in the fitness center be outdat
one of the treadmill be out of order and the other seem to be stick on an incline
other_than these minor complaint -PRON- be pleased_with -PRON- choice to stay_here

lol
-PRON- love the staff here hence the 5_star
come_here last sunday around 10_p.m. for -PRON- happy_hour as part of -PRON- boyfriend 's_birthday after eat at gordon ramsey 's steak
the good parking would be to valet at aria since this_place be right between aria and crystal 's
4_star mainly because -PRON- like the atmosphere -PRON- be the fancy version_of a p.u.b -PRON- have ever see lol
with -PRON- extensive beer menu and 7-second challenge -PRON- could definitely see this as a spot for the guy or any girl that really like beer
-PRON- be mainly a specialty cocktail type person
so -PRON- be not exactly a go to spot for -PRON-
happy_hour 3 6pm 10pm midnight every_day
-1\/2 off pint
-1\/2 wine by the glass -$1 wing -$2 oyster -$3 slider -PRON- love both of -PRON- red and white sangria and -PRON- friend enjoy the wing and oyster
one of -PRON- girlfriend say -PRON- slider be alright
-PRON- still want to come_back here though to possibly try -PRON- p.u.b favorite like -PRON- foot long hot_dog cioppino smore 's board and -PRON- lobster benedict off -PRON- brunch menu
terrible service period since -PRON- do_not speak taiwanese people that show_up after -PRON- get seat before -PRON-
-PRON- get -PRON- food before -PRON- the place be dirty
-PRON- wait at -PRON- table for over 10_minute_before ever be acknowledge -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- would have be long if -PRON- do_not go up to the cashier try to order the table -PRON- have to run and claim -PRON-
the yelp location of the place be completely wrong so a couple of u turn have to happen
wait_forever for the food after wait a lifetime to even put -PRON- order in
while wait watch more people_who arrive after -PRON- get -PRON- food
the food be not worth go_through all the crap
and the check be wrong
really small_portion size but -PRON- be good -fried calamari and okonomiyaki
great location
-PRON- be always super_nice and quik
good deal on food and drink
always a busy place
look for that ice_cream shop that take -PRON- back to the good old day this be the spot to go to
friendly people and plenty_of old_school candy option -PRON- will not be able_to_help -PRON- and indulge just to reminisce
great lunch date for some yummy delicious raman
order the tonkosu raman
have some kind_of pork flavor broth 2 slice of pork and noodle
company come quickly and be helpful and friendly
be back in -PRON- driveway within an_hour call for a tow
great_job
would_highly_recommend
this_place have great frozen_yogurt
the staff be always very_friendly
-PRON- greet customer upon entry and offer sample
there be a very large_selection of topping and plenty_of choice of different flavor of yogurt
-PRON- have a frequent buyer type promotion attach to -PRON- phone_number if -PRON- want to participate
after so_many purchase -PRON- get a three dollar discount
there be also occasional promotional offer on facebook
-PRON- use these offer when -PRON- be available because a visit to this_place can hit -PRON- hard in the pocket book especially if -PRON- have a large family
if -PRON- be not for the kinda expensive price -PRON- would give -PRON- 5_star and -PRON- would bring the family here more_often
other_than_that this be great business overall
absolutely_delicious thai food
get the pad_see_ew drunken_noodle cashew chicken green_curry and egg_roll
nice sized_portion good price and -PRON- delivery quickly
highly_recommend
-PRON- fiance and -PRON- just have dinner here
and -PRON- be hugely disappoint
-PRON- think -PRON- would be great base_on yelp rating
but -PRON- be really quite expensive for mediocre food and exceptionally poor and untrained service
the good great music decent craft_beer selection noda location private parking_lot
the bad
-PRON- believe -PRON- be -PRON- server 's very first day as a server ever
no shadow another server for training however just really bad service
-PRON- be nice but do_not have a clue about be a server
no knowledge of beer or menu in_general
-PRON- do_not stop back by the table after food be serve until -PRON- be finish with -PRON- meal
if -PRON- have -PRON- would have tell -PRON- that the hamburger be overcook as_well do medium well state when order and the dressing be on the salad ask for -PRON- on the side
the french_fry be hot but overcook and a_bit hard
the salad be fine but for $_11 -PRON- would have expect more_than 15 kernel of corn and a single small goat_cheese fritter
the jalapeno ball be tasty but not consistent
some ball contain little jalapeno and lack heat while other have much_more jalapeno and be more flavorful
the restaurant be rather humid which lead to warm drink
when -PRON- ask the server stephanie for a chill glass -PRON- go over to the bartender and then come_back and state that -PRON- do_not keep chill glass what
how can a bar not have chill glass
like -PRON- state earlier there be some problem
-PRON- do go_back to the bartender and relay -PRON- irritation at this and return to the table with an_iced glass which be cold and allow -PRON- to finish -PRON- cider
so while there be potential in this_place live_music on -PRON- would etc
work be definitely need for -PRON- to return
the price for 3 craft_beer a hamburger a salad without protein and a cheap appetizer be $ 52 which seem excessive
for_example -PRON- would have be about the same price at bad daddy 's for appreciably good food service and value
-PRON- finally try this_place out after hear great thing
-PRON- love almost everything over all good restaurant
-PRON- love the atmosphere style decor of the place
service be attentive and -PRON- app and side_dish be excellent
and the server surprise -PRON- with a complimentary dessert at the end which -PRON- love
-PRON- do_not love -PRON- steak just be not great which be always a bummer at a nice steak_house
and the upselling be a little aggressive from the server but i get -PRON- just try to do -PRON- job
-PRON- be a server too
so i notice when -PRON- be be up sell a lot
over all good experience
and -PRON- enjoy the night
come_here to meet friend
-PRON- have never be before
the waitress be extremely_friendly and seem to absolutely_love -PRON- job
-PRON- have the pancake serve all day
-PRON- be okay
-PRON- have have good but -PRON- have also have bad
-PRON- come on a huge plate though which be awesome
and the butter be amazing
-PRON- be some type_of cinnamon honey butter
mmmmm
after -PRON- be do -PRON- bring -PRON- all gummy bear shot on the house
then -PRON- come_out with -PRON- 3 ft cotton_candy tower
-PRON- say -PRON- be train one of the girl on the machine and think -PRON- may enjoy -PRON-
such superb service

great customer_service
highly knowledgeable
and -PRON- do_not feel pressured like -PRON- do in more supplement place
-PRON- let -PRON- sample before -PRON- pick_up anything -PRON- be great
100 recommend_this_place to anybody look to get real result from real people
great company to work with
everyone be courteous and helpful from the time -PRON- call to the completion of the job
-PRON- explain the process call the insurance_company for approval and do a great_job with the glass replacement at -PRON- house
-PRON- would use -PRON- again in a heartbeat
-PRON- be good
good_than u swirl and as good if not a_bit good_than golden spoon
-PRON- be really clean which -PRON- be picky about b\/c well self_serve
make -PRON- cringe a_bit to be honest but all the topping look fresh and -PRON- be super neat not all mixed together by people with unsteady spoon
-PRON- son and -PRON- go and while -PRON- be still a munchkin for both -PRON- chocolate yogurt with mini pb cup combination and -PRON- vanilla with m 's as -PRON- call m and m 's -PRON- be $ 3.37 and -PRON- feel_like -PRON- have a very full cup
pretty busy on a tuesday_night but not overally slam
yogurt be creamy
-PRON- will be back
there spoon be really awesome too not all flimsy like really_cool green spoon
yes
im weird deal
-PRON- be not from_hawaii but have a huge api community back in the bay california -PRON- would have ginormous event such_as these sound of hawaii in mountain view and tahiti fete in san jose be two that come to mind make -PRON- miss home
but one of las_vegas big knock be the lack of cultural diversity -PRON- have here so when event such_as these arise -PRON- imperative for -PRON- local to come_out to celebrate and support -PRON- halaus various vendor and community group that put in the time and effort to put these dope event together
accord to nelson q. this year 's festival be fairly large than last_year 's

crepe -PRON- order be polo ham blue_cheese fresh spinach and fly baby- tomato mozzarella and blue_cheese
-PRON- can add any ingredient for $_1
the crepes be thin and light and flavourful
-PRON- do_not get a chance to try -PRON- sweet crepes
the owner maggie introduce -PRON- homemade jam and -PRON- mention -PRON- produce be locally grow at gilcrease orchard
-PRON- have try cupcake here and there around edinburgh and have never once taste something that come remotely close to the heaven that this little bakery put out
not only be the cake of superb quality but the frosting be as_well
this_place be a must visit if -PRON- be a true cake fan
even -PRON- partner who have little interest in cake or anything sweet be a convert
the shop boast of a daily selection of 12 cupcake and -PRON- seem to deliver
apple toffee be one of -PRON- specialty and be spectacular the carrot_cake be spot on and the black bottom cupcake be deliciously rich
upon carry -PRON- little cupcake box home -PRON- be stop_by a woman on the street who remark that this be -PRON- new_favorite place and that -PRON- can refill the box for -PRON- on the next_visit to cut back on waste
cuckoo 's bakery be right_next to -PRON- flat which be a mixed blessing
-PRON- be try to limit -PRON- visit to special_occasion only real or create
horrible experience
the food be bad order the sea_bass dish as entree the fish be stale and cook even bad
end_up leave the place just after the starter course which be also forgettable note unique authentic or safe at this_place
never again bad food bad service an disgrace to beautiful old montreal restaurant scene
-PRON- be always on the search for great style\/cut\/color at a fair_price
-PRON- have just enjoy -PRON- second_visit to toni guy 's at arrowhead mall
first kelly have do a fantastic job with the hair color follow_by a great precision cut by allison
-PRON- would_highly_recommend -PRON- service
hand_down good chicken_wing in_town great service
-PRON- eat_here all the time and have never have a bad meal
and -PRON- can_not beat the price
only bad spot be the man 's washroom need to be fix up -PRON- pretty bad
kitchen close at 9:50 on a saturday $_5 beer in a plastic cup and no lock on the bathroom stall
not impressed at all and can get a cheap beer with at_least a late_night menu elsewhere
-PRON- be crazy that -PRON- be do this with friend
-PRON- look fun but make_sure do_not do -PRON- right after -PRON- eat
lol
pizza be not very memorable
do_not get the truffled mushroom pizza
can_not taste even a hint_of truffle and the balsamic only make the pizza smell sour without provide any flavor
the olive and pub board be pretty_good
do_not try any wine
service be ok
the hostess do_not_know_how to wipe_down the table -PRON- wipe the table around the plate and menu that -PRON- just put down so when -PRON- pick_up -PRON- menu and move -PRON- plate
the table be dirty again
so -PRON- have live_in_phoenix for 35 year now and drive all over the place to hike
now -PRON- live in cave creek so -PRON- decide to check_out spur cross that -PRON- can access just before -PRON- get to downtown cave creek
so how good can -PRON- be so close to town
-PRON- go this past sunday and start_off on an intermediate trail which be just be -PRON- say but then -PRON- be pleasantly_surprised that the creek be actually run
-PRON- have board over the first few crossing
and then -PRON- have to do a_little_bit of boulder hop on the later crossing
-PRON- go in about two mile until -PRON- get to the horse back rid stable -PRON- think -PRON- be just a stop for -PRON- tour
great scenery even if the creek be not run and even better that -PRON- be
so on the way back -PRON- decide to do the easy leg to the parking_lot and wow
there be some of the largest saguaro 's -PRON- have ever see in az
if -PRON- have out of town guest and want to impress -PRON- take -PRON- here
-PRON- only 1.5 mile on dirt road and the easy trail where the impressive cactus be be only about mile so even out of shape guest can do -PRON-
then head into cave creek for some food
-PRON- will not be sorry -PRON- take the time to drive up there
-PRON- be a donut lover and live by -PRON- glaze donut
if a bakery can_not execute the most simple glaze donut well shame on -PRON-
and -PRON- would like to say shame on -PRON- raised glazed
-PRON- think a glaze donut from dunkin donuts would have taste fresh and good
-PRON- buy a dozen donut this morning to give to -PRON- friend_who be celebrate -PRON- birthday today
-PRON- taste the donut and be a little disappointed by the texture
the donut be fairly cold as if -PRON- be refrigerate the underside be crispy\/crunchy as -PRON- if be over cook and -PRON- completely lack the pillowy texture
-PRON- opinion be if -PRON- can_not make a glaze donut
well there be no reason for -PRON- to go_back
-PRON- will not be go_back to this_place
for -PRON- first_time here with an ethnic dining lunch meetup -PRON- find -PRON- 3 taco lunch_special 1 fry shrimp_taco 1 fry catfish taco 1 shred beef taco all top with diced tomato and cabbage boring and unremarkable not the 4.5_star -PRON- read
the bottom of all 3 taco fall out before -PRON- pick -PRON- up so have to ask for additional tortilla even bean and rice boring
server say the bottom fall out because -PRON- put salsa in the taco -PRON- do that because -PRON- find the flavor boring
-PRON- think -PRON- fellow diner like -PRON- selection better_than -PRON- like -PRON-
guy_who order the drunken shrimp like a cerviche
the shrimp be raw really love -PRON- order tho -PRON- think the portion be very small for $ 16.95
-PRON- guess -PRON- be compare that price with ayce shrimp cook 5 different way at an asian buffet that -PRON- can eat for lunch for $_8
except for the lunch_special item -PRON- think the food here be kinda expensive for the building and area and in some case the portion_size like the actual size of the fish fillet on the veracruz order
-PRON- may come_back to try_something_else but really -PRON- think la santisma 's food just a_few door south on same street and side be much good in taste portion_size not talk_about bean and rice and la santisma be also 4.5 yelp star
-PRON- rate ls 's food 5_star highly_recommend the marlin quesadilla a large empanada seal and fry
that -PRON- make 3 dinner out of
-PRON- could make a dinner just out of -PRON- 16 kind_of salsa in the salsa_bar alone
3_star for mariscos ensenada for the food
la santisma be on check
please recently too
-PRON- would be interested_in people 's comparison of ls 's food to me 's since both be 4.5_star
-PRON- rate the service -PRON- have 11 people at -PRON- table today when restaurant be not busy or pack 1:30 pm 4_star
mean to post this review month_ago but get distract
great little_gem of a shop with the most helpful service -PRON- would not take -PRON- shoe to repair because -PRON- say any repair make would not last
and -PRON- do_not want to cost -PRON- the money
more_importantly -PRON- have some leather purse that be in need of what -PRON- think be a cleaning -PRON- explain to -PRON- that -PRON- be actually the leather dye wear off after year of use
although -PRON- do_not in store dye because of concern about -PRON- ability to color match these item -PRON- be walk_through the process and dye purchasing
edit to add dyed the purse -PRON- -PRON- turn_out great
-PRON- food be very authentic and tasty
-PRON- enjoy a number_of various entree and appetizer
-PRON- like the drunken_noodle and the spring_roll
-PRON- will return
every_time -PRON- have be here -PRON- have have terrific meal
if -PRON- have the lobster benedict on the menu -PRON- be a must order
the pancake be some of the good -PRON- have have
-PRON- normally go there for breakfast and 8:30 seem to be the time where -PRON- get really busy
very_popular place -PRON- show_up 30_min after open for lunch and end_up wait for an_hour
the place be small so -PRON- fill_up quickly
-PRON- be surprised when -PRON- ask for tea that -PRON- come from a heated can
would definitely go again when -PRON- be in_town
place be a little small so -PRON- can get pack very quickly
-PRON- have be here two time
-PRON- favourite would be the tuna taco for sure
the tuna be lightly sear on the outside and -PRON- get a good amount_of tuna per taco as_well along_with crisp veggie crunchy noodle and peanut top with a wasabi mayo which -PRON- always ask for extra of
both time -PRON- order the tuna taco and -PRON- be consistent on both occasion
there be three generous taco which -PRON- do_not realize the first_time
so -PRON- share -PRON- the second_time
-PRON- also have the oyster both time
thursday be oyster night $_1 although -PRON- be a little small in size that when -PRON- order the regular price one
oyster do_not come with the sauce or fresh horseradish as -PRON- normally prefer only come with pre_make horseradish cocktail sauce and lemon
clam_chowder and lobster grill_cheese be both good
lobster_bisque be ok but -PRON- prefer the clam_chowder personally
as everyone have mention -PRON- do_not serve alcohol and the table be more like patio table than true dining table but other_than_that -PRON- highly_recommend the restaurant
-PRON- do_not live too_far away
so -PRON- will_definitely become regular
-PRON- have some time alone yesterday
so -PRON- venture out to use -PRON- groupon
-PRON- be aware of this_place but never stop in
-PRON- must_say that the quality and overall taste of the tea in this store be by_far the fine in the valley
-PRON- be a tea lover so this store be quite a find for -PRON-
in_addition -PRON- sell a number_of tea related gadgetry and trinket
the tea selection be mainly sell in 100 g pack between $_5.00 and $ 7.00
-PRON- only suggestion would be to increase seating and sell some mancha and other less common pure tea
a helpful and well learn staff
give -PRON- a try
super_fast and friendly
-PRON- bring -PRON- daughter 's 5c to get the screen fix
-PRON- tell -PRON- 30_min and -PRON- be ready in less_than that
really friendly
-PRON- would_recommend this_place
only come_here for lunch or breakfast
-PRON- make the mistake of go for dinner and -PRON- be horrible
-PRON- remember order some fish dish
and -PRON- come with a grassland on_top_of -PRON-
-PRON- feel_like i be eat the fish straight up on the floor of a savannah
however i do come for lunch and have the chicken and waffle
-PRON- dunno if snoop dogs ever be here
but -PRON- be sure -PRON- would agree that the chicken n waffle be bomb digity
the portion be a_bit ridiculous but -PRON- go with -PRON- theme
-PRON- eat half the meal and -PRON- still look_like -PRON- be untouched
service be good and quick all the staff be very_friendly
-PRON- would definitely_come_back and recommend anyone to try -PRON- if -PRON- have not

not the easy to navigate into and out of
but -PRON- be well_worth the hassle and potential car wreck
atmosphere ambiance
3\/5 bbq king be an_old school drive in joint where the car hop come to -PRON- car with -PRON- grub after -PRON- place -PRON- order in a charlie 's angels speaker box
think of sonic but ya_know like back in the 60 's and stuff

cleanliness
4\/5 see above
the facility be date but -PRON- food have also be on point in_term_of hair to food ratio
service
4\/5
the car hop be cordial and friendly
the staff inside be likely as_well
food 5\/5
dear little baby jesus that bbq fried_chicken be amazing
-PRON- stay crispy even while slather in tangy bbq_sauce
-PRON- can_not string the word together that will do justice to this culinary masterpiece
-PRON- love bbq and -PRON- love fried_chicken
and -PRON- have become some what of an aficionado
so
yeah
-PRON- know -PRON- stuff
-PRON- will not be disappoint
the hush puppy be legit too
top_notch experience once -PRON- get into the building
-PRON- be about 8_p.m. when when -PRON- finally get inside and due_to -PRON- be so hot and employee pass out water and popsicle
-PRON- get some edible which be amazing but -PRON- should have follow direction because -PRON- experience be a little outrageous
once -PRON- fill out the paperwork and head inside -PRON- be immediately place in another line to get inside the area where -PRON- buy
-PRON- will not sell -PRON- more_than 98 mg of edible and -PRON- get a small container of sugary gummi bear
-PRON- be legit
-PRON- have be back twice in the last 4 month
definitely_recommend but come after 1 p.m.
if -PRON- want fantastic chinese_food that be at an affordable price this be the place to go
-PRON- go with a friend and stuff -PRON- face all for $_25 with include
the serving be pretty big and the service be more friendly that china town and just as fast if not more quick
to compare -PRON- to china town the food have more flavour and less greasy
the atmosphere be more clean and the price be about the same and depend_on the item possibly cheap
-PRON- would_recommend if -PRON- be in the north york area and crave some good chinese dining definitely check this_place out
poor_customer_service and crappy food at its other location divinos
-PRON- will say the food be ok at_this_location -PRON- other location be so gosh darn awful
-PRON- would_rather have a a bologna sandwich from tent city
this_location slather -PRON- sandwich with mayo when the menu specifically list all -PRON- be ingredient and yet do_not specify that -PRON- come with mayo
when -PRON- send a complaint by email there be no reply
this be inexcusable
and do_not ever eat at -PRON- other location on greenway
nasty
-PRON- really_enjoy the side_dish -PRON- give -PRON- to munch on as -PRON- wait for the food which consist_of pickle radish pickle onion and popcorn
for some_reason -PRON- find the taste of the radish to blend really well with the taste of popcorn
okay
this may just -PRON- -PRON- though do_not blame -PRON- if -PRON- get sick
as for the chicken -PRON- order cheese and spicy half and half
-PRON- really like the cheese one
taste_like the one -PRON- have in korea
as for the spicy one -PRON- do_not taste the spice at all wish -PRON- make -PRON- more hot
the only_thing -PRON- will mention be that -PRON- find the chicken to be a bit_dry and some of the piece be a_bit tasteless
just a_bit
so -PRON- do_not really matter that much to -PRON-
-PRON- also do_not find the price to be that bad either

waren hi mit circa
100 personen beim kriminal dinner
-PRON- be großen saal
personal war heillo überlastet
unfreundliche chefin sorgte mit ihrem überzogenen komandogehabe für viel unruhe
getränkebestellungen wurden oft vergessen sehr überschaubare menü portionen chaotisch servieren vom nachschlag das_essen selbst war sehr gut aber viel zu wenig schöne ambiente
drive up -PRON- will wonder_if -PRON- need a bulletproof vest

this_place have awesome food
for whatev reason the chip be to die for
-PRON- have eat there twice and thoroughly_enjoy -PRON- meal however -PRON- stomach do_not
the first_time -PRON- eat there -PRON- feel a little ill but figure -PRON- be -PRON- sensitive stomach
the last_time -PRON- eat there
-PRON- be vomit the rest_of the night and into the next_day
even_though the food be so yummy -PRON- can_not bear to go_back there
cleanliness be definitely an_issue
if -PRON- be willing_to risk a vomit party later that night then go for -PRON-
the food really be good why else would i give a place that make -PRON- vomit 2_star
-PRON- be look for a good bar to hang_out at before a concert at stage ae
-PRON- want to sit_down for several drink before head out
one bartender take -PRON- beer order
after a few_minute wait another bartender ask if -PRON- have be help and -PRON- say yes ask -PRON- what -PRON- order be and pour -PRON- for -PRON-
the other bartender begin argue_with -PRON- and the other bartender as to who be serve -PRON-
-PRON- be clearly irritated with -PRON- and each_other
-PRON- quickly get -PRON- drink and head outside where a manager immediately stop -PRON- and say -PRON- could_not sit out here unless -PRON- be be seat to eat
although -PRON- could understand such a policy if -PRON- be very busy but there be ton_of open seating and -PRON- be extremely_rude
all of this happen in about 5_minute
-PRON- suck down -PRON- beer and jet
-PRON- love pittsburgh but this will_never be on -PRON- list again
the other bar around here be much_more fun accommodate and fantastic
be really excited to visit this_place as -PRON- fall in love with the german beer hall -PRON- visit in munich long communal wooden table ma sized beer and plenty_of sausage
visit for the first_time during euro 2012 to cheer for deutschland of_course
when you first arrive -PRON- order at the front counter then give a numbered sign to sit_at -PRON- table
the staff will bring -PRON- food to -PRON-
and to clarify to the few complain_about the service if -PRON- want to re order go up to the front to re order food yourself or go to the side bar to pick_up beer or wine
the wait staff be obviously willing_to_help -PRON- out but -PRON- be mostly there to bring food and clear away dish
the staff be friendly and work hard so kindly remember to leave a tip at the front register
food
-PRON- order the traditional bratwvrst while -PRON- boyfriend have wild_boar
the bun be fresh and perfectly toast but -PRON- find the sausage to be a bit_dry even with caramelize onion heap on_top add some table mustard help
-PRON- will perhaps try the saucy currywurst version the next_time
also have the plain fry which be hand cut plentiful and delicious even more so with the choice of 2 dipping_sauce
-PRON- have hear amazing thing_about the duck fat fry which some say be heavy tasting but nothing like -PRON- have have before
facility
-PRON- be not a huge beer drinker but -PRON- boyfriend be impressed that the bar have a post schedule as to when the beer tap be last clean which be more_often than_most place
plenty_of wooden table around include a_few cozy spot in the back and a_few in a newly open patio
-PRON- have a giant projection screen that pull down at the front block the kitchen view the placement be a_bit awkward and -PRON- have a_bit of trouble see over people 's head to watch the euro but -PRON- do realize that this be not a sport_bar thankfully
so -PRON- should not complain
the bathroom be clean modern and tidy and be surprised\/amus to see the stall build similarly to the one in munich concrete enclose wall with thick door
so soundproof that -PRON- could drop a proverbial bomb in there and no one would be the wise
this be -PRON- go to place for delivery in 30_min or less
pizza be great the wing be top_notch an no one beat -PRON- salad
if -PRON- like spicy -PRON- highly_recommend the philly sandwich with jalapeños and a side of aus jus

la décoration de l'endroit rappel le bar françai l'barouf de_la rue st denis à montréal

le menu bouffe avec des plat d'influence marocaine et européenne
est inventif et différent de ce qu'on trouve généralement dan les bar de quartier
en autre on peut manger différente sorte de coucous de salade de pizza sur pain plat et de sous marin do_not une excellente mitraillette sous marin à_la merguez

what_happen in_vegas well -PRON- know the rest
anyway this_place be old
but -PRON- be kind_of charming to see something old_school amidst the shine and glitter
-PRON- remind -PRON- of when -PRON- use to go to vegas as a child
w\/ -PRON- parent and grandparent
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- would stay_here and actually sleep in a bed only because -PRON- do_not_know_how clean -PRON- be
-PRON- be just so old so as_far as upkeep go -PRON- be pretty
well -PRON- would compare the room to a motel -PRON- find on the side of the freeway
no actual restaurant in the place at_least -PRON- do_not think
and the tattoo shop say -PRON- be open twenty four hour
but when -PRON- go in at 3:30 in the morning to get -PRON- tattoo do -PRON- be close

there be not a lot_of meat but -PRON- be enough to keep the meaty flavour throughout
veggie and spice be also do in good balance complement the mac and cheese not overpower -PRON-
the only down side be a lack of place to eat there be a couple of stand up table for the whole arcade
-PRON- first experience here be poor as the wait be very long
in all fairness -PRON- have only just open and -PRON- be exceptionally busy and -PRON- do_not have the staff to handle the demand

highly_recommend
great place very_knowledgeable and friendly
-PRON- find -PRON- always slow when -PRON- walk past this_place as -PRON- use to be so intrigue by -PRON-
what look_like an apparently nameless restaurant on george iv bridge with a lovely chalk lunch menu outside and what look_like a lovely air y space inside
-PRON- end_up finally get to go to the outsider as a wee treat before leave edinburgh and -PRON- get to say -PRON- be the perfect choice
this_place be elegant but lay_back the food have a good modern twist
but -PRON- present a little slap dash and slightly rustic which -PRON- quite like
the service be friendly and -PRON- find -PRON- wish -PRON- have come_here more before leave
-PRON- pigeon with serrano ham with a mix of bean and beetroot salsa be heavenly
-PRON- only wish -PRON- have be a little more hungry and have some starter and dessert
from what -PRON- can gather the menu seem to change very frequently which -PRON- think be fab
-PRON- would definitely go again for dinner and -PRON- have hear that the lunch offer be ace
-PRON- have be go_back to vince regularly each week for the past month
and -PRON- have decide to upgrade -PRON- by one_star because the service have improve since -PRON- last review the restaurant
-PRON- find that go early in the morning when the restaurant open be the good time to go
-PRON- be not so busy at that hour and service tend_to be more attentive
if -PRON- go often enough and the waiter recognize -PRON- -PRON- will obviously treat -PRON- better
-PRON- still think the dim_sum here be good
-PRON- recommend the shrimp dumpl in papaya soup and -PRON- rice_noodle roll
sometimes the latter be hit or miss but generally -PRON- find that vince make one of the good rice_noodle roll in_town
the skin be thin and wrap tightly around the content which be how rice_noodle roll be suppose to be make
so what make -PRON- come_back to vince in the first place
-PRON- be look for a restaurant that be nice and quiet on a weekend morning and this_place do_not really get busy until 10:00 am and what bring -PRON- back a second and third_time be that the service gradually improve with each visit
most of all -PRON- can yum cha for hour and -PRON- will not rush -PRON-
finally have -PRON- first cronut
omg yum
thank -PRON- america for these lovely pastry
-PRON- try the original and the lemon and -PRON- be both delicious
and -PRON- better be for $_3.50 a cronut
-PRON- will most def be come_back for more
such an_awesome show
-PRON- love all music and be the only_reason why -PRON- opt to watch this show with family
-PRON- be bear in the 80_'s and be not_sure how_much -PRON- would like -PRON-
before the show -PRON- only know very little about music in the 60 's to 80_'s the typical journey koss etc song
after the show -PRON- leave that theater with a great appreciation of classic rock and learn a lot_of -PRON- history
-PRON- be literally blow_away_by the musician and the sound_system
some musician be former memeber of some of most classic band
-PRON- get -PRON- signature after the show too
-PRON- have so_many amazing instrument
-PRON- really_enjoy the slide show and read the history and tibit on the different song
if -PRON- be not for a couple of 10_year old boy watch the show with -PRON- parent -PRON- husband and -PRON- woukd have be the young attendee lol
definitely_recommend
-PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- have be in line for an_hour and a half wait to be seat at the buffet
there be approximately 20 open table that have be close for the evening despite the buffet line go around the corner
this food better be damn good
-PRON- wish -PRON- can give 0_star to this_location
the manager here be extremely_rude and condescending
if -PRON- tell -PRON- the equipment be break -PRON- will deny -PRON- and say no -PRON- be not go check again which most of the time there be at_least two three machine break plus the accessory on the work machine be break
-PRON- do_not listen to complaint and offer absolutely no help to guest here at all
-PRON- boast about how -PRON- be be a manager for year and year here but never work out here to know_what be wrong with the gym equipment
this_place be good at serve drink
this be the first_time -PRON- have eat at this pub for a group lunch and decide to order a simple dish chicken_finger and yam fry
how could anyone mess_up that order
well first -PRON- take_forever with the food order
and then -PRON- serve -PRON- with sour_cream not plum sauce
sweet_potato_fry be soggy and salty but chicken_finger be what -PRON- expect
overall this pub lack speed and quality unless -PRON- be only consume beer with a large_group
do -PRON- a favour and check_out the small king george pub in the next plaza next to the wendys
come_here on a friday_night
have the calmar half chicken and gyro pita and the house white_wine all be amazing
maybe a_bit too_much sauce in the pita but no biggie
cost 65 $ in total
and -PRON- be beyond satisfied
friendly service too highly_recommend for a cheap night out
this be -PRON- favorite benihana location -PRON- have be to simply for the decor
-PRON- be all dress in kimono and the place have fountain and fish in a pond -PRON- truely beautiful
-PRON- love come_here with -PRON- girlfriend for a date_night or to celebrate a birthday
-PRON- wish all benihana location be like this
the price be a_bit high_than other benihana restaurant but the service -PRON- would far better
-PRON- be in the westgate hotel so there be lot_of parking available
do_not go there
give a rating of one_star be way_too_much for the horrible service -PRON- get there
-PRON- sign_up few_month_ago and the trainer -PRON- be supposed"to meet_up with be never available and the one time -PRON- run into -PRON- at the gym -PRON- be too_busy text away not even engage with the conversation
the owner jay by_far the bad owner
-PRON- lack of customer_service and knowledge of how to run -PRON- business be pathetic
-PRON- be charge multiple_time for the membership after -PRON- have give -PRON- 30day notice to cancel and when -PRON- reach out to the owner for resolution on reimburse -PRON- money
-PRON- say -PRON- would call -PRON- back within an_hour
4 hour go by no call from the owner when -PRON- call -PRON- back -PRON- be so rude unprofessional and incompetent to resolve the matter
-PRON- try to rush -PRON- off the phone and say -PRON- would call -PRON- back
yeah right
once -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be go to report -PRON- to the bbb -PRON- then say -PRON- will look into -PRON- and email -PRON- receipt
still nothing
bbb get a nice report from -PRON- and couple other client that use to go with -PRON- and be just as dissatisfied with -PRON- lame service
bottom_line this_place be not worth -PRON- in a lot_of different aspect
the owner clearly have_no_idea how to keep client or even hire professional trainer
do_not go there unless u wanna be ignore and mess with -PRON- bank account
-PRON- come to the henry for the first_time last_weekend on -PRON- birthday

-PRON- friend and -PRON- share the caramel apple french_toast and the avocado toast
both be absolutely_amazing
-PRON- also get a free dessert for -PRON- birthday a peanut_butter molten cake that be bring_out with a candle
-PRON- will_definitely be back again for brunch
this be an unexpected surprise come from -PRON- eleven year_old daughter request to eat_here

fried rice be -PRON- favorite and be just so fluffy and flavorful -PRON- could_not put -PRON- fork down
the menu offer a wide_variety of entree special and japanese roll to please any age palate
oh by the way if -PRON- have never try larb list on the menu under salads
-PRON- highly_recommend -PRON- do
-PRON- have be eat this salad as_an_appetizer most_likely will serve four diner for the past twenty year throughout the united states

na rai be head to head with another thai_restaurant -PRON- love and a thumb_up on -PRON- palate
front_desk be very polite professional helpful
cody therapist be great
-PRON- really focus_on -PRON- area of concern
-PRON- be also very relaxing enjoyable
-PRON- would definitely use -PRON- again
frankly the only_reason anyone stop here be because -PRON- have a monopoly on fast_food in_town
if -PRON- put any_other fast_food chain up against mcdonald_'s in mon city perhaps thing would be good
-PRON- be slow frequently mess_up order and often rude
truly terrible
-PRON- do_not_know_why -PRON- have be allow to monopolize this town 's business but -PRON- be go on for far too_long
-PRON- buy a_few car for family_member and -PRON- over the last few decade
a recent car purchase at stouffville hyundai be the smooth most efficient and least stressful
the big contributing factor be the sale team that handle the transaction
first and foremost salesperson barbara wood arrange 2 car for -PRON- to test_drive
-PRON- highlight the feature and difference_between the 2 model during the test_drive
-PRON- step into the showroom expect to receive a promotional retail rebate per newspaper ad and an apa rebate between hyundai canada the manufacturer and a professional association that -PRON- belong to
-PRON- agree to honour both rebate
during the negotiation process barb help -PRON- to negotiate a fair deal that be profitable to the dealership and would fit -PRON- budget -PRON- change to a low model to accommodate -PRON- budget constraint
barb wood be so knowledgeable friendly helpful down to earth and full of positive energy -PRON- would buy -PRON- next car from -PRON- in a heartbeat
-PRON- attitude go in be -PRON- just want a fair transaction not to make a dealership lose money or allow -PRON- to be rip_off
luckily the sale team -PRON- deal with be agreeable to -PRON- attitude and that be so refresh
aside_from barb the team include darren doner the general_manager and jim spicer the new cars sales manager
darren be the cool general_manager
-PRON- be instrumental in agree to the 2 rebate that -PRON- mention above
jim assist in locate the model and colour -PRON- want
-PRON- research the whole canada for -PRON-
the sale team at stouffville hyundai be a great team to deal with
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- to anyone_who be interested_in buy a hyundai
when -PRON- want mexican -PRON- go here
hand_down the good spot in cleveland
as a regular -PRON- tend_to get the lettuce cup taco or a bowl as a healthy option but when -PRON- to indulge -PRON- get the chimichanga
-PRON- be basically a fry burrito and -PRON- be phenomenal
-PRON- love the chicken tinga
if -PRON- get taco -PRON- can get different_type_of meat
and -PRON- could spend the rest_of -PRON- life eat -PRON- house salsa
for the vegetarian out there -PRON- will not go hungry there be lot_of delicious option
-PRON- must have come on a off day because the dim_sum be mediocre and the service be exceptionally bad at rol san
-PRON- wait to be seat for 30_minute even_though there be no line when -PRON- arrive
the attendant ignore -PRON- in favour of wave in chinese speaker which be especially frustrating
the food -PRON- be greasy and sub_par compare to -PRON- previous dim_sum experience
-PRON- order deep_fry squid tentacle which be drip in oil and chewy indicate -PRON- be probably frozen
the traditional dumpling har gow etc be decent but wrap in a very thick dumpl wrapper that be less palatable than the wrapper at comparable restaurant
consider the price -PRON- be not awful but -PRON- be certainly greasy unsophisticated and mediocre
love_this_place
love the atmosphere
staff very_friendly and nice
have the tonkontsu raman with mushroom and bok_choy
very_flavorful
mushroom seem_like there be sautéed almost for a steak
would go again minus mushroom
maybe replace with marinate shiitake
yum will go again though
be in the area wait to meet_up with friend for dinner so decide to drop by to get some ice_cream
the place be small but feel very cosy and welcome
for the ice_cream there be two flavour purple sweet_potato and green_tea
-PRON- only pick single flavour $_3.50 because -PRON- want to taste the purple sweet_potato by -PRON- but -PRON- have an option to get the twist swirl
-PRON- be -PRON- first_time eat ice_cream with rice krispies
and -PRON- really like -PRON-
-PRON- be super crunchy and add a toasted flavour to the ice_cream
however -PRON- could_not really taste the purple sweet_potato and -PRON- be more to the milky side
-PRON- be still good ice_cream just not what -PRON- expect do_not forget to grab a bag of house make taro chip
when -PRON- get there a new batch be be make and -PRON- be still warm
-PRON- really_enjoy these chip
would love to go_back and try -PRON- chicken katsu burger and grab some more taro chip
great restaurant in the linq outside strip with price that be reasonable
-PRON- stop_by after a work trade show on a tuesday
the atmosphere be nice
-PRON- be situate by the linq high roller wheel
nice outdoor space with a view
the place be pack and there be a wait of about 30_min but -PRON- be able_to marry up 4 chair at the bar
if -PRON- love beer and beer_on_tap as_well_as bottle this be -PRON- spot
everything from wheat beer to pilsner to sour
the have -PRON- all and be knowledgeable enough to walk -PRON- through what -PRON- be look for or give -PRON- a taste
highly_recommend
as_far food
-PRON- order the ahi_tuna with jasmine rice and asparagus
in a city that be so pricy and fill with food option -PRON- be nice to get s great meal at a price -PRON- use to
the tuna be cook_perfectly and the whole dish work
all in all after a_few beer and dinner -PRON- be set
if -PRON- be ever back in this part of vegas -PRON- would come_back
keep -PRON- up yard house
cheer justin
omg why do -PRON- take over 2_hour for dinner
the course be small enough that -PRON- be finish in minute and then the wait time between each be up to 30_minute
2 out of 4 get -PRON- coffee after the main be finish but the other 2 only get -PRON- after -PRON- have finish dessert and sit wait
this be ridiculous for a restaurant not at full capacity
the waiter change during the meal and -PRON- seem rush and confused
the qpr here be seriously lack and let be real the food be often over salt and mediocre
seriously
canned chickpea in a salad and 1.5 cherry tomato
-PRON- be so underwhelmed -PRON- would have leave if -PRON- be not a meal with -PRON- boyfriend 's family
here be a little info for business owner everywhere a poorly keep bathroom be totally gross
no one want to go_somewhere where -PRON- will end_up pay at_least $_40 pp and then use a restroom miss door handle part toilet paper and paper towel on the floor and seat that be almost hang off
done over never again
rails and ales be -PRON- go to place
-PRON- love -PRON- there
the good part be definitely -PRON- service the waitress chef be the epitome of good customer_service
when -PRON- get busy -PRON- be a little_slow on the service but_hey -PRON- only have one server two on a big sport night
so -PRON- can_not expect -PRON- to be that rapid
-PRON- be friendly -PRON- take_care_of -PRON- and -PRON- make the effort to remember -PRON-
-PRON- love that
the pricing be fabulous
as a broke university student cheap food and alcohol be always great
some of -PRON- food be about average but if -PRON- be look for recommendation poutine -PRON- be talk like 5.50 for a plate as big as -PRON- head
love -PRON-
home burger this be also about 5.50 or 6 $ and the bun do_not hold up too well but that be because the patty be thick and juicy
great find
garlic\/cheese bread and the greek fry be also other appetizer -PRON- turn to when -PRON- be low on cash but -PRON- be sure as hell fill
10\/10 would_recommend
amazing customer_service
the internet be down and the waiter let -PRON- link to the datum on -PRON- phone because the international datum on -PRON- plan be not function
-PRON- ask if -PRON- have a pinot open -PRON- would love a glass even_though -PRON- be not on the menu by the glass
-PRON-
bring -PRON- to -PRON- by the glass open the bottle just for -PRON-
the food be delightful fresh and full of delicate spice
a definite gem
horrible service
-PRON- sit_at -PRON- table for 15_minute after the host seat -PRON- and not one person come to take -PRON- order
at_least 4 different server walk by -PRON- and nobody say anything
the restaurant have maybe 6 table -PRON- be 8:30_pm on_monday 24 april
after the remodel -PRON- would think the staff would be on -PRON- a game to win back the customer that go_somewhere_else to eat during the week that -PRON- be close
-PRON- will not be back -PRON- lose a loyal_customer
sad
first_time here be great -PRON- be just 2 of -PRON-
go_back with more people and the service be very slow and automatic charge for tip because a large_group which be fine if the service be good but -PRON- have to flag someone down to help -PRON-
originally -PRON- want to eat some thai style noodle house
to -PRON- dismay -PRON- be close in 10_minute when -PRON- arrive
so off -PRON- treck to the next asian restaurant and land in pho kim long
one thing_about this_place be that -PRON- be open_24_hour a day
and -PRON- be inform that -PRON- be the only pho place that have these hour
please correct -PRON- if -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- be -PRON- bf and two of -PRON- friend_who share this experience with -PRON-
-PRON- never really know_what to order from here
so -PRON- have -PRON- friend order for -PRON-
when the bowl come -PRON- way -PRON- be very excited as -PRON- would never have -PRON- before
-PRON- believe -PRON- be pho with some kind_of beef ball
there be other meat in there
but -PRON- forget to ask what type -PRON- be
the broth be good without the extra sauce that people normally put in there
when add the bean_sprout mint and jalapeno 's the kick -PRON- give be a whirlwind of pleasure in -PRON- tongue
-PRON- boyfriend order the fry_rice
the color be somewhat orangey yellow
-PRON- have never have anything like -PRON-
per -PRON- friend the way -PRON- be make be the cook add just the yolk to give -PRON- that sunshine color
-PRON- be definitely different
but -PRON- can_not say -PRON- would order -PRON- for -PRON- in the future
the other dish -PRON- have be a spicy tofu
that be really addict
normally tofu do_not blend well with anything because of how bland -PRON- be
but -PRON- add the right_amount_of spice to give -PRON- a pleasing taste
the atmosphere of the whole restaurant be very relaxed
most people come_here to sober up after a wild night at a club or bar
-PRON- only make_sense
-PRON- always go to jimmy 's when -PRON- want to get work do
-PRON- be sometimes hard to find a table especially if the back patio be close if -PRON- be be rain etc
the staff be very_friendly the americanos be just -PRON- style and on occasion the music be just right
-PRON- typical chinese takeout
solid and good
-PRON- always get takeout
so -PRON- can_not comment_on -PRON- delivery
but -PRON- be always quick to make the good usually 10_15_minute top where -PRON- hot and ready to be pick_up after call -PRON- in
also for lunch -PRON- can_not beat the portion -PRON- give -PRON- off -PRON- lunch specials menu for less_than $_5
good deal in_town
one thing to note imo even_though for the most_part this be -PRON- standard chinese takeout -PRON- do have the good hot sour_soup in all of cleveland
the place be bad compare to the greensburg store -PRON- have a long long way to go
customer_service be bad employee just do_not seem to care
-PRON- should be train by the greensburg staff
food be decent
be warn
on the menu and -PRON- say that there be twin lobster_tail with no further description
the two lobster_tail come pre cut and in a sauce
not what -PRON- be expect
2_star for the duck pond
bring quarter to feed the ducky
there be a duck food pebbl dispensary machine there
do_not feed the duck the quarter
1_star for both saks fifth and nike not to many store
-PRON- recommend head out there when the weather be nice
-PRON- be beautiful around the pond
the classic cheeseburger be one of -PRON- favorite burger ever
and the patio be amazing but everyone already know that
however the bartender be 10\/10 time a hole
so -PRON- try to stay_away
a great fine din experience
-PRON- have be to this_place several_time with -PRON- friend and -PRON- all love -PRON-
-PRON- get very_friendly service with a smile and delicious food

a few_year_ago -PRON- would of give 5_star
great oyster
the cheese fruit and nut appetizer be still wonderful
when make a reservation make_sure to ask for courtyard seating
if -PRON- want the las_vegas experience go here
there be no other way to put -PRON- nothing else to add
-PRON- be the place to be\/go
go for dinner
the only positive -PRON- find be accessible parking in noda and neatly design restroom
the beer be meh
everything be incredibly heavy on the bitter part of the pallet and -PRON- say that have do a flight
the hop dust wing be probably the most unappetizing chicken_wing -PRON- have ever have
to make -PRON- even remotely tolerable -PRON- have to douse -PRON- in sauce and even then the bitter bread make -PRON- gag
the beer cheese be grainy the fry rib be like jerky on a bone and the sausage have no flavor
to top that all off service be slow and -PRON- have to walk_around to find a host to seat -PRON-
normally -PRON- try a place at_least 3 time before review but -PRON- can_not stomach the thought of return
-PRON- be not the type_of person_who enjoy write bad review because -PRON- be highly aware that -PRON- be read by those_who care_about -PRON- business
that be say -PRON- hope this spark a review of the front of house and kitchen
take -PRON- dog here for daycare and have a good experience until -PRON- dog escape one morning
someone leave the dog door and outside door open
-PRON- run across to the lumberyard
-PRON- find out from -PRON- friend that have drop -PRON- off
luckily -PRON- friend find -PRON- the next night svar but unharmed in a neighbor shed
happy paws do_not call to apologize or offer visit
-PRON- understand thing happen however the lack of communication and concern bother -PRON- enough to not return even_though -PRON- still have pre pay visit
-PRON- believe -PRON- be good people but do_not handle this situation well
goodwill be awesome
-PRON- be spring clean time and this be the perfect place to get_rid_of all the knick knack clothing toy dish appliance etc that -PRON- swear -PRON- be go to use one day
-PRON- have donate thousand of dollar worth of stuff throughout the year and -PRON- prove a wonderful tax write off
when people come to -PRON- home the first thing -PRON- say be this look_like a model home
you have so_much space
and nothing be sit out
the reason for that be -PRON- hate clutter
if -PRON- be not use -PRON- -PRON- need to go
also -PRON- be difficult not to bring stuff back from goodwill
-PRON- be easy to drop_off then be tempt to buy something_else -PRON- most_likely do_not need
-PRON- be glad to see this store have expand -PRON- square footage
-PRON- keep -PRON- motivated to keep donate and de clutter
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- always try to have dinner at mix in_las_vegas when -PRON- visit
besides the great view the restaurant have excellent food and be usually pretty quite so -PRON- can enjoy a nice meal without all the vegas character
every_time -PRON- have be there the menu have have unique entree
there be always a_few great fish dish and other adventurous creation
a great place for a date_night
fantastic food and service
-PRON- husband and -PRON- both have the original philly with cheese wiz and red_sauce on the side
-PRON- add a side of potato wedge and -PRON- both get drink
the 8 sandwich be more_than_enough for each of -PRON- and -PRON- feel -PRON- be very reasonably_price for the food -PRON- get
-PRON- love -PRON- sandwich and want to lick the paper when -PRON- be do lol
the staff be super_friendly and attentive and -PRON- be clear that -PRON- really_care_about the experience and enjoyment of -PRON- customer
-PRON- will_definitely_return for more
seem_like a mom and pop shop at the bottom of a set of stair that -PRON- may not even notice on a baldwin street full of different cuisine atmosphere and price point
perfect day for korean as -PRON- be a chilly september day still do_not get -PRON-
at just after 7 there be only one other person in the resto which -PRON- be a little surprised about
-PRON- be guess -PRON- attract more people during the day and weekend
tasty free appie consist_of cold japchae marinate tofu and cucumber in_addition to mini bowl of pickle radish and kimchi good heat
-PRON- lunch_special be on all day
how awesome be that
set in -PRON- mind be the dolsot bimbipap and -PRON- be the deal of the day for $ 6.99
no -PRON- be not joke
seven dollar for a full stone bowl of hot sizzling goodness
what -PRON- be surprised about be that the rice be in a separate bowl not crackle to crispy grain at the bottom of the bowl
not a big_deal
-PRON- just dump the rice in afterwards along_with the sauce and combine -PRON- like a madwoman until everything be mix in
although -PRON- be not big on meat these day i have to say -PRON- be a tad dissapoint that the beef be very minimal like piece_of ground beef and -PRON- think -PRON- be suppose to be more like bulgogi strip
everything_else be delicious about the dish so boohyah
-PRON- also get japchae dinner portion and add pork to -PRON-
the plate at first do_not look very big but beware -PRON- be mislead and the lunch portion may be enough
the flavour be spot on and this be the first_time -PRON- see the noodle to be a little thin than what -PRON- be use to eat
probably would result into quick cooking time

can_not be mad -PRON- be there to make -PRON- safe
a privacy wall like a chinese divider would have be a nice_touch when -PRON- open -PRON- pant to look down
-PRON- think a_few customer see more_than -PRON- bargain for those customer owe -PRON- a dollar
-PRON- be pretty fast though
overall fast security line and a decent enough experience

-PRON- go during restaurant week
the place be not crowd but there be lot_of problem
this be a noisy place
-PRON- ask to be move away_from the bar but that put -PRON- next to a speaker
-PRON- be hard to hear the waitress
fortunately -PRON- leave as the live_music start
-PRON- be urge to get the meatball appetizer which -PRON- all order
three minute_later -PRON- be tell -PRON- be out
food be not deliver by the waitress but rather other staff

service be typically good though -PRON- can get crowd
chic clean and comfortable
the room be top_notch not ridiculously price and -PRON- avoid all of the smoke and nastiness of have a casino go at all hour downstairs
only_gripe be the distance -PRON- be from everything but honestly the quality make up for that minor inconvenience
-PRON- really offer a great respite from the rest_of the strip
and once_again the room or studio
as -PRON- think -PRON- be call be fantastic
-PRON- have a fantastic meal here
from cocktail through dessert everything be top_notch
the ingredient for each dish be carefully plan and -PRON- really show
-PRON- favorite be the chestnut gnocchi but other highlight be the gyoza appetizer the smoked mozzarella and spice ash crusted rack of deer
the service be friendly attentive and have great timing
the house sommelier be helpful in make a decision on what wine to pair the deer with too
the atmosphere here be cozy -PRON- be able_to talk and enjoy each_other 's company just the right_amount_of busy

great food friendly_staff
about the good ny_style_pizza -PRON- can get in the local area
eddie and ritchie really make this_place a good family neighborhood pizzeria -PRON- remind -PRON- very much of the kind_of local pizzeria -PRON- would find in the late 70 on long island
after a movie at amc -PRON- mom dad aunt -PRON- decide to have an_early dinner here
-PRON- have be here a_few time in the past
but -PRON- be be a good 3_4 year since -PRON- last_visit
-PRON- forget that -PRON- have paper on the table so -PRON- can doodle on -PRON-

-PRON- server be dan -PRON- be really friendly
for starter -PRON- order the calamari by -PRON- -PRON- mean -PRON- mom because -PRON- order calamari whenever -PRON- go out

for -PRON- entree -PRON- aunt shrimp portifino dad aged beef tenderloin spiedini mom originally want lasagna but -PRON- be out for the next hour ugh so -PRON- settle for chicken scaloppine -PRON- lobster ravioli
-PRON- aunt love -PRON- dad like -PRON- mom do_not_care for -PRON- keep eat off of -PRON- plate -PRON- like -PRON- as_well
not_sure how authentic -PRON- italian be but_hey -PRON- overall enjoy -PRON- dinner would definitely_return
fun but small get -PRON- name on a guest_list and arrive before noon
-PRON- post up on the edge of the pool
music be 90 edm music
drink be 40 for the big one
-PRON- be look_forward_to the view but all the day bed block -PRON- so that suck
-PRON- become pack pretty fast so get there early so -PRON- can grab a spot
-PRON- be not really a hot_dog fan but since -PRON- boyfriend find this_place -PRON- really like -PRON-
this be a family run restaurant and the owner be very_friendly and nice
the quality of these hot_dog be amazing and fresh
every_single_time -PRON- go there -PRON- try a different hot_dog and -PRON- be never disappointed
-PRON- see a lot_of review mention high price
-PRON- be $ 5.95 for a hot_dog make with really fresh_ingredient stack high and will fill -PRON- up along_with either a bag of chip or a side of coleslaw
-PRON- do_not_mind pay_$ 6 for a hot_dog here because -PRON- be worth -PRON- and pretty_much a meal in -PRON-
very yummy pizza wonderful alternative for takeout if -PRON- do_not want chain pizza
excellent local pizza_joint that do_not_skimp_on cheese
be there an option for 0_star
the name alone be a joke really
ninja city
this_place be overly price -PRON- can get a real bahn mi in chinatown for $_3
the staff do_not even look_like -PRON- be happy to be there
the food be sloppy and nothing on the menu be really asian flavor
disappointed in how -PRON- represent vietnamese food in cleveland
to -PRON- surprise(and disappointment
the springs cafe at the springs preserve be no_longer under wolfgang puck but instead now run by the culinary academy of las_vegas
-PRON- do stay within the same food guidline as the previous owner which be to continue to offer a sustainable dining selection
-PRON- go during the halloween festivity and there be a special halloween menu which be overprice and not really a good selection of item
-PRON- think -PRON- be odd that the boo burger do_not come with any veggie
no lettuce no tomato nothing
hello be not this_place be suppose to promote healthy eating
no veggie
why
so basically -PRON- get a bun a burger which seem_like -PRON- come_out of -PRON- grocer freezer and a slice of cheese
-PRON- remind -PRON- of food while eat in a school cafeteria
not $_9.00 worthy at all
the kid 's meal also have those darn freeze dino nugget and pizza stick that -PRON- can find at walmart
be the food fresh here or what
too_bad about the food as the view set in this restrauant be beautiful
-PRON- know the employee be student but whomever be instruct -PRON- need to step up his\/her teaching quickly or there will not be anyone to serve
food be very_tasty
excellent customer service.clean and pleasant
-PRON- will recommend this restaurant to -PRON- friend
this_place have a lot_of potential and hopefully will meet -PRON-
-PRON- love that -PRON- have -PRON- in tega cay
-PRON- have live_music on the weekend which be great
trivia night on thursday and other special
-PRON- go for trivium and peel and eat shrimp night
-PRON- be music trivium which be fun for the whole family
the peel and eat shrimp stink though
-PRON- be hot and bland
need some old bay or something
the wing salad and sandwich be all pretty_good
the wait staff be hit or miss
some be forgetful and slow
other be warm and attentive
-PRON- think the more people that go here the good -PRON- will get
great selection of phone but the mobile customer_service rep be beyond slow
-PRON- hate to be rude but -PRON- be obviously pay by the hour without shift goal
-PRON- love mexican_food but this be one of -PRON- favorite place to eat period
a few_week back -PRON- husband buy -PRON- home carry out order
and -PRON- be so pleased to see the portion be big with -PRON- carry out
pizza nova be -PRON- favourite pizza chain
the reason_why -PRON- be post a comment_on this specific location because -PRON- always go_above and beyond to make_sure -PRON- be satisfied with -PRON- pizza
-PRON- always receive exceptional service when -PRON- visit
the pizza delivery driver to be of vietnamese decent
-PRON- believe always show_up with a bright smile
can_not say nothing bad about this_location rock on guy
-PRON- would be put off go to bogeys for awhile
as -PRON- all know -PRON- have some turnover
-PRON- have be redondo 's and then ny 51 or something
so when -PRON- switch again -PRON- do_not think much of -PRON-
-PRON- have be off -PRON- radar for awhile anyways and despite the fact_that -PRON- be around the corner from -PRON- home
-PRON- do_not much care that another pizza place be resurrect the previous place mediocre food
finally -PRON- give -PRON- shot
and -PRON- be so_glad that -PRON- do
the service be great and -PRON- will feel_like -PRON- be at cheer if that be what -PRON- want
if not that_s fine too
there be plenty_of place to sit_down and watch a game or listen to good music on -PRON- huge_selection juke box
there be a couple of minor theme run through the place
naturally bogeys paint a golf image and -PRON- seem to be push a_little_bit of the irish pub thing too along_with plenty_of tv_'s for sport but the real draw be the good people there and the wonderful beer and food
-PRON- have possibly one of the good burger in the valley last_night
the menu be extensive
the bbq_pork sandwich be also out of this_world and the fry be the good around
-PRON- have garlic rosemary waffle and one or two other great alternative
and -PRON- have be put off the killer steak sandwich which -PRON- have hear from a_few
be the shiznit
so if -PRON- be look for a local place with regular people and great food give bogeys a shot
-PRON- will be back -PRON- be sure
-PRON- sort_of hide behind the jiffy lube in the strip_mall so do_not go judge a book by -PRON- cover
the beer_selection and food blow_away all the other local bar in the hood
the pizza dough be make by scratch and be local thank to mj bakery
-PRON- have the perfect crunch\/doughy ratio and be light yet flavorful
the meatball pizza be delicious and definitely one that -PRON- can_not seem to stop order
the meatball be slice thinly and be reminiscent of meatloaf rich hearty and well_season
-PRON- personally like to add ricotta just -PRON- thing
though beware -PRON- tend_to make the crust slightly soggy -PRON- do_not_mind
if -PRON- be in the mood to make a mess order the grill artichoke -PRON- swear -PRON- be worth the price
so happy that -PRON- can walk here from -PRON- house
the server be super_friendly and not too pretentiously hipster
-PRON- do with
-PRON- serve cocktail
-PRON- come_here for -PRON- dental need and love -PRON-
-PRON- be pretty modern tv in every room and the service be great
dr. sam be awesome and so be the assistant and hygienist
-PRON- be be vague here because -PRON- have have very little sleep
and -PRON- be late
forgive -PRON-
-PRON- recent experience -PRON- have to get a crown and -PRON- be cool that -PRON- get do in the office
-PRON- could even watch the machine that be saw away to make -PRON- fit in -PRON- mouth
sawing be inaccurate
the machine use pressurized water
how cool be that
-PRON- have be to las_vegas on 4 separate occasion and stay_at a different hotel every_time
in a 3 night stay -PRON- find a roach on 2 out of the 3 night
while the hotel offer a great rate on hotels.com there be no notation regard a renovated room vs a non renovated room
-PRON- be place over by the tour elevator and in a non renovate unit
the stay be mediocre at good and make bad by the roach
-PRON- kill one of the roach and take -PRON- to the manager on duty on sunday be 10\/9
-PRON- take offense at -PRON- attempt to make thing right by waive one night 's reservation fee of $_30
after some back and forth -PRON- make an adjustment to the bill for 3 night amenity fee
be that -PRON- be check_out and need to make -PRON- flight on time -PRON- reluctantly agree
-PRON- be truly disappointed with both the room the service and needless_to_say the roach
the minimal attempt to make -PRON- right make thing bad
-PRON- will not return to the stratosphere again
if -PRON- be stay there be aware of the tour section of the hotel nearest the tower
-PRON- frequent this_place with -PRON- fiancé
-PRON- love the food from the fresh salad to the pizza and everything_else -PRON- have try be always great
-PRON- always ask for nate to be out server because -PRON- by_far the good on -PRON- staff
-PRON- have other server and the food be always good but -PRON- be always good when -PRON- have great service
so if -PRON- be look to eat_here -PRON- would_recommend nate for a server
great pizza shame
-PRON- have to buy a whole pizza
not many option if -PRON- want to pop in for lunch

and the cappuccino be beyond delicious
everyone be super_friendly and -PRON- be not that expensive
love love love -PRON-
-PRON- love_this_place
-PRON- be so sad to see the one in little italy\/university circle go
-PRON- be such a great place to go get a delicious dish that be not fry or italian
so good
so when -PRON- start work downtown -PRON- obviously get super_excited to have tea house noodles at -PRON- fingertip almost literally
-PRON- take maybe 1.5 minute to get there now
-PRON- keep experiment with combination and nothing have really turn -PRON- off yet
ton_of veggie
the tofu be good not rubbery like -PRON- can sometimes be the noodle be fabulous and the service be great
-PRON- be so surprised to be greet_by a smile and quick service that do_not make -PRON- feel_rush
-PRON- have a hard time with decision and sometimes -PRON- need to stand in front of the menu to decide
that be not a problem here
and -PRON- can_not even explain_how refreshing that be
speak of refreshing this food just feel good
-PRON- be not heavy and with the way -PRON- eat -PRON- can get another meal out of -PRON- -PRON- keep well and can be re dress pretty well too
sriracha or some of -PRON- own sauce
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend this_place to a hungry downtown luncher or anyone_else for that matter and -PRON- will be get a lot_of -PRON- business
lotus of siam often refer to as the good thai_restaurant in america have by now garner a ton_of accolade and press
still -PRON- sit in an easily overlook and unassum strip_mall away_from the strip
the wall be adorn with famous celebrity as former patron
there be still a wait although much of that may be to create the illusion of a pack dining_room
-PRON- be not
-PRON- wait about_an_hour for a table for six although the table have be empty the entire time
the menu -PRON- be huge and include dish from northern thailand not find in -PRON- average thai_restaurant
base_on prior review -PRON- order the nam kao tod and the sea_bass drunken_noodle
-PRON- add on some typical thai plate such_as pineapple fry_rice pad_see_ew and the spicy garlic chicken_wing
the nam kao tod beef be good but inconsistent
some of the piece be perfect while other be more tough and dry
the must_try dish of the night be the sea_bass
the fish be perfectly fry but the drunken_noodle leave much to be desire
the pineapple fry_rice be and pad_see_ew be average
-PRON- finish with a mango sticky_rice for dessert which be amazing
the mango be as sweet as can be and the sticky_rice be top with just the right_amount_of lavender to give -PRON- a floral aroma with every_bite
overall the sea_bass be a bit_pricey and the other dish be okay but -PRON- be a good meal albeit pricey for thai
-PRON- have to return to try the garlic prawn
come with a group_of friend but come early so -PRON- can try as many of the 150 dish as_possible
that be exactly the pho -PRON- be expect
shrimp rice roll be tasty and fresh especially with sauce
-PRON- offer four kind_of sauce
as an east asian -PRON- will say this be exactly fresh and natural asian taste cater to those_who be not a big_fan_of oily food
beef in the pho be wonderful
-PRON- will_definitely come another time
food be beyond expectation especially consider the low price
-PRON- fav chinese_food in richmond hill
service be excellent price reasonable
only downfall no delivery
great customer_service
bobbie get -PRON- everything -PRON- need
i'll definitely send all -PRON- friend here
be here_several_time each_time have something_different and -PRON- be all very good with such a wide_variety -PRON- be rare for a place to make everything taste amazing
-PRON- be pregnant and live two city 's over and still make -PRON- boyfriend bring -PRON-
-PRON- be definitely_worth the drive and the cost
if -PRON- need a safe moved call arizona lock and safe
john and -PRON- team be extremely professional and move -PRON- safe without a single scratch
-PRON- be on time call before arrive and get the job do quickly and efficiently
-PRON- taco be the way mom would make -PRON- if -PRON- be mexican and be the most amazing cook ever
the take the filing put -PRON- in a corn_tortilla and deep_fry the whole thing
oh
-PRON-
gosh
just amazing
-PRON- have never eat anything_else here
the taco be just too amazing to try anything_else
-PRON- always get the shredded_beef
-PRON- do_not live in phx anymore but every_time -PRON- be here -PRON- make -PRON- way over to 7th ave and indian school
-PRON- be a_bit of heaven
note this_place be not fancy in the slight
-PRON- watch la reve 2_year_ago in_vegas and -PRON- can say that this show do_not measure up
if yelp give out half star then -PRON- would give this 2.5 star
-PRON- get 2 free show ticket with -PRON- room and could have choose_from 6 show
-PRON- dad choose this show without -PRON- know -PRON- would have much rather preferred to see love instead
the show have a story but -PRON- could_not tell what the hell be go on
-PRON- just seem_like different act showcas different trick follow each_other without_any real structure
the main character be this wizard dude who do absolutely nothing but sing
kinda disappointing because the lead of some other show -PRON- have see actually do perform
a lot_of the act -PRON- be enjoyable with the most impressive be the ladder duo or the acrobat at the end
the height that -PRON- balance and jump off\/onto be pretty breathtaking
with that be say some of the act be not up to par and be not really as imaginative or as dangerous as -PRON- be expect
have the show on a stage at aria be an interesting decision
-PRON- do_not_mind -PRON- as much
but -PRON- be not as immersive as the some of the other cirque_show at big venue
the good thing_about this show be that -PRON- be free for -PRON- but
overall -PRON- would_recommend choose a good cirque_show if -PRON- be in_vegas
how have -PRON- never write a review here before
outside of -PRON- own place this be the place -PRON- have be to the most in_toronto by_far
the good -PRON- be the hub of toronto
go train go bus and ttc all connect through union station
if -PRON- need to get anywhere downtown by subway or if -PRON- need to get anywhere around the gta and beyond chance be union station have a connection that will get -PRON- there somehow
the bad
-PRON- be old and stinky and crowd
during rush hour -PRON- be a mothereffin circus
definitely could use a face lift although -PRON- should not get_rid_of the beautiful architecture
-PRON- think -PRON- be in the middle_of clean -PRON- up now
-PRON- can get a little confusing move about
need a navigation app and good display map and sign
overall get the job do
barely
-PRON- love inner radiance spa and -PRON- be tell -PRON- be look for a new big good location in the area
shaly have give -PRON- the good facial and -PRON- have try all of the resort spa and many day spa
-PRON- use the good product eminence and be extremely sweet and intelligent
today -PRON- have -PRON- first adjustment from dr. g
and -PRON- will be back
-PRON- tell -PRON- husband -PRON- be worth the 20_minute drive
-PRON- have chronic shoulder pain and upper body tightness -PRON- know just how to treat -PRON-
-PRON- be at a different chiropractor for a year due_to -PRON- proximity -PRON- regret not move sooner
terrible terrible terrible
-PRON- barely speak to -PRON- and the technician do_not believe -PRON- when -PRON- say -PRON- do_not have acrylic on -PRON- nail
-PRON- file -PRON- wy to thin on the side -PRON- keep snag on everything no nail shape be the same
-PRON- will_never come_back here
of_course design in the same manner and decadence of the cosmopolitan hotel there be a tiny retreat nestled in the corner where -PRON- can forget -PRON- be inside a casino
-PRON- really like the space
couches everywhere leather a swanky little bar and a stellar staff
not only do the hostess address -PRON- by name but when -PRON- leave -PRON- remember -PRON- name
after only like 2 interaction
-PRON- think -PRON- be a nice gesture
-PRON- server very_friendly and eager to please
and -PRON- food be wicked delicious
-PRON- have the egg_benedict
-PRON- only complain be that price be a little high -PRON- only get the two muffin canadian peameal hard to find in an american restaurant egg and a thick and rich hollandaise sauce drown out the meal but that be -PRON-
no side potato or_whatev
and -PRON- be about 16 buck
-PRON- do include caviar
but -PRON- be not a fan
-PRON- have the dish san caviar
pair that with freshly squeeze orange_juice $_5 and -PRON- spend about $_25 with tip and tax
-PRON- feel a little_steep for -PRON- and -PRON- leave hungry still
nonetheless the food be spectacular and the ambiance pretty swanky
-PRON- like -PRON- and hope to return to try other dish
december 2016 update
-PRON- be right about this_place not be clean
-PRON- be fin $ 3500 by the health inspector for lack of cleanliness
search for montreal restaurant tous les jour inspection
=_=_=_= =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =_= the burger -PRON- be quite tasty maybe a 7\/10
however -PRON- have to say avoid this_place
the atmosphere here be what -PRON- would call prison\/slash\/gas station decor and make -PRON- want to get out of there as fast as_possible

always -PRON- go to car_wash
the vaccum be free -PRON- be 20 cent off the gallon with a car_wash purchase and -PRON- offer unlimited for 30$.

from the call for a reservation to the time -PRON- leave every interaction be absolutely perfect
the service beautiful cocktail and food be all absolutely wonderful
-PRON- can_not wait to come_back for happy_hour
-PRON- small_plate be pretty delicious especially the gourmet mac_n_cheese and the service be friendly and efficient

try every version_of the hot spicy peanut dish that -PRON- can chicken beef shrimp tofu
do_not forget to ask for water
-PRON- have be to itsy bitsy before and -PRON- be great
but -PRON- do_not_know_what happen today when -PRON- go today
come in around 12:05 pm
the lunch rush be not busy but there be several people din there
-PRON- could tell something be up when -PRON- walk -PRON- and -PRON- take more_than 5_min for someone to greet -PRON-
after be seat -PRON- then take_forever for someone to take -PRON- order and -PRON- actually have to flag the bartender down because there be no waiter\/waitress in sight
-PRON- think -PRON- order at around 12:25 pm
-PRON- feel bad for the bartender in front because -PRON- have to juggle watch the bar and take the order
after take -PRON- order -PRON- take -PRON- almost 30_min to bring_out the food
now -PRON- understand that this not -PRON- average raman in a bag\/bowl that -PRON- would eat if -PRON- be break or in college or -PRON- would hope so but -PRON- have_no_idea why -PRON- take so long
the table next to -PRON- who come in after -PRON- even finish -PRON- food before -PRON- come_out
now onto the food
potsticker be okay
-PRON- give -PRON- a 7\/10
as for the raman -PRON- be alright also 7\/10
for the price -PRON- be pay though -PRON- would expect more
10.50 be pretty expensive compare to place like monta raman and raman sora
-PRON- get the tonkotsu broth which be okay
but then -PRON- charge -PRON- for goofy stuff like chili oil
-PRON- do_not_know_how -PRON- can justify .75 for chili oil when most place give -PRON- to -PRON- for free
anyways 1.5 star for service today and 1.5 star for food
unfortunately unless someone demand that -PRON- go eat_here -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- enjoy a fancy happy_hour
be not economical like -PRON- usually think of happy_hour be though
really_enjoy the spicy mojito
but -PRON- be $_8 a pop
try the polenta fry
-PRON- do_not like the dipping_sauce the item say vegetarian but taste_like -PRON- have anchovy in the sauce
ick
-PRON- husband try the sweet_potato plank and enjoy -PRON-
the good be the 4 cheese plate
mmm
next_time -PRON- will just get that and a couple drink
-PRON- think with tax and tip -PRON- pay over $_60 for happy_hour
-PRON- have now have 2 dinner here and -PRON- much prefer eat_here than have dinner on the strip
the food be delicious and there be also a great wine_selection
-PRON- have never be to a thai_restaurant that take wine pair so seriously -PRON- be awesome
-PRON- most favorite dish be the braise short_rib khao soi
braised short_rib on_top_of egg noodle with the most delicious coconut curry ever
-PRON- definitely need some sticky_rice to dip in the sauce as_well
so good
-PRON- also really like the garlic prawn
very fried
so -PRON- recommend share this dish with a big group
1 be enough
nam kao tod crispy rice salad be a great starter
everyone seem to order this
and -PRON- be definitely for a reason
no reservation be take over the summer so get here early
-PRON- arrive with a group_of 8 at about 5:10 on saturday and be 2nd in line
by the time -PRON- open at 5:30 there be a giant line
by 7:30 when -PRON- leave there be ton_of people wait
great food
great lunch_special
food always make fresh and the enchilada be dank
great spot off central a little but outside of the main strip
would_recommend anyone_who love enchilada
great staff never have to wait more_than 5 10min for a haircut
-PRON- son 's stylist be chelsea -PRON- be super_friendly great attitude and -PRON- 17y\/o son love the way -PRON- cut -PRON- hair
love -PRON-
not -PRON- haircut
min be very_nice and cheery and -PRON- love that -PRON- take walk_in
but -PRON- wreck -PRON- hair
what -PRON- tell -PRON-
-PRON- want trim on -PRON- long hair with some reshape around -PRON- face
what -PRON- get
a bad 80_'s style shag with some serious breakage an inch long at the top and back of -PRON- head
probably should have stop -PRON- when -PRON- go nuts with the razor at the crown of -PRON- head
-PRON- advice for anyone_else with long hair be very clear on what -PRON- want and do_not be afraid to speak up
-PRON- really wish -PRON- have
-PRON- find -PRON- experience truly displease
the service be extremely unprofessional
there be several worker hide in the back and only one employee help customer
not only do -PRON- not have the phone -PRON- want -PRON- lie to -PRON-
-PRON- be tell that -PRON- could come the next_day and pick_up -PRON- phone without a question ask
the next_day -PRON- ask -PRON- several question in order to access -PRON- father 's account
-PRON- specifically ask -PRON- if there would be anything -PRON- have do the next_day and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would not
-PRON- also simply turn on -PRON- phone and assume that -PRON- have an icloud rather_than try to help -PRON- transfer -PRON- datum
extremely unprofessional service
the last_time -PRON- be here -PRON- go with two female co_worker who be mildly obsess with the idea of -PRON- date -PRON- waiter
-PRON- be no stranger to objectify cute male wait staff cough*roka
akor*cough but even -PRON- feel uncomfortable for -PRON- after -PRON- have to endure approximately 3 hour of merciless cougar flirt follow_by loud encouragement for -PRON- to take a more active approach to -PRON- date life by hit on -PRON-
-PRON- feel_like -PRON- be have dinner with -PRON- two pimp but -PRON- be a total pro about -PRON- and -PRON- end_up be an_incredible meal
-PRON- have be to sens once before where -PRON- have the most amazing pimm 's cup ever
-PRON- freak love pimm 's cups and only a handful of place in_phoenix serve -PRON- so when -PRON- get a good one -PRON- remember -PRON- vividly well as vividly as i can remember thing that occur on patio at 1:00 am on a saturday
after go for dinner a few_week_ago -PRON- have the same_thing and -PRON- be just as good even_though -PRON- be not nearly as drunk as -PRON- be the first_time
since -PRON- bac fluctuate like kirstie alley 's waistline that be about all the consistency -PRON- can ask for
-PRON- order a ton_of food which seem to mostly be serve small_plate style with 4 or 5 serving per order
this be perfect for -PRON- because -PRON- tend_to get bored easily and after a_few bite of the same_thing -PRON- be ready for something_else this may explain why -PRON- co_worker feel the need to take control of -PRON- date life
everything -PRON- order be fantastic
-PRON- start_off with sizzle shrimp in a spicy red_sauce
the shrimp be perfect and sauce be actually spicy
nothing piss -PRON- off more_than when restaurant cater to the wimpy mass by have -PRON- spice o meter equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer
the soup gyoza bacon wrap date sugar cane pork and bacon wrap okra be all just as good
for dessert -PRON- have bacon wrap lychee bacon be clearly the theme of the evening and -PRON- be pretty_much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal
even_though -PRON- have only be to sens twice -PRON- be slowly creep up -PRON- list of favorite restaurant in_phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as -PRON- visit more_often
maybe next_time -PRON- will not bring -PRON- pimp but no promise
service be good location on the strip be good the logistic of the parking_garage in relation to the hotel be not convenient
-PRON- can tell -PRON- an_old building but functional
the miracle mile shopping_center be very_nice to walk thru and shop
when -PRON- go for a time out the wynn be the one -PRON- choose
-PRON- a nice hotel and not expensive enjoy the pool and spa good weekend ever
i`ve be here a number_of time
come for the decor
food be ok
wait
staff be generally competent but the hostess always suck
as always give -PRON- location -PRON- get the king west crowd out in force which could be a good or bad thing depend_on -PRON- preference
would easily be close to a four_star if the hostess be change up
-PRON- finally drop in here the other month after -PRON- brother have be sing -PRON- praise for quite some time prior to -PRON- recent move
not want to go all in at first -PRON- stick with -PRON- cheap option the $ 5.99 jerk_chicken special also available in curry and bbq chicken as_well_as a veg option which include -PRON- choice of rice and vegetable side
the chicken be perfectly_cook moist unlike other place in the area with dry out chicken -PRON- be look_at -PRON- af1 and flavourful with the perfect_amount of heat
for the price the amount_of meat be considerable
the jerk sauce be on the sweet side which seem to be the most common version in_toronto these day but still pack a little punch
the ample amount_of sauce let -PRON- -PRON- soak into the rice and pea below give -PRON- an_extra boost of flavour
-PRON- have since return a couple of time and -PRON- be be just as good every_time
-PRON- will have to give some of -PRON- other option a try soon
save for a couple take out customer -PRON- be be absolutely empty every_time -PRON- have be in so there be not much in the way of ambience but the place have be immaculately clean on all occasion
the staff be super_friendly as_well especially the owner who seem to like to chat -PRON- up with the customer
love_this_place
this be the first mexican_restaurant in_vegas that -PRON- would actually return to
yes -PRON- be a little_pricey but -PRON- experience be well_worth -PRON-
delicious food and marg and outstanding service from everyone
thank -PRON- pancho 's
-PRON- have be lease acura 's for a number_of year and deal with hendrick acura for 5_year
-PRON- recently lease an acura rdx and -PRON- experience be top_notch
dean letorney be -PRON- sale advisor and -PRON- be able_to give -PRON- the number on the car in less_than 2_hour
-PRON- locate the rdx with acura watch in the color that -PRON- want within a_few day and -PRON- have a new car in a week
-PRON- can_not say enough about the level of service that -PRON- and hendrick acura provide
come_here with a couple of friend around 7 8 ish pm want to satisfy -PRON- sweet_tooth and to finish off the day out with -PRON- with a sugar high and full belly
the place have a cool and edgy interior with circular theme all around
-PRON- come in and -PRON- be quite surprised that there be not a lot_of people maybe 2 table of couple when -PRON- come in
-PRON- be kinda quiet too
maybe the busy hour be not until later when movie go ers finish watch stuff from the movie_theater near by
-PRON- come in and -PRON- do_not really get a good vibe from the staff
-PRON- be seat at the round booth which -PRON- think be really comfy and roomy
-PRON- definitely be not as enthusiastic and cheery as -PRON- expect from dessert place
-PRON- do keep check in on -PRON- which be nice but -PRON- do_not stay too_long
friend and -PRON- order -PRON- ny_style cheesecake with strawberry and strawberry sauce and -PRON- also order the chocolate lava cake and another cheesecake for take out will talk_about those take out item later
the cheesecake be dense just the way -PRON- like -PRON- and the tartness of the strawberry balance the sweetness of the sauce and the cake
-PRON- order this one because -PRON- catch -PRON- attention on -PRON- menu photo which have a lot more strawberry than the one present to -PRON-
-PRON- wish the slice be a_bit big consider -PRON- pay_$ 9 + for one slice
overall kinda underwhelm in consideration of previous cheesecake -PRON- have have the menu photo and the price 4\/10
-PRON- also order -PRON- nachos which come with cheese jalapeno pepper bell pepper onion the usual thing on nachos
come also with 2 mini sour_cream and 2 salsa sauce bowl
-PRON- decide to add bacon to -PRON- nachos which be additional cost
the course -PRON- be okay -PRON- have have cheesier hot and tasty nachos but -PRON- like how -PRON- be a 3-flavoured\/coloured nacho chip that -PRON- use
definitely add to the colour visual of the plate
by the end of -PRON- stay there -PRON- mouth be burn like crazy from the jalapeno and there be no re fill water_glass to be find
the take out item be okay
but -PRON- do_not think -PRON- will be do take out here anymore because of the high price for just the slices\/lava cake
no plating\/decor\/whipp cream\/ice cream\/sauce with the take out
this_place be most suit for dining in and eat -PRON- dessert
maybe -PRON- will come_back for those and -PRON- specialty drink
healthy
plant base and delicious
-PRON- can tell that the owner and staff be happy serve up great option to those of -PRON- who want something fresh and different
-PRON- take a omnivore friend to lunch here and -PRON- love all of the option that -PRON- sample
-PRON- even finish -PRON- wrap and two side before -PRON- finish -PRON- food
everyday there be a new feature wrap to_choose_from which -PRON- can check on -PRON- facebook page
everything be tasty so -PRON- can_not go_wrong_with whatev -PRON- choose
-PRON- can_not wait to come_back for the breakfast wrap
this be homemade vegan food and -PRON- be great
be careful when use_this_company
if there be several thing wrong with -PRON- appliance -PRON- will fix one item at a time
so -PRON- need to continuously call -PRON- back
in the end -PRON- still wind up with a broken unit
podunk company
-PRON- agree with other_review owner and -PRON- son be very rude
-PRON- go to nail_salon on the southwest side
-PRON- have go to about three_different girl so_far here and -PRON- have all do a fabulous job
the only_negative aspect about this salon be the time take
a recent_visit for an ombré paint fill take around two hour but end_up beautiful
if -PRON- want a good quality manicure or pedicure but have a_few hour to waste this be the perfect place to go
rebel republic be an absolutely fantastic spot that for whatev reason be not get the business that -PRON- deserve probably from a lack of advertisement
and -PRON- be slightly seclude location tuck_away in a shopping_center at w sahara and valley view
as a swing bartender most of -PRON- experience there have be during the graveyard shift
when -PRON- first step foot in there -PRON- be immediately marvel by the incredible draft_beer selection 52
not only that but several of the beer be on rotation so -PRON- know that every_time -PRON- go_back there be new thing to try
whereby the majority_of the staff be friendly knowledgeable and professional -PRON- have be most impressed_by a_few of the graveyard staff
larry be the first to break -PRON- into the incredible beer menu
-PRON- be so good with the beer that -PRON- often know_what to suggest to -PRON- base_on prior selection
some night -PRON- do_not_know_what to drink
so -PRON- tell -PRON- to send -PRON- on a craft_beer journey and -PRON- never_disappoint
-PRON- be also a consummate host always ensure that -PRON- clientele be comfortable happy and feed
as a gamer -PRON- enjoy -PRON- machine
the poker play very well although -PRON- have not have too_much success with any jackpot
however -PRON- can usually salvage a night with a fun romp with the video black jack
larry also turn -PRON- on to the food menu first start -PRON- off with the kobe slider
-PRON- be original delicious and full of flavor
also -PRON- be on the late_night happy_hour which be a fantastic program especially for those of -PRON- work late into the evening or morning
from there -PRON- move -PRON- onto other fantastic dish and sandwich
the tempura avocado be a personal_favorite of -PRON-
-PRON- never think that avocado would go so well in that style but with the help of the phenomenal graveyard chef antwan spelling
-PRON- be always a hit from -PRON- perfect crispness to the delicious dipping_sauce
while mention antwan -PRON- be so_much more_than just a cook
-PRON- always ensure that the guest be fully stock with silverware napkin or condiment of any kind and -PRON- be always open and friendly
although -PRON- have be there on other shift graveyard with larry and antwan be absolutely -PRON- favorite
-PRON- be so_much_fun that -PRON- have make a regular evening after work with a group_of friend on wednesday thursday morning
-PRON- suggest rebel republic as a gathering place whenever friend want to get together and try something new
-PRON- will_continue to frequent this_establishment and -PRON- hope -PRON- continue in the fantastic fashion that -PRON- have start
larry and antwan be incredible asset to this_company and -PRON- look_forward_to see -PRON- every_time -PRON- go
simply put the combination of great food an_amazing beer and drink selection and devoted and knowledgeable staff make rebel republic an outstanding destination for anyone look for a great spot offer excellence at any hour of the day or night
thank_god for -PRON- good service occasionally or this_place would be a total flop
sorry -PRON- say -PRON-
what keep -PRON- come_back be convenience -PRON- less then a mile from -PRON- house and -PRON- $_10 off $_20 purchase coupon that be always around
the food be okay
about the same as something -PRON- could whip up in -PRON- kitchen
okay maybe a step up
the service have always be iffy either wonderful or terrible and sometimes -PRON- take_awhile to get -PRON- food
small thing that peeve -PRON- every glass of soda\/icedt -PRON- bring -PRON- -PRON- add $_3 to -PRON- bill kinda cheesy but whatev
overall yeh -PRON- will go_back for some overpriced food in a handy to go tub
-PRON- want to visit this_place b\/c -PRON- see -PRON- on that episode of man vs. food and when -PRON- visit vegas -PRON- want a change from the restaurant available on the strip
-PRON- be a good experience the staff be super_friendly
-PRON- order 2lb of the spicy hot juicy crawfish and 1_lb of the king_crab some sausage corn and cajun fry
-PRON- be alright satisfy but definitely not the good -PRON- have ever have
the crawfish be pretty small and when -PRON- be small like that -PRON- have to work harder to get to the actual meat which kinda suck since the meat be super duper small
the crab be really good and -PRON- really like the sausage but -PRON- remember -PRON- be pretty expensive
-PRON- think -PRON- pay an_extra $_6 to get six slice of andouille sausage
the corn be the neutralizer which be necessary if -PRON- can_not handle the heat
the cajun fry be so so -PRON- next trip -PRON- will do w\/out -PRON-
next_time -PRON- would like to try the shrimp and maybe clam if -PRON- have -PRON- and -PRON- will probably try the medium instead_of the spicy
so -PRON- be not constantly ask for more water
-PRON- have be a long_time since -PRON- would be here although -PRON- can_not really remember why
because now -PRON- really want to go_back
-PRON- be here with some friend a couple of week_ago and -PRON- get a table outside after only a couple of minute wait
sure -PRON- look over whitney way and the parking_lot but -PRON- be a really nice outdoor_patio
-PRON- enjoy some appetizer to start
if -PRON- be wonder_if -PRON- should try to pork_belly bite yes yes -PRON- should
-PRON- definitely should
-PRON- also try the fry_pickle
-PRON- be good not too_much breading and still crunchy but not amazing

the parking be kind if ridiculous so park at the mall if -PRON- get a chance
-PRON- be not a far walk and -PRON- may need a walk after all the delicious food -PRON- eat
the front entrance be spectacular
-PRON- be a large wooden door that seem forebode like great castle door but also beckon like a siren call -PRON- to -PRON- delicious doom

the staff be extremely nice dr. whilms be professional and be great with -PRON- dog
-PRON- recommend anyone need a vet or animal surgery to go here
try to place an order on_yelp and -PRON- do_not go_through
so -PRON- figure -PRON- would call the restaurant
and -PRON- speak to the manager rachel who proceed to argue_with -PRON- for five_minute over whether or not -PRON- have put -PRON- credit_card in to the order
no_matter how many_time -PRON- explain that the order be not complete -PRON- do_not seem to understand or more accurately do_not want to understand
-PRON- will be call the place to speak to the owner in the morning to let -PRON- know that -PRON- miss out an order because instead_of simply take -PRON- order -PRON- get five_minute of attitude from rachel
-PRON- make_reservation for 10_p.m. know -PRON- close at 11_p.m.
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be the only one in the restaurant so service be very swift -PRON- waitress be lovely
both -PRON- boyfriend -PRON- order a special -PRON- get a ravioli and -PRON- get a burger
both be great
-PRON- only_complaint be that if a business say -PRON- be open until 11_p.m. -PRON- should remain open until 11_p.m.
by 10:30 candle be blow out flower be take off the table and the computer monitor be be turn_off
from the time -PRON- walk_in the door
-PRON- feel_like -PRON- be there too late to eat
staff be leave thing be be clean and -PRON- be only 10_p.m. on a friday_night
-PRON- sound as though another_reviewer show_up for dinner and find the door lock -PRON- would not be surprised if the lock be turn as -PRON- walk_out tonight half_an_hour before closing
-PRON- only make this a point because the mission of this restaurant seem to be one that really want deliver on atmosphere and the late_night visitor do_not get -PRON-
perhaps this restaurant should consider close early if -PRON- do_not want late business
otherwise food be great staff seem friendly
the decor be chic -PRON- seem clean would make for a great date_night
good advice
arrive_early check_out the special

in the middle_of -PRON- conversation with -PRON- -PRON- hear someone talk loudly and aggressively next to -PRON- so -PRON- look over and -PRON- be star angrily at -PRON-
-PRON- ask -PRON- what -PRON- have say and -PRON- act_like -PRON- have affront -PRON-
so -PRON- even more angrily boom -PRON- say get off your phone now
and move your dog now

-PRON- be utterly confused not just by -PRON- psychotic rudeness but by what -PRON- mean by that
-PRON- dog be lay at -PRON- foot under the table not in anyone 's way at all
-PRON- start talk_about how -PRON- be his table and his chair
and -PRON- have better get off the phone and be wave -PRON- hand and point at the chair where -PRON- have tether -PRON- leash all while -PRON- mom be talk to -PRON- in -PRON- ear
very disorienting
but finally -PRON- understand that -PRON- want -PRON- to tether -PRON- to a different chair even_though there be 40 other empty chair around -PRON- -PRON- could have use to seat the couple instead
in_fact the table -PRON- be be seat at already have two chair

-PRON- start go off about how -PRON- have_no_idea what -PRON- be talk_about
and -PRON- do_not respect anyone_else 's space
and -PRON- be take up two table

the fact_that -PRON- do_not have to call and wait on a response for age let_alone get call before -PRON- even call show -PRON- -PRON- friendliness be not just to get the sale"
-PRON- really be like this even after -PRON- have already purchase the vehicle from -PRON-
anywho -PRON- call -PRON- back tell -PRON- -PRON- could_not figure -PRON- out and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- could come over to the dealership right_away
and -PRON- would help -PRON- out
-PRON- help -PRON- within_minute of -PRON- call
-PRON- be in the parking_lot wait for -PRON- when -PRON- get there
finally customer_service be not laborious for someone
-PRON- think -PRON- be something -PRON- deserve when -PRON- be make a huge life purchase
then
-PRON- have not even own the damn jeep for 48 hour when some turd in a parking_lot scrap -PRON- back bumper and do_not leave a note to fess up to what -PRON- have do
slight body damage on -PRON- car before -PRON- could even put 60 mile on -PRON-

thank -PRON- for -PRON- help christopher
if anyone -PRON- know here need a vehicle -PRON- will be send -PRON- straight to -PRON- so -PRON- can have a stress free buying_experience like -PRON- do
two lunch item a goat curry and a jerk_chicken
the former be fairly straightforward the latter have a distinctive flavor different_than other jerk recipe -PRON- be not too hot for those unacquaint with caribbean food to try
-PRON- would definitely order -PRON- again
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- more for dinner than lunch
the husband and wife combo who run the place be very_nice
not a bad place but not a great place
get an order to go but -PRON- be out of the ham and forget the potato_salad
-PRON- end_up with pull_pork and smoke turkey
meat be okay and -PRON- be not impressed_with the bbq_sauce
-PRON- would try another place rather_than eat there again
-PRON- show on a saturday as a party of five
with a friend visit from -PRON- of town -PRON- figure -PRON- would take -PRON- to a_few neat spot
the bar_area be really nice the lounge area in the back be beautiful
-PRON- really want to like -PRON- -PRON- really do
approach the hostess ask if -PRON- could sit_outside
advise no -PRON- only have seat for four
be -PRON- that hard to pull_up a chair
so -PRON- be direct to the lounge area in the back
-PRON- be show to two lounge type seat for four people and -PRON- hand -PRON- a wooden din room table for -PRON- fifth
but that could_not be do on the patio
-PRON- look over the menu decide on drink and even on a small_plate
-PRON- sit for five_minute no one ever come
so -PRON- leave
walk right past the service station make eye contact with a server as -PRON- pass
nothing be said
not even a hey -PRON- will be with -PRON- in a second
nothing
yet another spot to not return to
ever
review be for restaurant week 2015 menu
restaurant week give -PRON- the push to try lao sze chuan
-PRON- probably would not have stop here but for -PRON- being on the restaurant week list
-PRON- menu actually be four course and -PRON- have flexibility with -PRON- offering
after ask for the restaurant week menu the server bring -PRON- to -PRON- and explain that -PRON- could mix both the appetizer and the main with small_portion so -PRON- could try more
instead_of get three pot sticker -PRON- be able_to order 1 shanghai egg_roll 1 chicken egg_roll and 1 pork pot sticker
for the main_course -PRON- be allow to get half portion of any two dish
so -PRON- order the three chili chicken and the lemon shrimp
-PRON- opt_for the hot and sour_soup and for dessert -PRON- order the coconut ice_cream
-PRON- iced_tea be bring quickly and -PRON- take the time to enjoy the beautiful room
-PRON- be very_nice
soon a gentleman bring -PRON- hot and sour_soup
when -PRON- be halfway through the soup -PRON- server bring -PRON- the appetizer
-PRON- just do_not understand this lack of serve separate course that -PRON- have experience in asian restaurant twice during this restaurant week period
the hot and sour_soup be very good
and -PRON- wish -PRON- have some time to savor the flavor after finish before have to dig into the appetizer
the egg_roll be ok
the pot sticker be a_bit of a letdown
one side be not completely do and have a doughy taste
with the appetizer -PRON- get soy hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce
the main_course be large serving
a full serving would be a large amount_of food for sure
the lemon shrimp be very good and consist_of 11 shrimp if -PRON- count correctly
the three chili chicken be good
but -PRON- be not as spicy as -PRON- like
what kick there be come from crack pepper in the batter and hot sesame oil
the plate have a lot_of oil from the chicken
the coconut ice_cream be very good and a nice way to end the meal
the ice_cream not only have a coconut flavor but also have toast coconut flake mixed throughout
very refreshing
the service be a mixed bag here
-PRON- server rachel be quite good
-PRON- bring -PRON- a fresh iced_tea when -PRON- first one be only half finished
-PRON- be very pleasant have a great smile and if -PRON- have be do all the serving -PRON- have a feeling the soup and the app would not have overlap
this could be a four_star place
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- watch the course and space -PRON- out a_bit_more
-PRON- be in and out of the restaurant in just over 45_minute
give -PRON- a little more time to savor the separate part of the meal
draft house definitely have the small town vibe go on where everyone know everyone_else and gossip run rampant anytime someone walk_in the door
-PRON- come_here by -PRON- for a lunch break in between home visit for -PRON- job and when -PRON- walk_in -PRON- feel_like everyone turn and look_at -PRON-
-PRON- seat -PRON- in the front room that be separate from the bar and a waitress come to -PRON- right_away to hand -PRON- -PRON- menu
-PRON- have the blt with fry and -PRON- be tasty
-PRON- be not blow -PRON- mind
-PRON- just be good
-PRON- be tough to get a blt wrong
the fry be good the waitress be quick and -PRON- be in and out within 20_minute
-PRON- appreciate the speediness as -PRON- be on a schedule
if -PRON- find -PRON- in the area again -PRON- would definitely stop_by again
-PRON- be good_than fast_food that be for sure
great food and service
-PRON- all try_something_different and share
food and service be a+
the pizza slider wing cheeseburger
-PRON- be well_prepared and whoever be the chef make -PRON- great point to insure great tasting food
great place before the game just across the street
all of -PRON- will be back beh
everything be delicious
the molcajete be the bomb
waitress be very_helpful and good service from all the restaurant free complimentary fish tostada delicious
the horchata be the good -PRON- ever try
very busy place
order for large_group and staff be very_friendly and accommodate
leave and get a call that -PRON- forget an item so drive back and -PRON- meet -PRON- outside with item
excellent local find
very_disappointing -PRON- be still irritated
-PRON- pay_$ 8 for a small mocha with the banana purée -PRON- offer which sound great
-PRON- get -PRON- half sweet also ask for double shot of espresso
-PRON- order with the barista the drink come and although -PRON- have a pretty heart on -PRON-
and -PRON- really be shocked that -PRON- taste no coffee no essence of espresso just basically a hot_chocolate
the cashier be someone different now when -PRON- politely mention the mistake and ask if maybe -PRON- forget to put in the espresso which happen a lot
-PRON- work at starbucks
-PRON- kind_of ignore -PRON- and try to tell -PRON- -PRON- can_not taste -PRON- with the banana which be nuts because -PRON- be an an avid coffee drinker of all type and i know a small latte base beverage with a double shoot coffee should be taste
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- half sweet
so -PRON- know -PRON- be not the sweetness hide the coffee
then -PRON- say -PRON- could_not get -PRON- half sweet which -PRON- laugh that -PRON- would say such a weird thing
simply less chocolate seem obvious
the barista do_not get involve just confirm -PRON- do put in the shot
and -PRON- dismiss -PRON- concern flat out
the problem be the drink be not right
and then -PRON- suggest for -PRON- maybe -PRON- could just add another shot to fix this flavour at_least not to mention the caffeine -PRON- really need
the barista then argumentatively say -PRON- have to pay just to be clear
-PRON- be not try to get anything free but know -PRON- be drink a hot_chocolate and not a coffee seriously lack customer_service here and there be ton_of other place to go to in the area and -PRON- feel rob and brush off
-PRON- tell -PRON- that be ok
-PRON- will just never come_back
-PRON- be the customer and -PRON- be walk on eggshell to spare -PRON- feeling about -PRON- lousy drink only to have no recovery
and -PRON- have already take -PRON- money
this money be hard_earn and the disregard blow -PRON- mind
-PRON- throw out the damn coffee a block later
and the funniest part be -PRON- work in film and -PRON- be shoot today on college st and -PRON- be pretty hilarious that -PRON- could return to a film set and tell everyone do_not go to film cafe
so enjoy the result -PRON- make with the terrible impression -PRON- put on -PRON-
really too_bad since this be what -PRON- get for skip tim_horton 's and support local
bullshit experience
-PRON- shoulda buy a taco across the street instead
food look really good on the table of other 's huge portion except -PRON- never make -PRON- to -PRON- table
go in on a sunday_afternoon with not much rush place an order right_away and wait about 55 minute with absolutely no_idea where -PRON- order be and the single staff server say -PRON- be come in 2 minute or completely avoid eye contact
pay for -PRON- coffee and leave an_hour later table in front of -PRON- also have leave without -PRON- food
ridiculous customer_service with no_apology in the end
viva el taco be very close to -PRON- house
-PRON- have be -PRON- preferred taco shop for 7 year
despite come_here very regularly the staff act very indifferent to -PRON- for year
eventually the woman_who take -PRON- order start acknowledge -PRON- but make comment like wow how can -PRON- eat the same_thing all the time
well why would -PRON- care -PRON- be give -PRON- business
still -PRON- remain loyal_customer until -PRON- most_recent incident
-PRON- be with friend and -PRON- decide to order nachos and a ton_of taco for sharing
-PRON- husband go to pick_up the food and the same employee who usually ring -PRON- up be there
-PRON- make a comment about how -PRON- have start order a lot more food than in the past
yes as mention before -PRON- have be come_here for year and -PRON- have two kid and have gradually start order more food
so -PRON- husband say yeah -PRON- have the kid now and -PRON- son can eat a whole burrito by -PRON- and -PRON- respond -PRON- do_not_know if that be a good thing at that point -PRON- decide -PRON- be do give this_place -PRON- business
-PRON- do_not need someone look_at -PRON- order and calculate what -PRON- be eat what amount etc
really wonder_why -PRON- would not just appreciate -PRON- regular business instead_of make snarky comment
very_friendly helpful employee
have the house coffee and wife have a vanilla latte with coconut milk
both very good nice comfy sit place
first -PRON- have to say that -PRON- have only be once and only have appetizer several as -PRON- be with a group on business
-PRON- have cocktail pizza and several of -PRON- cheese and meat tray
-PRON- be not excited to go as -PRON- use to have a north in -PRON- neighborhood in glendale and be not impressed
-PRON- have also be to the scottsdale location and the white leather super modern motif do_not really do -PRON- for -PRON-
the food be always just ok too especially for the price
thing have change
the north in arcadia be set_up to look_like a rustic italian kitchen
-PRON- give major kudo for the pasta be freshly make by hand
the cocktail -PRON- be have call the quiet italian gentleman be a fantastic mix of rye amaretto and two other italian liquor
yum
another cool note be that -PRON- use a hand crank deli slicer to slice -PRON- meat in order not to melt the wonderful fat in the meat
-PRON- have never see this before and enjoy the touch
pizzas be fair to good but pizza be a tough nut to crack
-PRON- think -PRON- have every meat and cheese -PRON- offer
every one be quite nice
the only draw back be that -PRON- be hot inside which be apparently a problem as the manager come by to advise that an_additional unit be be instal so this should not be an_issue go forward
-PRON- server be also excellent
-PRON- will be back
ps parking be valet only which annoy some people
not -PRON- since -PRON- be complementary and make -PRON- feel special so -PRON- worth the couple buck tip
like any_other eat n park
a great local diner chain with much good food than the national
sign say the food be source from local farmer in the summer
a good thing because western pa grow some of the fine produce in the country
visit last_night thursday
the patio be cute nice romantic chill ambiance
-PRON- be the main_reason -PRON- decide to try -PRON- out
the food be a complete disappointment
-PRON- order the frite which be basically hard chip with a spicy sauce on_top yuck
the tomato dish be okay but overprice 5 slice of tomato with some seasoning for $_12
finally the veggie quesadilla have barely_any cheese inside and the tortilla taste awful and plasticky
also $_5 for a piece
drink be okay nothing_special though
needless_to_say not come_back
not -PRON- favorite but always worth a stop if -PRON- find -PRON- at tempe marketplace
while -PRON- be clean enough and have a nice topping bar -PRON- have few flavor than other shop in_town
-PRON- seem -PRON- always end_up disappointed in the choice available that day
but -PRON- do somehow manage to find enough to overfill -PRON- cup
my_god
if -PRON- be one thing -PRON- want to bet on while -PRON- be in_town this weekend
this be -PRON-
and by bet i mean make a sure bet of $_14
the only risk involve be miss the opportunity to order this as -PRON- be serve during_lunch fri sun 12pm-5pm
duck_confit cinnamon_roll
w\/ smoke bacon frosting and raspberry compote
the frosting be make with bacon dripping and -PRON- put on a fair amount without overwhelm the dish entirely not that i would mind
underneath the icing be bit of shredded duck meat that could have be easily overlook but those few salty spec add another dimension to this rich bakery good
top off with a raspberry compote and -PRON- get -PRON- a wild card in -PRON- face
fancy
the two thick slab of grilled pork_belly pair on the opposite end of the plate will have -PRON- mouth gamble for a compromise
in the end the climax would solidify because there be no reasoning
each mismatch bite just seem to get good and good
-PRON- can_not even recall the last_time i have cinnamon_roll or why -PRON- would stop eat -PRON-
with sentimentally -PRON- have regret the absence of these sweet roll but thank to comme ca i can once_again tally this into -PRON- current streak
this_place be great
-PRON- get the meat and cheese board sweet_potato bravas and short_rib
the service and food be wonderful
well -PRON- make -PRON- way to tee pee last_night
and -PRON- be an experience to say the least
-PRON- be on the net at work the other day and watch a teaser for some new show that andrew zimmern be come_out with
the episode -PRON- be watch be shoot here in_phoenix at the tee pee restaurant
-PRON- of_course order the chile relleno
-PRON- think -PRON- look interesting so -PRON- plan a trip to check -PRON- out
-PRON- mother and -PRON- arrive and walk_in and have a seat in one of the booth in the back room
this be where the wheel come off the evening
the booth be to say the least uncomfortable
-PRON- mother be only 4'10 and -PRON- whole body be under the table
all -PRON- could see be -PRON- head stick up and -PRON- look rather unhappy
-PRON- then try another table and find much of the same
-PRON- be not a small guy and -PRON- be have problem with the fact_that the seat be a_bit to close to the table for -PRON-
-PRON- then try a third table and find the same_thing so -PRON- just stay there
finally a couple leave at a table next to -PRON- and -PRON- move for the forth time and this be much_more comfortable
-PRON- order the green chili chimichanga and -PRON- mother order the machaca burro
-PRON- both come_out pretty_quickly and look very good but -PRON- be a_bit on the small side
-PRON- mother burrito be much large
-PRON- try -PRON- chimi and find the first_bite to have a strange flavour
-PRON- be something like a strong sour after taste
not pleasant
as -PRON- eat -PRON- way deeper into the chimi -PRON- do get much good but still be not the good -PRON- have ever have
big complaint be the shell on the chimi be not crispy at all
-PRON- be use to a chimi shell which be deep_fry have a nice crunch to -PRON-
this be pretty mushy and soft
-PRON- mother try -PRON- burrito and be very_pleased_with the flavor
-PRON- have a nice soft tortia and the meat look very_nice
-PRON- reach over and have a taste and -PRON- be very good
if -PRON- would have know -PRON- would have order that instead
-PRON- also order a chile relleno to go so -PRON- would have a chance to give that a try since -PRON- look so interesting on the zimmern show -PRON- have see
-PRON- finish -PRON- meal and pay and leave take -PRON- football size relleno with -PRON- for later
-PRON- arrive home and have to take a bite of the chile relleno
-PRON- be not good
-PRON- be nothing but cheese with chile lay on_top with a ton_of whip egg_white over -PRON-
no flavour at all and the texture be just not appeal
-PRON- have 3 bite and throw the rest away
that be $_9 waist
all and all -PRON- would not go_back to tee pee
there be so_many mexican place here in_phoenix that kill tee pee in flavour and portion_size and -PRON- have booth that be much_more comfortable
-PRON- have an_amazing time at little blackbird skin care
this be -PRON- first facial and -PRON- do_not_know_what to expect but -PRON- be completely blow_away
carrera be professional and extremely knowledgable about the product that -PRON- use
-PRON- take particular care of the blackhead on -PRON- nose and use the utmost care in make_sure the blackhead be eliminate
-PRON- recommend a moisturizer that -PRON- purchase from -PRON-
and -PRON- could_not be happy
-PRON- only want to help -PRON- and do_not push product on -PRON- which be why -PRON- have shy away_from go to place like massage_envy
-PRON- face have never feel good and the moisturizer be fantastic
-PRON- will_definitely recommend carrera and little blackbird skin care to all of -PRON- friend and family who be in_town and who will be visit
the food have definitely go down hill
-PRON- do_not get what -PRON- pay for
the food be not as flavorful as -PRON- remember -PRON- to be
this be definitely not the place for wing anymore
a dump
room be make for dwarf
fremont street band rock through the room face fremont til 2 4am
most room have no tub just a mini shower that look_like -PRON- have lead pipe
swamp cooler in 115 degree heat
yeah
that get -PRON- down to 95
elevator door almost take -PRON- hand off when -PRON- try to stop -PRON-
a dump
-PRON- absolutely_love this store
there be so_much variety and everything be very well organized
the store be very clean which be always nice
-PRON- be a fairly new store so there be some sparse area on the shelf
-PRON- will_definitely_return for the product alone
-PRON- be such a home decor\/ organization junkie
however the staff do_not seem very well train
-PRON- have work retail before
and -PRON- know whenever people enter the store late -PRON- be frustrating because after a long day of work -PRON- just want to go home
but -PRON- customer should not feel that from -PRON-
-PRON- walk_in around 8:50pm and the store close at 10_p.m.
-PRON- see a total of about six different employee through -PRON- time walk the store which be about 45_minute
not one of -PRON- greet -PRON- or ask if -PRON- need help find anything
-PRON- ask an associate a question and -PRON- answer as -PRON- be walk_away from -PRON- which -PRON- find rude even_though -PRON- may not have realize what -PRON- be do
-PRON- be young and may not have much customer_service experience
again after -PRON- encounter -PRON- there be about four other associate that just walk pass -PRON-
the bad part of this trip be at checkout
-PRON- be in line one customer be help and four other a couple a mother and -PRON- two kid and a lady with a return and -PRON-
the cashier notice the line get long
and -PRON- believe -PRON- call for help
the second cashier walk up in no hurry and -PRON- be both ring up at a slow pace
a third girl walk_in from -PRON- break up to the register between -PRON- and another customer log into the computer sip on -PRON- soda -PRON- get on lunch or break and just ignore the line
when -PRON- finally get to the register -PRON- ask if -PRON- want to sign_up
and -PRON- ask if there be a way -PRON- could do -PRON- at home
-PRON- look_at -PRON- for a_few second almost annoyed that -PRON- ask the question and then say if -PRON- want to so -PRON- just say ok -PRON- will do that
-PRON- pay cash -PRON- hand -PRON- cash back but do_not count -PRON- back to -PRON- and say have a good night
-PRON- pass another employee on the way out who also do_not acknowledge -PRON-
again -PRON- be obsess with this store and will_definitely_come_back but the customer_service need some work
lemongrass be locate inside aria hotel right_next to blossom
-PRON- come_here for lunch two day_ago with a party of about_10
the service be awful
when -PRON- sit_down there be no waiter to be find anywhere near by
-PRON- keep have to turn -PRON- head back and forth just so -PRON- can wave one down
-PRON- have to walk to the hostess stand to ask for some menu 's to look_at
by the time the waiter come -PRON- be ready to order
-PRON- order the thai_tea as -PRON- beverage
-PRON- take almost 10_minute to come_out
the thai_tea be not sweet enough
-PRON- have have good
-PRON- boyfriend -PRON- share the jellyfish and the lemongrass prawn as the appetizer
-PRON- do_not recommend the jellyfish
-PRON- be too largely cut that -PRON- be so hard to chew
-PRON- wish -PRON- be thinly slice
so the lemongrass prawn come_out
and -PRON- look_like a fishcake or something
so -PRON- ask the waiter what -PRON- be
and -PRON- say fish cake
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not order that and that be order prawn
so -PRON- add that in as_well
then the prawn come_out and -PRON- be an eggroll prawn
there be 3 different waiter at this table and -PRON- be all say different thing
finally -PRON- verify that -PRON- be the lemongrass prawn and just turn_into a mousse
the lemongrass prawns be actually pretty_decent
-PRON- be just a hassle to figure_out_what everything be
as -PRON- entree -PRON- order the drunken_noodle with seafood
-PRON- be okay
the portion be kind_of small
there be not enough flat noodle
-PRON- be about $_20 for this dish
-PRON- think this restaurant be pretty pricey for an asian restaurant
and -PRON- be not even satisfying
go there again for lunch
the selection be very poor with huge section of the conveyor belt be empty
thankfully if -PRON- ask the chef -PRON- prepare whatev -PRON- want
-PRON- be not_sure_why the selection be not out on the conveyor
but -PRON- still get what -PRON- want
and -PRON- be delicious
this tour be awesome
-PRON- leave stuffed and satisfied
-PRON- stop at three restaurant where the sample be not sample
-PRON- be practically entree
-PRON- last stop the fourth stop be a coffee\/pastry shop and the cookie be to die for
the tour be definitely_worth every_penny -PRON- spend
-PRON- also opt_for the alcohol sampling and that too be pretty awesome
the tour consist_of walk at_least 1 2 mile so please be prepared and wear comfortable shoe
try this on saturday while -PRON- be in_vegas and -PRON- be look for something to eat for lunch walk_in there be multiple line alternate deponga on what -PRON- plan to order
if -PRON- want al pastor -PRON- go in one line and any_other kind_of meat -PRON- go to a separate line
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- both order 2 taco de al pastor each and a small side of carne_asada fry
the fry be not that great that be why -PRON- be not get the full 5_star
-PRON- do_not have enough cheese and be mostly cover in -PRON- avocado sauce and although -PRON- be good -PRON- like -PRON- carne_asada fry to be cheesy
now the taco be absolutely_delicious
fresh hand make tortilla and the meat be delicious -PRON- wish -PRON- have order more taco and skip the fry
great burger
comparable to in n_out
the fry be fresh and very_tasty
a small order of fry be good enough for two people
absolutely_love this store
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- be addict the owner be awesome -PRON- always have a great selection of game
-PRON- do_not live close but try to find a way to make -PRON- down often

fast friendly service even on weekend with a refreshing vibe and cool decor around the resteraunt make this -PRON- family 's favorite breakfast diner
stumble across the lovely victory 's during -PRON- free play and stay package from the station casino
there be no wait
and -PRON- be seat_right_away which be always a plus
after accumulate so_many point -PRON- friend be able_to score -PRON- a free room along_with some food voucher that give -PRON- $_25 off any restaurant locate within the casino
well -PRON- actually pick this_place by default because -PRON- be so late and everything_else close at either 9 10 pm
glad -PRON- do -PRON- have pretty_good service for the most_part and some amazing fish and chip
order that along_with the catfish platter and mozzarella stick everything be super fresh and come_out in a very good time
do_not have any room for desert
but -PRON- be sure that would have be just as good as the rest_of -PRON- meal
this be by_far the good mexican drive_thru in the area
-PRON- favorite be -PRON- super nachos
-PRON- have never have a bad meal when eat -PRON- food
-PRON- no_longer live in the area and -PRON- miss -PRON- food -PRON- have yet to find a place here in the monterey peninsula that come close to the quality of food at filibertos
every_time -PRON- be in the az
-PRON- go to filibertos
-PRON- hear incredible review of tamarind before -PRON- go so -PRON- have pretty high_expectation
-PRON- be pleased to report that -PRON- expectation be totally meet
-PRON- get the garlic naan rojan josh and chicken tikka_masala serve with basmati rice
all of -PRON- be good but the tikka_masala be by_far -PRON- favorite
creamy and full of amazing flavor
-PRON- 2 4 and 6 year_old love -PRON- although -PRON- be a wee bit spicy for -PRON- 2 year_old
the industrial decor be on point and the service be good
tamarind be definitely go on -PRON- list of favorite restaurant
thank for a completely delicious dining_experience
-PRON- be here the other night
and -PRON- be not impressed
joyful house be overprice and overhyp
-PRON- have a fry flounder with sweet and sour sauce the special of the day $_22 and honey_walnut shrimp
the honey_walnut shrimp be good but lack for the price
the flounder be a mess
-PRON- come soak in cheap and unpleasant sauce that come straight from a bottle
-PRON- be not even surprised when the check come
and -PRON- be charge_$ 8 more for -PRON- $_22 flounder because -PRON- have use an entire bottle_of sweet and sour sauce
needless_to_say -PRON- be not happy with be charge_$ 30 dollar for an item -PRON- order under the clear impression
-PRON- be $_22
overall -PRON- check come to $ 56 include a $_4 sprite
if the floor be make of marble and the ambience be that of a 5_star restaurant -PRON- could see get away with this
but this be china town off the strip folk
there be hundred of amazing ridiculously reasonable chinese thai and japanese restaurant in close proximity
this restaurant be a tourist trap
chinese local do_not eat_here
-PRON- manage to find a groupon deal for flavor
before the groupon -PRON- be tell to go to try place like the wicked_spoon the buffet at the wynn and bacchanal buffet
even_though -PRON- have great rating and review -PRON- be still in_vegas on a budget and dinner buffet price be steep
flavor be pricey as_well but buy the groupon -PRON- still make out good_than the regular price because aycd alcoholic beverage be include
the groupon allow -PRON- to jump in the reward member line and get special seating
-PRON- be great because the line to be seat be short
the service be very slow but the server be very_friendly
maybe -PRON- be understaffed that night
but -PRON- only be able_to get 2 drink a piece because the drink server pretty_much have to serve -PRON- whole area alone
-PRON- guess -PRON- be good that -PRON- get two drink a piece versus zero
so the groupon be not a total waste
but -PRON- be still not happy that -PRON- could_not have more drink
the food be really good
there be so_many option to_choose_from asian mexican italian seafood soul food
-PRON- be all delicious
-PRON- be so stuff that -PRON- could_not indulge in the dessert but -PRON- boyfriend let -PRON- try some of -PRON- ice_cream and the strawberry ice_cream be bomb
-PRON- would be great if -PRON- have a groupon like this the next_visit to vegas because -PRON- would definitely_come_back
-PRON- would try to come to dinner early
so -PRON- would have more time to indulge in food and drink
hopefully service speed up as_well
-PRON- love the atmosphere of this_place -PRON- really make -PRON- feel at home
pretty_good beer_selection and a great walleye fish fry
-PRON- get there just a hour or so before close
so -PRON- be not busy at all
-PRON- be not really put out much fresh food because the lack of guest in the dining_area
the employee be really nice though and come over to -PRON- table to ask if -PRON- want a certain type_of pizza to be make
the server recommend a certain type and -PRON- agree
-PRON- be a very small buffet of food and small dining_area
by the look of -PRON- -PRON- look pretty run_down
the food be not all that good but be not all that bad
50 50 to -PRON-
-PRON- be the last to leave out and -PRON- do_not feel push out the door
so that be very_nice to not be rush
-PRON- do_not have a bad_experience but -PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- would go_back to this one
maybe try another
food here be pretty inconsistent
-PRON- basically order the same_thing every_time the -PRON- love salmon yet the quality have be different every_time
when the place first open -PRON- be great
the past_few time however the fish have be serve either a little too warm at room temperature or too thin seem_like -PRON- can see through -PRON-
the rice sometimes be too hard
the fish be also cut irregularly sometimes -PRON- be a good size other time -PRON- be really tiny
the last_time -PRON- come_here however -PRON- be really good
the portion be just right and the temperature of the fish be good
there be not too_much too complain just small thing that make this_place not completely satisfactory
overall still probably one of the good sushi place on campus
very unusual taste for a commonly name korean restaurant
-PRON- may observe that some the staff be chinese but from korean descent northern china probably and the food actually reflect this aspect
long_story_short korean food with chinese particularity
consequently what -PRON- would traditionally order from a korean restaurant will taste different_than expect
first note that menu be very rich and contain as many chinese and korean dish
-PRON- opt_for a $ 34 bbq meat selection for two
despite the familiar korean name of the preparation the sauce use be way more soyu base than usual korean food
-PRON- thus feel that the fusion be interesting and very personal
note that the food come with the traditional side_dish such_as kimchi
aside_from what -PRON- have there seem to be some interesting lunch_special
not an outstanding experience but differently worth try for a lunch
as a parent emcc be great -PRON- son finish -PRON- aa degree and have no_problem transfer to asu as a junior
the price be great and the class availability be great but -PRON- have to register early
find this_place on_yelp thank yelpers!)- a little off the beaten path
-PRON- be lucky_enough to snag the last indoor table on this chilly night as the majority_of the place be outside_seating
-PRON- can_not wait to come_back on a nice day
enjoy the craft
beers-
-PRON- have the rosemary ipa
good variety_of food include sandwich burger salad flat bread various app and other item
-PRON- really like the tamale and tater_tot
cute local restaurant
-PRON- will be back
amazing_job great customer_service
-PRON- use -PRON- twice second_time just the other day -PRON- be skilled master at -PRON- trade
in a world of lousy customer service\/lousy job do -PRON- be so refreshing to deal with accurate tree service
-PRON- almost wish -PRON- have more tree
so -PRON- could give -PRON- more business
-PRON- rate be great the crew be dynamic
hard worker great work ethic professional great job\/cleanup
-PRON- rarely say this about any company
but -PRON- love accurate tree service
if -PRON- do_not use -PRON- -PRON- will be a loss to -PRON- -PRON- will make -PRON- -PRON- wallet smile
-PRON- be sunday 330am and no line
how lucky be -PRON-
where_else
but vegas where -PRON- can get this kind_of meal at this time of the day
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- share the 1\/2 dozen oyster new england clam_chowder and the bouillabase
-PRON- know -PRON- be famous for -PRON- pan
roast but -PRON- boyfriend
and -PRON- favor more of a broth like broth vs creamy
omg
everything be so amazing
-PRON- be afraid of how large the oyster be because normally the one -PRON- have have taste off but these be so sweet
the new england clam_chowder be of_course very creamy and comforting
and lastly the bouillabase be mouthwater delicious
the broth be so flavorful and there be so_many chunk of seafood fish crab scallop and shrimp
if -PRON- ever get the chance to come_back_again at an off time -PRON- will_definitely be back
5_star for the waitstaff and the picadillo platter
the price be great
-PRON- be a great place to stop_by while run errands- not so_much a place -PRON- want to hang w friend at -PRON- go on a date_night
the interior be basic cafeteria style and -PRON- do_not_care much for the chipped side plate -PRON- know -PRON- add ambiance and charm but from a health stand point those crack harbor bacteria
-PRON- still stand by -PRON- 5_star for the food price and service
cheer
petit resto\/boutique de pâtisserie\/boulangerie coréenne sympatique
les pain fourré aux fromag
et autre viand m'ont fait penser à ceux de coco bun
je ne m'y connai pas dan ce monde sucré\/salé asiatique et je n'ai pas été flabergasté par les produit mais mon amie venant de séoule
m'a fait découvrir le bing soo
c' un genre de bol de glace râpé plus fin qu'un granité on dirait des flocon de neige sur lequel on peut
y déposer fèv rouge fraise mangue chocolat ou appareil
à base de thé
le tout est couronné d'un peu de lait condensé et de petit boule de gâteau
au riz ayant une texture faisant penser
à un gummy bear
oui
ok
ça semble étrange comme mélange mai la magie opère en bouche
surprenant rafraîchissant et léger
à essayer si vous passez dan le coin
ok
this be -PRON- first_time to the new bo
the place be modern and southern
just what the bo need
this concept should serve bo well go forward
-PRON- have be here_twice within 1 week and -PRON- have instantly become one of -PRON- top 5 favorite restaurant to visit
-PRON- will break_down -PRON- joy below
food
great
-PRON- have be to new_orleans so -PRON- be not shock by some of the offering since -PRON- do seem to try to keep to traditional nola food
the only_thing which -PRON- do mention be that the spiciness be adapat for the northern palate so -PRON- be not as cajun as -PRON- may expect
the good
the red_velvet bread_pudding change -PRON- world seriously just try -PRON- out
atmosphere
-PRON- love the look feel and vibe of this_place
-PRON- be invite jovial and a lot big than -PRON- would expect
-PRON- be shock by how large the inside be
-PRON- also play live_music in the bar most night
the only issue be that the one band be incredibly loud and -PRON- second_visit be near the front of the joint
-PRON- allow the band to continue play loud and -PRON- could_barely hear eachoth
-PRON- even tell -PRON- about -PRON- and the waiter seem to agree but nothing be do
while -PRON- appreciate the music -PRON- be still a restaurant and not a club
service
great
both time -PRON- seem that the waiter enjoy work there and be nothing but nice
price
-PRON- be a little expensive
-PRON- can get by with a cheap tab if -PRON- stick to -PRON- flat bread start at $_9 and dessert but -PRON- will_definitely end_up pay at minimum $_15 most above 20 a plate when -PRON- be consider entree
-PRON- love mexican_food so even average food will probably garner 3-star from -PRON-
-PRON- would say this be pretty average
everything be good nothing be disappointing except maybe the tortilla but nothing be crazy good either
-PRON- will say that while the price be affordable -PRON- would not call -PRON- cheap
this type_of food be not expensive to make nor difficult to prepare so -PRON- think $ 4.20 for a single taco for_example be too high
combinations run about_10 buck specialty dish $ 12-$15
expect to pay about $_8 at lunch
overall not a bad place to go
-PRON- will most_likely return if in the neighborhood
-PRON- want to like this restaurant so_much
-PRON- go on open weekend and several_time since then
-PRON- tough to find a place with a drive_through that
s fast that be not gross
-PRON- want to like -PRON- but -PRON- can_not
-PRON- do have positive and negative
pro -PRON- do have delicious bread
flavorful fresh and lovely
make for a good foundation for a sandwich
-PRON- always be very clean
-PRON- do_not_skimp_on avocado that make -PRON- happy
avocado be tasty
good iced_tea too
con
-PRON- ask several people if any of -PRON- soup be vegetarian friendly
-PRON- be reassure by 4 separate people that -PRON- be 2 bite and a queasy stomach cramp later -PRON- learn -PRON- be not
-PRON- bring -PRON- to the attention of the manager and be tell that none_of the soup be vegetarian and give a half heart feel sorry
-PRON- have to ask -PRON- to refund -PRON- for the soup -PRON- could_not even eat
-PRON- do_not occur to -PRON- that this would be the good course of action
-PRON- menu be limit in -PRON- flexibility and -PRON- attempt to customize to meet -PRON- veggie need be only successful half the time
-PRON- have to bring -PRON- food back a lot to be remade after meat be on -PRON- sandwich or in -PRON- salad anyway
the value of what -PRON- get versus what -PRON- pay be not the good but -PRON- be sure for many this be a great place to go just not for -PRON-
stop_by since -PRON- have never be here and -PRON- have a coupon to use
be greet and tell about the sale
-PRON- do_not find anything -PRON- like in -PRON- size and as -PRON- be leave the cashier be star at -PRON- foot
like really
-PRON- do_not say anything
but -PRON- be definitely insult
-PRON- will_never return to this store again
check_out the infamous bacchanal buffett on a busy friday_afternoon around 1 pm
-PRON- be seat after a 25 minute wait and -PRON- server promptly take -PRON- drink order
coffee iced_tea and oj be all include alcohol be not inclusive but be reasonably_price
assortment_of bottomless drink for $_18
the variety_of food range_from pizza seafood salad assorted cheese pasta sushi and dessert
-PRON- stick to the sushi sashimi and roll salad and seafood
do_not forget about dessert
-PRON- even have sugar free option
the only_thing -PRON- do_not particularly care for be the hot and sour_soup
-PRON- be cold and not traditional hot and sour_soup
-PRON- will most certainly be back for dinner or breakfast next_time
-PRON- be in_vegas
come for the overpriced mediocre taco
stay for the atrocious service
first and last_time for -PRON- at this_place
go_through the drive_thru and after be tell to wait a minute by the speaker -PRON- wait over 5_minute to place -PRON- order
also the order be wrong
and in a town with truly outstanding street taco these be not remotely worth $_3 per taco
maybe the burger be good
-PRON- will not be back to find out
-PRON- wife and -PRON- really want to like this_place base_on all the stellar review but unfortunately have to leave dissapoint
-PRON- come_here on a thursday_night at about 6_p.m. and order the love boat

the cucumber inside the salad be quite obviously leave over from when -PRON- shave the outside of cucumber to make roll as -PRON- be just thr circular core of the cucumber
there be miso_soup and also another small soup with some_sort_of noodle
the boat come_out and -PRON- think -PRON- be over sized for the amount_of food that sit on_top
-PRON- have a plastic tree in -PRON- as decor but -PRON- find that useless
there be a significant amount_of escolar wax fish if -PRON- do_not_know_what this be please google odd colored salmon and a small amount_of special sashimi really just one shrimp
most of the sushi piece have a smearing of mayo make -PRON- wonder_what be -PRON- try to hide as mayo on nearly every piece_of sushi be just weird
the rice in the sushi piece be all irregularly shape
almost as if -PRON- grab random handful and squish -PRON- down
seem very amateur as i can make similar sushi rice at home and that be not say a lot
sushi rice be overly_sweet and squished sign of to much vinegar and too_much mix as i could_barely make out the grain
every piece be pretty irregular in shape and size
in not say every piece have to be perfect but at_least try to be consistent in -PRON- dish serve
some place like -PRON- small some place big
-PRON- have not see mismatched salmon sushi piece before
sashimi piece be all cut irregularly and also quite a_few look discolor possibly because -PRON- squish a lemon slice on_top
the acidity perhaps cook -PRON-
wasabi be weak and powdery possibly low grade or expire
tea be very water_down
-PRON- do give -PRON- 4 spring_roll on the house
the server be very very_nice sadly -PRON- sushi chef be not up to par 3_star for service 2_star for sushi
for what -PRON- pay could have easily go elsewhere more satisfying
great salon if -PRON- want a funky\/edgy cut and\/or colour
everyone here know_what -PRON- be do and will give -PRON- exactly_what -PRON- ask for this be hard to come by with short challenging haircut

escargot pie nothing_special
crispy duck_confit more meh

the prime_rib be extreamly fatty and the rib be all fat
none_of the desert be make in house and -PRON- even watch -PRON- unload store buy donut on the tray
also the ice_cream be not at a cold enough tempature and the topping be lousy
-PRON- think the mainstreet station would have be a good place to eat
-PRON- have never be to this_place
a friend call and tell -PRON- -PRON- be come over and that -PRON- would bring something for -PRON- to eat
-PRON- arrive with pollo campero -PRON- would never even hear of -PRON-
so -PRON- proceed to try -PRON-
-PRON- have fry_chicken rice fry and bean

the fry be fry

better_than any_other chicken period
-PRON- fry_chicken look very similar to kfc but taste way better and -PRON- do like kfc a lot
again -PRON- have not be to this restaurant
but -PRON- can promise -PRON- will be go very very soon
-PRON- love the food completely
cerna be an_amazing company to work with if -PRON- or -PRON- love one need any assistance in -PRON- home
all the caregiver provide excellent service and strive to do the good
very_friendly and knowledgeable -PRON- would_recommend cerna to anyone_who be look for the good care out there
not for the picky_eater
stop in for a drink before head elsewhere for dinner
the drink be a very heavy pour(alway appreciate but could_not decide on on an_appetizer because of the choice
-PRON- be not the picky_eater in this group but just a fair warning to those_who plan on dining at this_place
decent place but doubt -PRON- will venture back
the food be tremendous
-PRON- should definitely make_reservation as -PRON- get a lot_of walk_in from the mall
the menu be really extensive and the wait staff be great at tell -PRON- about off menu option so -PRON- be not restrict
the dessert tray be amazing and -PRON- would_highly_recommend saving room
definitely take a moment and stop in worth the try
this_place be clean people be fun and -PRON- nail look great
the design be really nice and the price be great
-PRON- happen upon the restaurant on a trip to scottsdale and decide to give -PRON- a try

-PRON- go during off peak hour so the line be not_too_bad
there be a line of approximately 10 people an_hour earlier
even with the line service be pretty quick and efficient
friendly
maybe not so_much
-PRON- believe uno mustachio excel in -PRON- breading and deep frying
both the veal and eggplant be thinly slice and bread
-PRON- maintain excellent crunch without be too greasy
like other have mention -PRON- would opt in for the hot pepper
-PRON- really add a much appreciate heat element to the sandwich
the pepper also add some moisture to the sandwich
a common minor complaint be that the sandwich be a_bit on dry side
ask for pepper or extra sauce help
overall a very good parmigiana sandwich
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- get much good
-PRON- still give the nod to california sandwiches since -PRON- enjoy -PRON- red_sauce and freshness
sometimes -PRON- feel the sandwich at uno mustachio end_up sit under the heat lamp and lose some flavor as a result
try to get a fresh one
unfortunately this restaurant deserve the rating that -PRON- have
service be spotty and the food be so so
pre meal chip be mostly stale
-PRON- waitress seem frazzled and when -PRON- ask for a drink menu -PRON- say -PRON- do_not have one because -PRON- be revamp -PRON-
-PRON- seem annoyed to have to explain the different kind_of margaritas available
dissapoint all the way around
love dr. burke
the selection be amazing and the staff be so helpful
come in on a saturday and -PRON- fit -PRON- in
would_highly_recommend this_location
-PRON- always think that east_coast long island new_york bagel be the good until lox stock bagel move to mccormick ranch
absolutely_delicious
ny can_not hold a candle to -PRON- product especially -PRON- bagel and bialy
-PRON- have have -PRON- bagel breakfast lunch item etc
no other place in the valley can compare to -PRON- always fresh and deeelicious food
excellent service never a wait
good coffee in_town
once -PRON- try ls&b -PRON- will not go to another bagel shop
j.s.
lucy be one of the good wait staff at the grille
linda one of the bartender be also awesome
great view and good food
the pasty be super heavy so be prepared but obviously delicious
-PRON- favorite thing there be actually the salad
the one with indian chicken on_top be bomb and so be the greek salad with salmon
the dessert be all amazing too and -PRON- be a great casual place to grab a beer
-PRON- grow_up on a small island theater show only 4 movie at a time so -PRON- can understand -PRON- simplicity
come_here remind -PRON- of an episode of be -PRON- afraid of the dark
not that -PRON- dark but how -PRON- lay out
outside ticket booth movie title in large letter and large glass window in front
large lobby and high ceiling long hallway stretch leave to right lead to the movie there have to be at_least 20 view room
-PRON- have be to a_few movie_theater here in_vegas and most of -PRON- do_not have the same look or feel
because -PRON- in hotel casino or shopping_center
also like -PRON- because -PRON- not so crown or near a casino and have comfortable seat
-PRON- often show international movie here late filipino movie and -PRON- see a big movie sign for an indian movie
giant soda cup that do_not fit snuggly in the cup holder and be refillable
and who do_not love chow down on hot butter popcorn and sweet sugar candy while enjoy a good movie
-PRON- eat some good eat around the area also
as -PRON- write this review -PRON- be salivate on -PRON- screen just think about that smooth spicy creamy and most delicious spicy miso_raman
-PRON- have try the spicy variety at almost_every raman shop in_town and no one even come close to touch ryus spicy miso broth
-PRON- be depth and complexity be something that be incredibly unique
-PRON- can_not necessarily vouch for the more classic bowl like shoyu or shio because -PRON- could never get -PRON- to order something_else
-PRON- be too good
-PRON- personally love to pair -PRON- bowl with the garlic shallot oil white fungus and chop cha shu
the server be just the cut thing and -PRON- have become such a regular that -PRON- have -PRON- order memorize
and of_course an_extra bonus that keep -PRON- come_back be the point card which -PRON- have have many a free bowl of raman thank -PRON-
as mention -PRON- have play around with the menu and slightly raise price but -PRON- will_continue to be a loyal_customer as long as the spicy miso_raman stay the same
go here
poor service
have to wait about_15 min with no service
so -PRON- leave do_not have
any wait staff approach -PRON- at -PRON- table
can_not comment_on the food though
what a fantastic event this be
-PRON- be a little skeptical heading over because -PRON- be not that into bubbly
but what -PRON- experience last_night be just outstanding
each dish -PRON- bring_out be not only beautiful but taste great with the bubbly -PRON- give -PRON-
well -PRON- will say -PRON- could have skip the piece_of broccoli
-PRON- favorite be the cheddar cheese and bacon
w\/ the spicy mustard and those macaroon
-PRON- could have eat all 5 on that plate and still ask for more
-PRON- feel great to be back at a yelp elite event again for the first_time in about 2 year
look_forward_to the next
thank nikki for a wonderful event and as always a shout_out to tonya for those great pic
waste of time
-PRON- wil never see the guy there and -PRON- lucky if -PRON- find a spot to move
the place be so tiny and crowded
in -PRON- opinion -PRON- be the bad 5_min of -PRON- life i spend inside
wow
if -PRON- be a fan_of unique meat and a purpose build burger this_place be for -PRON-
unlike burger place where -PRON- build to -PRON- ideal burger bareburger be all about the signature burger
great flavour combination on the menu and very_tasty dipping_sauce for those_who dip
and if -PRON- ask request -PRON- have a really_cool secret menu that be be design just for toronto maybe even a canada only_thing
fast friendly service
infinite ice_tea american style
great add to the neighbourhood
maintenance issues
this hotel be in need of update with fresh paint and caulking in the bathroom
-PRON- be start to show -PRON- age at 17 year_old
-PRON- be look tired
the staff be nice and -PRON- be clean not sparkle clean but acceptable
-PRON- bathroom sink water be extremely slow to drain probably the stopper be clog with hair from the past 17 year just a guess
-PRON- be usually big_fan_of embassy suite hotel
-PRON- visit this hotel with a convention group
let -PRON- just say this hotel be not prepare for the 3000 woman in -PRON- convention
the hotel suite -PRON- be self be top_notch
-PRON- have a remodeled kitchen with a huge jacuzzi tub in the bathroom
-PRON- only disappointment that with such a nice kitchen there be no kitchen ware
no fork no plate nothing
why have a nice kitchen in the room and not include these thing
the service in the hotel restaurant be lack
-PRON- be really not prepared for so_many demand woman
include in -PRON- room rate be a nightly manager 's reception where everyone be give 2 free drink ticket
-PRON- think -PRON- will re think this next_time
this manager 's reception completely overload the staff
-PRON- be not please
that when -PRON- check into the hotel -PRON- put a hold on -PRON- credit_card for the full room rate for -PRON- stay + an_additional couple of hundred buck for incidental
-PRON- be write this review 3 day from when -PRON- leave the hotel and that hold have still not be take off -PRON- credit_card
on a normal visit this hotel would probably have be top_notch
with -PRON- large convention group -PRON- be go give an average rating
overall ok don't come in during late_night happy_hour
or -PRON- get nothing but attitude from the bar staff
have to beg to pay as -PRON- be more interested_in talk
such a great experience
parking area be big and easy to find parking
the staff be all really friendly and very informative with any_question -PRON- have
very clean and with ton_of shade and water fountain and snack bar
so -PRON- can keep cool
definitely will try and make -PRON- back here on another occasion
a place for all age for sure try out the 4d theater -PRON- such a kick and the camel ride -PRON- offer be definitely an experience -PRON- even get to pet dale
-PRON- also have an area where -PRON- can go in where little squirrel monkey be roam around -PRON-
thank again for the fun
this_place be a huge_disappointment
the pita be soggy the topping be not fresh- lettuce be wilt and very old looking
the falafel be leave out what taste_like all day and microwave instead_of be fresh cook
just terrible
-PRON- have everything figure_out with 5_minute leave to go
dark pesky electronic lock keep -PRON- from finish
-PRON- be a fun night and -PRON- will be back
-PRON- have have a positive experience at the store before but not today
-PRON- get -PRON- upgrade move up by customer_service then go into the store to get a phone and meet one of the manager
eduardo
stay_away_from this dude as -PRON- get really close to -PRON- when -PRON- speak will tell -PRON- thing over and over discuss internal affair idgaf just tell -PRON- if -PRON- can help
-PRON- leave the store and call customer_service back and -PRON- phone will be ship tomorrow
sticky toffee pudding be amazing
skip the whisky sauce on the chicken and haggi -PRON- be good with out -PRON-
-PRON- go on a thursday_night
-PRON- top shelf margarita be very watery
the chip and salsa be not that great
the salsa be pretty bland
-PRON- husband enjoy -PRON- taco and burrito combo but -PRON- veggie fajita be very oily
beau petit bistro charmant service très plaisant et plat plutôt bien exécutés et de qualité honnêtement
la liste de vin est trop courte et pas très inventive mai les prix sont correct
hélas l'endroit e situé dan un no man 's land assez navrant et il faut vraiment avoir affaire dan le coin aller à_ce resto
what can -PRON- say
hmmm
fez be a happy place -PRON- have a hipster vibe -PRON- almost seem_like the happen place to be in this part of town
-PRON- visit to the establishment be run of the mill -PRON- stay close by -PRON- be a short walk
the customer_service be slow and -PRON- be due in large to the sheer volume of people at this_place -PRON- be close to fire marshall shut_down full
when -PRON- recognize this situation -PRON- typically order drink and the meal together to help all out
-PRON- order the fez burger spicy fry and a margarita
the burger be say to be and -PRON- quote wildly popular -PRON- taste_bud relay to -PRON- brain and mouth average at good
the spicy fry be good but -PRON- really be ensure -PRON- waistline do_not grow as the portion_size be small
the margarita be needle point sharp good
wow that damn thing be amazing
-PRON- sit_outside because the weather be perfect
-PRON- like to people_watch and -PRON- be noisy inside plus
-PRON- have -PRON- late book with -PRON-
with the large volume of people the slow service and small_portion size -PRON- have to rate this_place three_star
-PRON- have nothing against the lgbt community as -PRON- motto for the most_part be live and let live except when -PRON- see crime against woman and child and other violence
fez be support well by the gay community there be ton_of couple on date and quite a_few of the waiter and waitress appear to be apart of the community so if -PRON- be not at a place of accept other different_than -PRON- -PRON- would not partake of this_place
-PRON- mean no harm or ill will
take -PRON- easy breezy
anyone_who be fan_of middle_eastern cuisine will appreciate the delicious variety_of meat and vegetarian_option at bamiyan kabob
the restaurant be large and keep clean -PRON- place -PRON- order at the front and the staff call -PRON- when ready
the food take about_10_minute to prepare but come_out nice and fresh
the platter be large and be serve with naan rice salad and -PRON- choice of meat
-PRON- have the lamb while -PRON- father have the tandoori chicken
both be tasty and flavourful and neither of -PRON- could finish -PRON- plate
would_definitely_recommend the dinner or even one of -PRON- many wrap which -PRON- have have on a previous occasion
-PRON- know those weekday morning where -PRON- be gross and rainy and cold outside and all -PRON- can do be think about how warm and delightful lunch will be
so -PRON- head out to find the perfect place but -PRON- can_not find anything and instead end_up with some overpriced salad that be 99 lettuce and 1 miscellaneous
well if -PRON- have go to anton james -PRON- would not be in this mess
-PRON- have only try -PRON- pre_make lunch with chicken\/salmon veg and a potato puree but -PRON- be tell -PRON-
this be exactly_what -PRON- need if -PRON- need a little pick -PRON- up
sure -PRON- be oily and buttery and probably not the healthy thing under the sun but -PRON- can promise that after finish this meal -PRON- will be happy as a clam at high tide
-PRON- also have sandwich and pizza on the menu which judge by these other meal -PRON- be sure be fantastic
good stiff vodka base drink here
the bloody_mary be almost a meal in -PRON-
-PRON- like the casual atmosphere and the expansive booth for group
the high ceiling faux constructivist mural and red lighting make this_place very dramatic and almost transport -PRON- back to moscow
the only_downside be that water service be sloooow and -PRON- do_not have russian standard any more
-PRON- come_here after hear_about this_place from a_few other yelpers and make a point of come_here today for the first_time
-PRON- be on the lookout for a 3 quart saucepan as mine be on the fritz
unfortunately -PRON- do_not have one
so -PRON- get a candle while -PRON- be there
-PRON- really like -PRON- here for a_few different reason
the selection be nice and -PRON- gently use kitchen equipment
all of thi stuff seem to be in really good shape
-PRON- have a_little_bit of everything from pot and pan to bar stuff some dish cookbook and other assorted kitchen item
even_though -PRON- come up empty handed -PRON- would gladly come_here again
staff be friendly selection be great and price be fair
this_place be on -PRON- short list of consignment shopping store
o beware parking be a little tight here
hmmmm first_off wifi be not free
-PRON- have to pay_$ 13 -PRON- believe everyday for -PRON-
for -PRON- review -PRON- will say the hotel -PRON- be very beautiful and staff be nice but other_than_that at_least for these hot summer month i do_not think -PRON- be worth the stay
to get to the hotel be confuse in -PRON-
there be not that many sign display indicate where the actual lobby be while drive there
and if -PRON- do_not do the valet parking -PRON- have to self park and then go_through a maze of the resort to even get to the front_desk to check in
-PRON- be july and the temperature be reshape over 100 degree and -PRON- swear the pool be probably 90 degree
the pool be so warm -PRON- feel disgusting to even be in because -PRON- offer no refresh coolness to the unforgiv hot summer in az
-PRON- think for such a nice resort -PRON- would keep the pool at at_least 70 degree when -PRON- be 100 + outside
so needless_to_say -PRON- get in the pool for about 3 minute and get out
-PRON- also do the water activity while -PRON- be there paddle boarding kayaking etc which be really neat
however get to those be again yet another maze through the resort
no sign list
nothing on the brochure on how to actually get there do_not_know if -PRON- have to schedule a session or just show_up
the experience be cool but again -PRON- do -PRON- around 9_a.m. so -PRON- be already about 90 degree and even_though the keep the little river all chlorinate and clean the river -PRON- be about 90 degree and not refresh to cool off in at all which make the water activity pretty miserable
try call guest service at 8:30am and the phone keep ring try call the reservation line and -PRON- give -PRON- a busy tone
then eventually -PRON- call the resort number to have no one answer and be tell to leave a voicemail
honestly -PRON- just think -PRON- be disappointing
-PRON- be really excited to stay_here because -PRON- friend have fly in
if -PRON- be stay_here between the month of september may -PRON- be probably worth -PRON-
but to stay_here in the summer
have fun swim in a 95 degree pool when -PRON- be 103 outside
-PRON- have the best chirashi_bowl in_town hand_down
year_ago -PRON- would order this and -PRON- be only $_15 buck
no one know about this
and -PRON- think -PRON- be such a bargain because -PRON- come in a big bowl of full on sashimi with soup or salad
-PRON- think -PRON- be -PRON- little secret
so whenever -PRON- come_here -PRON- always order -PRON- since -PRON- love -PRON- so_much
-PRON- be very_generous with the type_of fish as_well
then after tell -PRON- friend about this or -PRON- would see -PRON- chirashi order come_out who also have the same love for sashimi like -PRON- do -PRON- now all order -PRON- too
-PRON- guess -PRON- gain popularity and attention from the owners\/worker since -PRON- would have like a table of 4 order of just chirashi_bowl at_least 2x or 3x time in a week
that be a lot_of sashimi
but -PRON- be so good
maybe rusan 's pick_up that this be too_much of a bargain and up -PRON- price to $ 17.95 consider other sushi place around_town at the time 2_3 yrs ago
be overcharge chirashi_bowl for $ 22-$25 for a small dinky bowl of raw_fish
what -PRON- think be a steal now be no_longer a steal
-PRON- be a little upset
-PRON- would do this
but -PRON- be still a good deal in_charlotte whenever -PRON- be crave sashimi so_much
then last summer -PRON- increase the price up to $ 19.95 um what
-PRON- come_back last month
and -PRON- find out -PRON- take the chirashi_bowl off -PRON- newly update menu
but -PRON- still order -PRON-
find out
-PRON- charge -PRON- to around $ 22.95 or something like that now
what a bummer
-PRON- will not be surprised if -PRON- keep increase -PRON- to $_25
oh_well -PRON- do_not bothers -PRON- now since -PRON- do_not go there often but look to -PRON- like -PRON- do_not want many_people to order -PRON- anymore if -PRON- have take -PRON- off the menu
although -PRON- be a little upset of the increase price -PRON- have to say for the most_part the chirashi_bowl be always extremely abundant impressive
this_place always have the good sushi and app as_well
-PRON- be also not that pricey at all
and -PRON- can get pretty full without spend a lot
service however sometimes suck
-PRON- be never know for -PRON- service so do_not even_bother review about -PRON-
-PRON- be standard
-PRON- have all -PRON- can eat sushi on the weekday during_lunch for $_12 buck -PRON- think
so that be a good deal
except all the sushi be very basic cheap to make with ton_of rice outside and very tiny sushi filling
yeah -PRON- be try to fool -PRON- in think -PRON- be eat for cheap -PRON- know -PRON-
haha
good way for -PRON- to make money by try to get_rid_of -PRON- leftover
ok -PRON- second_time here -PRON- have outside_seating so -PRON- bring the dog
the service be ok -PRON- be either the kitchen or the sever that be not get the order correct
the coffee be great the fry be amazing and again -PRON- usually never order fry
-PRON- have to send -PRON- sandwich back
and -PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- do
but -PRON- be so hot
-PRON- burn -PRON- tongue really
this only make -PRON- think of a microwave
-PRON- have to say there be so_many restaurant in this great city of las_vegas -PRON- will move on
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have be regular for year and have get to know the staff
great young people many of whom be college student earn money for school
often this be -PRON- first job and the management do a nice job of introduce -PRON- to the real world
the food be good and there be a nice selection include pasterie check_out the hide menu online or by scan the symbol at the store
the service be good occassionaly -PRON- have to be patient with a new trainee
the place be popular and sometimes during rush hour there can be a wait
nice outside eat area
the staff have always be friendly to -PRON-
-PRON- do a horrendous box dye -PRON- want pastel purple
so -PRON- think hey
-PRON- will do -PRON- -PRON-
bad bad idea
-PRON- be splotchy and purple in some place and orange in other
-PRON- go to parlour and point to -PRON- hair and say help
and help -PRON- do
ryan be whiz at lift the colour and then bleach and make -PRON- the purple colour -PRON- have initially desire
-PRON- be super funny and cool and be super_excited to fix -PRON-
and -PRON- happily let -PRON- do -PRON- magic
aimee finish -PRON- off with a maintenance cut on -PRON- short hair
awesome as per usual
-PRON- want to apologize to both for not leave a good tip
if -PRON- have the money -PRON- would
but -PRON- kind_of break the bank this month
so -PRON- figure a stellar review would make up for -PRON-
thank again guy -PRON- would_recommend -PRON- both without a doubt
tornado be a true and unadulterated quality steak- and meat house
-PRON- will not find another in_madison
the first_time -PRON- go here -PRON- be late and -PRON- be very hungry but -PRON- want everything on the menu and could_not decide quickly
-PRON- waitress come_back to -PRON- table several_time before -PRON- could finally settle down on what to order
that day -PRON- have the venison and boy what a great choice
-PRON- be so juicy so tender so fill in the blank with -PRON- favorite word that mean the good thing ever
since then -PRON- have have the privilege of savor tornado 's filet_mignon which just melt_in -PRON- mouth and -PRON- ribeye
-PRON- be a tough judge on ribeye because -PRON- be -PRON- universally favorite cut of steak but
man -PRON- be good here
-PRON- be not big on the appetizer here but the escargot be pretty_good
if -PRON- ever get a chance to dine at this_place again -PRON- have move now -PRON- would want to try the rabbit
final thought
the atmosphere be nice and the service be great as_well
tornado be pricey for sure but -PRON- be worth the mouth orgasm that -PRON- will pay for
trust -PRON- -PRON- do_not stop until -PRON- prey safely and slowly make -PRON- way down -PRON- esophagus and into -PRON- belly
-PRON- will probably end_up cheat on -PRON- favorite restaurant every so often
-PRON- first_time at this sunset grill location this morning be good_than expect
fast service and above_average standard breakfast fare
-PRON- both have the canadian omelet and sausage and -PRON- coffee be refill every ten min a must for any brunch place -PRON- go to
and -PRON- baby be happy in -PRON- own high chair
the bus boy promptly bring -PRON- a new spoon when -PRON- drop -PRON- which make -PRON- just as happy as -PRON- be low on toy
friendly service and inexpensive dependable breakfast item will have -PRON- return
but -PRON- be a bummer that there be not a really good standout brunch place in -PRON- hood
oh_well
dr mullings be by_far the good vet -PRON- have ever have
not only be -PRON- great with -PRON- kitty but -PRON- have an_amazing bedside manner with -PRON-
very gentle treatment take every precaution for -PRON- pet 's comfort no unnecessary jab while consider every risk
after 6 year -PRON- trust -PRON- implicitly
-PRON- have also see one of -PRON- associate who -PRON- also like very much
plus the fee be very_reasonable and -PRON- have evening hour to work with anyone 's schedule
-PRON- be a fan_of arepas so when -PRON- find -PRON- resto
-PRON- be soooooo excited
rating breakdown 4.5_star ambiance decor super cool spot only criticism table for 4 be a_bit tight if -PRON- order lot_of item plus a bottle_of water
5.0 star service be excellent
attentive and prompt
3.5_star -food be salty
-PRON- order arepas w chorizo and flank steak -PRON- just seem overly salty arepa be dry and taste a_bit burned -PRON- guess due_to char marking coleslaw be great and so be the tostadas
lemonade cost 4.50 per glass -PRON- find -PRON- too_sweet
overall a good experience for the most_part but -PRON- will search for another areperia to see_how -PRON- compare
-PRON- partner and -PRON- frequent this_place often
in_term_of pho -PRON- think other place have good broth
but this be the only place where -PRON- have go to and -PRON- sate be delicious
in_term_of the ambience -PRON- be a family restaurant
so -PRON- sometimes have child run_around and scream
if -PRON- want good food -PRON- would still say come_here
-PRON- would_recommend this_place and say try the sate beef noodle_soup
-PRON- think -PRON- be number 117
-PRON- be spicy and have a peanut_butter taste
ich muss sagen ich fand es sehr schön und angenehm in der speisekammer
ein lauer sommerabend den wir draußen mit romantisch außenbestuhlung verbringen konnten wurde durch die sehr nette und äußerst freundliche
chefin mit hervorragendem essen abgerundet
gegessen wurden hi gazpacho gurkenkaltschale forelle sowie teigwaren mit pinienkernen und gemüse
wir können alle nur empfehlen und werden mit sicherheit wieder komman

every hotel have a casual cafe\/resto where -PRON- can roll in for breakfast or grab a sandwich all day long
the henry be not 5_star fine_dining but -PRON- be good and a notch above most casual hotel cafe along the strip
-PRON- quite enjoy that the breakfast menu have everything from berry smoothie to steel cut irish oats to organic yogurt parfait
as_well_as indulgent benedict and omelet croque monsieur omelet

-PRON- probably could have 3 meal out of -PRON-
-PRON- also have really well craft breakfast cocktail like the the mary pickford bloody_mary with sriracha vodka muddle cucumber and dill
-PRON- will say -PRON- have have really great service sit up at the wood above and beyond service

-PRON- get an_additional side of bacon and biscuit and gravy
-PRON- be personally not a fan_of sausage_gravy
so -PRON- do_not love that as much
overall thing be fine and -PRON- leave with a full stomach

homemade ikura be amazing
perfectly seasoned and sup fresh
-PRON- do_not see a single egg that_s deflate
amazing combination with -PRON- sushi rice
-PRON- could eat a huge bowl of ikura and the rice daily
the sushi rice be cook_perfectly and the temperature that be almost perfect to not room temp but how -PRON- should be
body temperature
kogane anago be perfectly_cook with a good amount_of -PRON- secret unagi sauce
not_overly sweet
not overpower the natural sweetness of the eel
-PRON- do_not find saltwater eel anago as -PRON- usually do the freshwater unagi
gyoku
homemade sweet egg brand with -PRON- own logo
not too firm
sweet
thick
flavor remind -PRON- of a chinese steamed egg dessert i use to eat as a kid
hand roll premium fatty tuna hand roll with chop onion serve with a dipping soy_sauce
first_time -PRON- have see a hand roll make this way but from now on -PRON- be totally copy -PRON- style at home

simply amazing
dessert
strawberry mille crepe cake
serve with hot green_tea
perfect combination and end to the meal
not_overly creamy or sweet
green_tea be fresh and hot
all this cost approx
$_100 and some change before tip
this be not a meal to be over stuff but be a meal to indulge in the fine of cuisine and to experience the almost absolute tradition of how sushi be suppose to be serve and eat
service be superb if not a little too_much xd the reason_why i say this be because i feel_like i have someone stand behind -PRON- at all time wait for something to be finish and take away lol but great attention and super_nice
the chef_'s be nice as_well
-PRON- probably know -PRON- have a slight accent
so -PRON- be nice to repeat any of the name
i could_not hear clearly when -PRON- serve the nigiri
highly_recommend
-PRON- honestly hate tim hortons
-PRON- big pet peeve be how -PRON- work the line
if -PRON- be stand in line the employee take -PRON- order while someone be still in front of -PRON-
-PRON- logic be that -PRON- get the next order move before -PRON- reach the counter
however when -PRON- reach the counter -PRON- have to repeat -PRON- order all over again
this may not sound_like a big_deal but there be a huge language barrier between canadians and tim_horton employees so -PRON- end_up have to repeat -PRON- order 6 time
seriously
waunakee be long_overdue for a place like lone girl
-PRON- have be -PRON- go to place since -PRON- open
the owner and staff be by_far some of the nicest\/genuine people -PRON- will meet
-PRON- look_forward_to get -PRON- friday fish fry weekly email to see what the special be
some of -PRON- regular menu favorite be the hush puppies nachos and -PRON- delicious beef stew
if -PRON- like a sweet alcoholic drink then -PRON- recommend the berry mojito
in the restaurant industry sometimes -PRON- may have an_issue with -PRON- order all -PRON- have to do be let the lone girl staff know and -PRON- make -PRON- right if give the opportunity
the roof top be a great place to be on a sunny day or on a semi chilly night with -PRON- fire pit blaze
-PRON- even enjoy a movie on the rooftop this summer
if -PRON- have not catch a basketball baseball or football_game on -PRON- big_screen -PRON- be miss out(they show other sporting event too but these be -PRON- personal_favorite
the lone girl be the good place in_town for birthday or special event gathering
-PRON- have a blast at -PRON- new year 's eve party and can_not wait to ring in 2018 there
thank for an_awesome 2017 lone girl crew -PRON- have really_enjoy hang_out with -PRON- friend or do date_night at the lone girl
this_place have great food but be habitually closed when -PRON- state that -PRON- should be open
to put this in perspective -PRON- have be close 4 out of 7 time -PRON- have try din here during -PRON- post hour
-PRON- know_what -PRON- thinking 3_star be -PRON- crazy
but -PRON- be partial to thai food -PRON- be half thai after all
-PRON- have never have anything off the menu here just go for the lunch buffet
a big yay
to the owner who keep the buffet that the former pink pepper have
-PRON- do_not_care for most asian super buffet that seem to be litter the valley but this be an exception
-PRON- be on a small scale and that be because -PRON- can keep up with the quality instead_of quantity
there be still 2 soup to_choose_from and several stir_fry dish a noodle_dish or two and at_least 3 curry
-PRON- even have the thai custard desert and fruit
-PRON- happen to like the custard,(it a_bit like the thai version_of flan
-PRON- husband do_not_care for -PRON- much
but -PRON- hat all custard
grow_up nothing compare to -PRON- mother_'s thai food
-PRON- even open -PRON- own restaurant in the 80_'s before -PRON- pass away
gather a_few award and good of phoenix plaqu -PRON-
a good analogy would be -PRON- mom_'s meatloaf or lasagna
no one can top that right
the service be friendly here
but if -PRON- like -PRON- little bowl of prik nam bplah"(fish sauce and thai chilie -PRON- need to ask -PRON- server for -PRON- since -PRON- do_not keep -PRON- out for the diner
-PRON- can_not eat soup pat thai fry_rice or most noodle without -PRON-
most thai place be like that anyway -PRON- must ask for -PRON- if -PRON- want the spice
the chili paste be fine but can be overpower
so -PRON- do_not bother
the food at the buffet be just ok for -PRON-
but -PRON- husband enjoy -PRON- and there be plenty_of diner that do
the prik khing(spicy green_bean be a_bit thin and -PRON- need to be kick up a notch
the pat thai be fine
-PRON- be surprised because most place have not be able_to master this dish
-PRON- either come_out to sweet or runny
but here -PRON- be fine
not fabulous but fine
the coconut chicken soup thom kha gai be thick and need more lime juice and fish sauce
the papaya salad som tam be nothing that -PRON- remember som tam to be
-PRON- make -PRON- at home and this be the blandest -PRON- have ever have
where be the sugar fish sauce garlic and thai chili
-PRON- know the restaurant be try to aim to please the local palette but -PRON- do a disservice to the ethnic cuisine of thailand
-PRON- will go_back once in a while when -PRON- be crave variety
the place be clean and the atmosphere be great
-PRON- would like to try this one night when -PRON- can order off the menu
-PRON- have a feeling the food will be tasty be customize to one person instead_of the mass
then -PRON- will edit -PRON- review
-PRON- be worth lunch if -PRON- crave some asian cuisine
for the price of a crappy panda chain restaurant -PRON- can have this buffet and get to try out so_much more
the good nail_tech -PRON- have find
ask for katerina

-PRON- be just look around one day when -PRON- and some other customer be go off on some kid for not be christian -PRON- could tell -PRON- be really uncomfortable
-PRON- be glad -PRON- do_not drag -PRON- into that conversation

this_place make -PRON- want to wear a sunhat and walk_around in khaki explain the life cycle of a cactus ok nothing make -PRON- want to walk_around in khakis but -PRON- help with emphasis
the layout be beautiful the volunteer be friendly and the setting be perfect to showcase desert beauty
come from the midwest 2_year_ago -PRON- do_not realize how lovely succulent be
kermit be not lie -PRON- be not easy be green especially in this hot box -PRON- be more brown and gray
yet the garden set -PRON- up very well and make the desert interesting with program event and ongoing education
-PRON- love how this_place mix nature and social life by host all type_of event music yelp party luminary etc
this be a great place to go when -PRON- have visitor or when -PRON- do_not have much on -PRON- agenda and want to avoid go stir crazy
-PRON- will_admit -PRON- may have impulsively buy a discount dbg membership on groupon more for the idea of go here often but -PRON- be worth -PRON- even for the few_time -PRON- make -PRON- out in a year
-PRON- come_here for the first about a month_ago and i be look for taco and i have to admit there taco be delightful flavorful and not too pricey
but there_s only one downside to this_place there
restaurant smell like straight bathroom like there sewer line be all fuck up from the time i go to open the front_door to the time i leave i swear the whole restaurant stink so bad
i suggest if -PRON- eat_here order to go because i would not want to eat in a place that smell bad
see this facility on the foot network diners drive in and dives and have to say -PRON- do_not meet_up to the show hype hype kill
food be somewhat generic and oily
grant -PRON- be tasty to a certain degree on -PRON- pallet but nothing worth mention afterwards nor be -PRON- worth the drive to get there
-PRON- guess -PRON- hype -PRON- up for failure
place be worth another visit if -PRON- be ever in the neighborhood
delicious meat and a well curat selection of gourmet grocery product and wine
very_helpful knowledgeable and friendly owners\/staff
-PRON- stock up before leave town on an rv trip
the yummy prepared food make cooking during -PRON- trip easy

-PRON- have have -PRON- tuna sandwich salad and a panini of sort all of which have be great
-PRON- also sometimes sell art from local artist -PRON- presume but of questionable talent in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- be a great spot to get a coffee or gelato and walk across to the park
one other thing -PRON- once notice the owner or manager of the place be a_bit short with the staff because -PRON- mess a minor thing in an order
make thing a_bit awkward

-PRON- have strong opinion on nissan joseph be pretty_much a professional and give -PRON- pointer on a car -PRON- be think of get
so that be -PRON- story if -PRON- be go to keep -PRON- nissan -PRON- would have joseph as -PRON- service advisor
well the bar be not the best decorate or the most stylish but -PRON- certainly a keeper
-PRON- have a quiet atmosphere and a hell of a happy_hour
the food be very reasonably_price and taste very good
note
this_location also serve ellis island draft and a certain favorite food item
but that_s a secret
shhhh
-PRON- very like beef noodle_soup from this_place -PRON- very good.sasemi ck be yummy too.not so_much on lo main and fry_rice
-PRON- stay_here when -PRON- go to edc in 2011 and promise -PRON- -PRON- would never come_back
however a friend of mine have reserve a room for the weekend and could_not go
so -PRON- let -PRON- stay in -PRON- room for free
the first_time -PRON- stay_here the room smell literally like s***.
-PRON- call the front_desk and -PRON- send a maid to spray some air freshener around the whole room which do_not work
-PRON- be horrible
the bedding be ugly and the room be dark and dreary
the same with the second_time
there be a odd smell and parking be weird
just spend a little more and stay_at a good hotel
-PRON- have take -PRON- car here for a few_year and kinsey have always be helpful and informative
-PRON- have never be pushy on get unnecessary repair
-PRON- know that -PRON- can go here and pay for what -PRON- need and not what -PRON- do_not
this be a great business to get -PRON- car repair
-PRON- hate to leave bad review but after -PRON- experience at canyon falls -PRON- feel the need to
-PRON- be beyond excited to have -PRON- hair color and new extension put in
almost 1000 dollar later -PRON- leave the salon satisfied
-PRON- wash -PRON- hair and the color seem orange
-PRON- decide to call and -PRON- fix -PRON- no_problem
great
but now there be another issue
since the second day -PRON- leave the salon -PRON- have be loose bead from -PRON- extension and within a month the hair be tangle and feel old
-PRON- know -PRON- be not normal and finally -PRON- have enough
-PRON- be tell to go and talk to mary who be extremely_rude to -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- fault and to either buy new hair or there be nothing -PRON- can do
-PRON- demand to see a manager who once_again point finger at -PRON- but eventually agree for 40 $ -PRON- could deep condition and put -PRON- extension back in with another stylist
to make a long_story_short -PRON- extension be fine now still a little tangly
but -PRON- be funny how -PRON- be -PRON- fault even_though now -PRON- be not loose any bead
-PRON- have never have this many issue at a hair_salon and doubt -PRON- will go_back
at_least -PRON- be willing_to fix the problem but -PRON- feel_like the customer_service and issue be to much to overlook
over a year later and the roof still leak and not a refund wow not good
-PRON- co_worker and -PRON- stop in on the recommendation of other co_worker for taco_tuesday
-PRON- arrive shortly_after noon and there be a line out the door
-PRON- have a debate on stick -PRON- out since -PRON- only have 45_minute but the line appear to move quickly so -PRON- stay
-PRON- mistake
while the line do move fairly_quickly that be about -PRON-
-PRON- both place -PRON- order
-PRON- order 3 carnita taco at $_1.00 apiece on_tuesday -PRON- be a great deal and chip and guacamole
-PRON- both place -PRON- order to go
time on -PRON- receipt be 12:23
ok- -PRON- can do this
-PRON- have a small window now
but -PRON- be doable with a to go order
or so -PRON- think
-PRON- do_not get -PRON- order until 1:11
while -PRON- wait there be plenty_of time to observe
order sit ready to be package to go for many minute while the in restaurant guest receive -PRON- order first
typically someone_who place a to go order be in more of a rush than a dine_in customer yet -PRON- receive priority
talk with other customer -PRON- be discover tuesday 's be normally busy
heck -PRON- even try to call in -PRON- order from the line to speed -PRON- up and -PRON- decline
the gentleman in front of -PRON- leave
-PRON- return later and see -PRON- still wait for food so -PRON- leave again
-PRON- business be lose twice on one day
there must be a good and more efficient way to handle taco_tuesday when -PRON- business be taco
finally 30_min late return from lunch thank_god for an understanding boss -PRON- sit_at -PRON- desk to eat -PRON- taco and chips\/guacamole
the taco be really good
the carnita be tender and have a good flavor
a_bit_more spice then -PRON- be expect but -PRON- be not over power
the onion and cilantro on_top help add to the flavor
very good taco
-PRON- do_not_know about worthy of a 45_min wait from order to receive good
but -PRON- be good
the chip be nice and warm and lightly salt
the guacamole be decent
not spectacular but not horrible
-PRON- would like to return on a day other then tuesday and see if service be quicker and try some other flavor of street taco
there be room for improvement however -PRON- be not completely a disaster
the taco make up for some of -PRON-
can_not go_wrong_with smashburger love love love and so happy -PRON- finally have one in laveen
-PRON- daughter and -PRON- go yesterday during_happy_hour for -PRON- joint birthday linner
-PRON- go mainly to see if -PRON- be as bright and authentic look as the picture show
-PRON- be the most beautiful place to get mexican_food
-PRON- server be name hyatt
-PRON- think and -PRON- be the good
-PRON- be like an energizer bunny and multi task better_than anyone -PRON- have see in a long_time
anyway the service be wonderful atmosphere great and the food very good too
-PRON- be already plan to go again and have tell other about -PRON-
-PRON- normally come through the drive_thru during the day and the service be normally really good
-PRON- be quick and be always greet -PRON- with a smile and make_sure -PRON- have -PRON- order right
one thing -PRON- advertise be the face to face interaction when make -PRON- order
unfortunately most of the time -PRON- go_through with someone or with a big order by the time -PRON- get to the window -PRON- have forget -PRON- order
-PRON- would be nice if there be a small menu of some_sort next to the order window for those of -PRON- who forget -PRON- order
-PRON- go_through the drive_thru last_night and -PRON- take -PRON- forever
-PRON- drive_past the first two window which be understandable since -PRON- be late at night
-PRON- figure maybe -PRON- just do_not have enough people
the cook take -PRON- order
someone_else come to ring -PRON- up and the cook wash -PRON- hand and go towards the back again but -PRON- be like seriously
-PRON- should not be that short staffed
then -PRON- be wait for -PRON- order at the second window and -PRON- look_like -PRON- be either clean out the area or restock since the tea container be in the middle_of the floor
one of the worker be wipe_down the area then go towards the back
when -PRON- leave -PRON- notice there be some cashier\/front worker whatev -PRON- call those guy just stand around eat a slurpee
-PRON- look_at -PRON- look away and then give -PRON- some more of the slurpee look thing and keep on at -PRON-
not work at all
meanwhile the manager come by to refill the cup
why be -PRON- do what -PRON- be suppose to be do
if -PRON- be on break -PRON- be understandable but at_least go out of sight so -PRON- do_not make -PRON- look bad
be not that what break room be for
jordan and moses do an_excellent job move furniture into -PRON- son 's apartment
-PRON- would definitely call skinny wimp move company again
really nice guy
-PRON- wife and i have be look for a place that have great walnut_shrimp and chow mein
-PRON- find this_place in yelp and -PRON- be a success
-PRON- gad the calamari mixed chow mein and walnut_shrimp
and -PRON- be all really good
an add bonus be that -PRON- be super_fast from order to have -PRON- dinner on -PRON- table
-PRON- have a great atmosphere for a date_night
-PRON- will be return often
-PRON- will_definitely_come_back here when in the area
the walleye be awesome the sirloin be also really good accord -PRON- friend
special prop to the bartender jonathon great service
after wander around planet hollywood -PRON- stumble_upon this_place for some quick and dirty food
-PRON- get seat with a wide open restaurant may -PRON- add as_well_as patio between a pole and group_of 6
-PRON- order some burger which be lack luster but do the trick for any hangover
the drink 3.99 blood mary be mehhh
for 3.99 in_vegas -PRON- expect strong but nope
would take about_15 of these to get -PRON- any sort_of feeling
straight spice and tomato juice
regardless the food be just ok but the service be good enough aside_from seating
which earn this_place -PRON- rating
-PRON- have be here a_few time now and -PRON- have always be very happy with the drink and the quality of service
as_well_as have a_few local stewart brewing beer_on_tap there be always a good selection of other craft beers\/cider from across the uk every_time -PRON- have be in
the staff be very_knowledgeable and always make good recommendation depend_on what -PRON- or -PRON- friend have be after
-PRON- be a cosy atmosphere in the place
lot_of local who come from many different country -PRON- should add who appreciate good drink
-PRON- have not try the food yet but -PRON- look good if -PRON- be after good craft_beer this be a place for -PRON-
if -PRON- want the usual drink -PRON- will get everywhere else this_place be not for -PRON-
-PRON- go here today after buy 2 wag jag express certificate for a hot box order and sandwich\/tortilla chip order
so -PRON- save $_4.50
but -PRON- have $_6 special on select sandwiches\/wrap from 3 6pm the same time
the wag jag express voucher be valid so no need for a voucher
everything be very fresh and delicious and what be probably the owner be incredibly friendly tell -PRON- all about -PRON- store and how -PRON- prepare everything include roast the meat -PRON-
nice place and good food a_little_bit overpriced for -PRON- taste probably because -PRON- can_not compete with the mass buy power of subway but -PRON- be a good restaurant to support and a quick 10_minute walk from the financial district
even_though -PRON- live close to the maple leaf gardens -PRON- actually prefer the queens quay location for a real grocery list because the price of some item be double or more at mlg like fresh grated parmesan or fresh salmon organic or not
-PRON- like that this_location have a great selection of organic produce even if most of -PRON- be pc organic brand
this_location have a lot_of take out food option include sandwich sushi and hot food but not as good as mlg but -PRON- usually be here for a restocking of the pantry not lunch or dinner
the one thing that make -PRON- not give this loblaws 5_star be the customer_service desk many of the staff be downright unpleasant
be look for a good place to do an oil_change on this side of town and this_place pop_up
the gentleman quickly come to help -PRON- and the staff be all hard at work
everyone be smile and that be always a plus
if -PRON- be on this side of town -PRON- highly_recommend go here
-PRON- want to like this
the first slightly over a mile be great
good climb view and the drive be short if -PRON- be in the phoenix_area
the end of the hike be pretty steep and -PRON- feel_like -PRON- probably could have do without go all the way to the top
-PRON- opt to go down the other side
and -PRON- feel_like that be not that much good
-PRON- great just be prepare to go a little_slow so that -PRON- can make the whole thing safely
lot_of people be on the trail and -PRON- consistently get stick behind people_who be go at a slow place
also limited parking spot
this be not a loop and so -PRON- will have a three mile walk back to the car if -PRON- choose to now go_back down the way -PRON- come up
enjoy
the food
here be insane good
have seviche and shrimp_taco
everything be insane amazing
the side of corn be to die
and the mango jalapeño marg
-PRON- be in love
-PRON- want to go_back every_day
-PRON- have friend stay_at the wynn and -PRON- be at aria
staff say -PRON- friend could visit -PRON- at the pool
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be not allow in
management include manager sally be extremely
-PRON- mess_up plan for the day for 12 people
horrible business for turn away customer a hour and 10_minute_before -PRON- close
-PRON- be really look_forward_to eat_here
-PRON- will not ever unfortunately
the caramel chew flavor be amazing
cherry on_top do_not have quite as impressive flavor option or top option as yogurtology but -PRON- be a lot closer if -PRON- live in the area
-PRON- find a lot_of the candy bar topping to be too ground down like a powder instead_of small chunk but -PRON- can dig around to find the right size
-PRON- be really impressed and excited that -PRON- have a little paper
divider thing -PRON- can put into -PRON- cup to separate two flavor of fro yo that may not go together
so simple but genius
definitely_recommend this_location for -PRON- frozen_yogurt fix
always on the hunt for a new coffee joint -PRON- stop here the other day for a cup of joe before do some shopping
-PRON- be look for something to eat as_well but only see a lunch menu and special so not_sure if -PRON- offer b fast or not
coffee be fresh and do the trick
-PRON- like the random paper table cloth with crayon -PRON- have on each table so -PRON- can draw out -PRON- feeling and what s on -PRON- mind
do_not worry -PRON- do_not write out where be the freakin breakfast menu
friendly peep get -PRON- peep
cluck
yes no
anywho -PRON- will check this_place out again
-PRON- could_not bear the thought of take -PRON- 17 year_old baby girl to the vet 's office
-PRON- be a place -PRON- definitely be not fond of
-PRON- call and speak with alicia who be kind compassionate and provide lot_of information
dr. fixler and -PRON- assistant arrive at -PRON- home and take the time to answer -PRON- question in great detail
-PRON- handle -PRON- sweet girl with respect care and compassion
-PRON- truly take a special person to help -PRON- love one cross over the rainbow bridge
-PRON- can_not express how thankful -PRON- be to dr. fixler and -PRON- staff for make one of -PRON- most difficult day more bearable
this be -PRON- first_time here even_though -PRON- kid have be here once each with friend
-PRON- be do teppanyaki since the kid love -PRON-
waitress lisa be very_nice and attentive
the place be very slow -PRON- be there at 6:00 on a tuesday
-PRON- order a california_roll and a salmon roll for hh
the roll be tasty but the rice be not sticky enough to hold the roll together
but -PRON- chef for -PRON- dinner be so entertaining
the kid have a blast and the food be delish
-PRON- have some special request and -PRON- definitely adhere to -PRON-
-PRON- only_negative be that most of -PRON- food be quite salty but that be common with this type_of food
-PRON- need to remember to ask -PRON- to chill on the sauce next_time
with that be say the price be reasonable compare to benihana and the food really be delicious
-PRON- would definitely go_back for some more teppanayaki
-PRON- be not the sushi pro at all
excellent food and service
the sonoran crepes be wonderful
a_bit spicy but not too_much
the good biscuit and gravy -PRON- have have in a restaurant albeit a bit_pricey
-PRON- be almost as good as -PRON- make at home and a lot less work
the home fry be nothing_special
pretty_much the same as most place
-PRON- specialty juice be very good but be careful -PRON- add up fast on the bill
-PRON- will_definitely be back when -PRON- be in the area and -PRON- plan to be in the area for about 2 more month
the good thing this_company do be brush -PRON- off
like -PRON- say in this review -PRON- be flexible with -PRON- budget
after be tell to go_somewhere_else -PRON- do
cacti landscape be awesome
of_course -PRON- have to expand -PRON- budget a_little_bit
but -PRON- give -PRON- a great design and do a good job
then -PRON- could ever dream of
look for -PRON- specific review for -PRON- on_yelp which will get 5_star from -PRON-
authentic italian pizzeria who serve a_few 2_3 special a day generally one pasta and one meat dish
the owner be friendly and very entertaining
great place all around
ok update time
sushi -PRON- split be good
miso_soup have an odd taste this visit
-PRON- main_course butaniku be unforgettable a real meh
not_sure what_happen this night
-PRON- waitress be mia most of the night
could_not even find -PRON- to try to get refill desert or -PRON- check
must have be an off night for everyone
so -PRON- know yelp have rule about name drop other place so if -PRON- want to hear_about -PRON- horrible experience at another mazda dealership find -PRON- review of -PRON-
that crappy dealership be on the southwest side of phoenix off the 10
-PRON- be awful
but horne_mazda be an_excellent experience for -PRON-
-PRON- could_not have be happy buy -PRON- car from scott elf at horne_mazda
-PRON- have be put thru the ringer at another place and quickly realize that many of the mazda dealership in_phoenix be all connect
-PRON- have sale guy from all over the place contact -PRON- to sell -PRON- a car after -PRON- get treat very badly at another mazda dealership
so when -PRON- call horne_mazda and get straight_forward answer and no b.s
over the phone -PRON- be a breath of fresh air
-PRON- have read great review on the mazda cx-9 grand touring and since -PRON- be look for a vehicle with a 3rd row that be spacious and comfortable -PRON- be not disappointed when -PRON- test_drive -PRON-
price reasonably and not in super high demand yet
-PRON- will be once people realize what be offer for the price
-PRON- be a pretty_good deal
-PRON- love the car but -PRON- be about to go to another brand after the crap -PRON- have be thru
-PRON- be so_glad -PRON- do_not give up and end_up go to horne_mazda
-PRON- partner drive -PRON- into horne_mazda and tell -PRON- to give -PRON- a chance -PRON- be understandably on edge and scott have to work -PRON- butt off to earn -PRON- trust
-PRON- do
-PRON- guide -PRON- very carefully pay_attention to everything -PRON- be say tiptoe when -PRON- be start to worry and do_not try to give -PRON- any line of b.s
if -PRON- have a question -PRON- very bluntly ask and scott very clearly and accurately answer every question with kindness
scott be honest and straightforward and give -PRON- a great deal
the financing department guy be good too
do_not try to nickel and dime -PRON- with extra at the end
but -PRON- do go in to detail to explain what be cover under warranty and what be not
the difference_between -PRON- first experience and what -PRON- be offer at horne be night and day
-PRON- can_not express enough how easy -PRON- be to buy a car from horne_mazda
rarely do -PRON- find a dealership that be honest and straight_forward
one that -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- need to go home and take a shower afterword
horne_mazda be honest caring straight_forward and make -PRON- trust the car industry again
-PRON- do_not think scott will be leave horne_mazda anytime_soon but if -PRON- do -PRON- will track -PRON- down next_time
-PRON- be ready to buy again
-PRON- love -PRON- new car
and -PRON- be so grateful -PRON- find the guy at horne_mazda
-PRON- have a pedicure and a blow_dry yesterday
pedicure be ok but be very rush massage be extremely short -PRON- would estimate less_than 15 second per leg
-PRON- choose a neon pink colour for polish that be a pretty new bottle
but the end result be very streaky on -PRON- big toe
nail_technician be nice though but be on -PRON- cell_phone the whole time when -PRON- be not with client
-PRON- and 2 other employee sit in the pedi chair get massage because there be no client
-PRON- blow_dry be do by the owner
-PRON- be very_nice and say -PRON- have over 30 year experience
but -PRON- be the bad blow
dry
-PRON- ever have
-PRON- round brush keep get catch in -PRON- long hair and -PRON- have to keep manually unwinding -PRON- cause damage to -PRON- end
-PRON- almost as though -PRON- should have be use a wide round brush or -PRON- do_not use the right product before -PRON- blow_dry
-PRON- take over 1_hour to blow_dry -PRON- hair
-PRON- squirt argan oil 3 time in -PRON- hair to finish -PRON- off
at the end of -PRON- all -PRON- hair be all tangle at the end and look crimped not smooth plus -PRON- be oily as hell
-PRON- have have several blow_dry in -PRON- life and -PRON- never take more_than 45_min and -PRON- end never look this disgusting
what a waste of time and money
-PRON- be very tired yesterday to even notice the botch job -PRON- do
and -PRON- would call to complain
but -PRON- will not ever come_back to this_place
so what s the point
the owner mention that -PRON- have have a slow start with this new businesss
this could be a reason_why
so disappointed -PRON- have high hope for this new spot but will_never go_back
a nice deviation to the typical bento_box and maki lunch this japanese pancake house churn out very_tasty pancake serve with -PRON- choice of meat include shrimp chicken and pork -PRON- personal favourite and top with a tangy barbecue like sauce and mayonnaise
the layout be really neat as -PRON- can see the chef prepare -PRON- food though -PRON- do tend_to get a little warm inside as a result
there be other item on the menu but skip those and try the pancake if -PRON- never have one
if -PRON- have 2 or more people order a_few type to sample the different flavour
-PRON- have never have room for the dessert
but -PRON- look just as tasty
great place to bring -PRON- pet for -PRON- medical care
the staff be courteous
dr dawson be great to work with
-PRON- will give -PRON- two_star for food
but a lot_of the server need retrain
kinda different feel at this ht
server all have attitude that feel_like if -PRON- not spend enough money -PRON- be not worth -PRON- time
bar be the bad
not friendly vibe at all
go to ballantyne
much better
just find out about the providence road health review this_location be rat 10 of the 10 bad health score in_charlotte for the month of july 2017
-PRON- be take back a star explain why -PRON- last order be so screw_up
service be bad when hob be there and service be still bad now that -PRON- be cogburns
-PRON- need to learn from the service -PRON- can get from zipps
just down the road
end_up walk_out again
-PRON- eat_here as some friend be stay_at the parliament house hotel of which this be the hotel 's restaurant
-PRON- have a reasonable menu at reasonable_price but -PRON- be difficult to justify go to eat_here where there be good quality restaurant nearby
if -PRON- be stay in the hotel and have dinner as part of -PRON- deal then -PRON- will not be disapoint as -PRON- decent enough
-PRON- would not find many local actually chos to eat there on a night out though
the food be average and the atmosphere one of a hotel not a stand alone restaurant
the howies restaurant next_door be good
okay
but not great
maybe this be a step up over buca debeppo
but -PRON- be not up to the olive_garden par
service be lack for dinner on a saturday_night
-PRON- be serve bread with no fat
have to ask for evoo and vinegar or butter
the stuff artichoke be stuff with bread crumb and parmesan
-PRON- hate bread crumb
ugh
the lasagna be ok but no veggie just cheese and noodle
no whole grain pasta available
very frustrating
-PRON- will not be back
-PRON- change server on -PRON- in mid stream
too pricey
seem_like a sport_bar setup
decide to try another vietnamese restaurant 's mango shrimp salad with pho and for the price of this there definitely be not enough shrimp or mango
the tamarind sauce taste good
but the shrimp be peel in halfs and scatter sparingly on_top_of a lack of mango slice
-PRON- would get 2_star if not for the super_nice service
evening tennis at the coupe rogers
fun time despite a rain delay and 2nd match cancellation
main stadium be nice small enough that -PRON- suspect most ticket offer a reasonably nice viewing experience
unfortunately food suck relative to most other sport venue -PRON- have attend in north america eat at saq bistro
easy fix eat before or after
buy water and bring a granola bar
if -PRON- could give this_location a bad score -PRON- would
every_time -PRON- family and -PRON- go here something always go_wrong
the employee be terrible
-PRON- do_not listen and screw something up every visit
-PRON- do_not give -PRON- the right blizzard or -PRON- mess_up the sizing
then -PRON- take -PRON- a lifetime to come up with a solution by then -PRON- give up and leave with -PRON- destroy order
save -PRON- sanity and keep -PRON- happiness of have a family treat by go to another location at all cost
this one need to be overhaul from manager down
just do_not go go to the one by green valley high_school or boulder city
great spot
720 have have many iteration over the year but -PRON- seem -PRON- have finally pardon the pun find -PRON- groove
the big attraction be certainly the music
not a huge shop but incredibly well curat stock
if hip_hop soul r&b or local music be what -PRON- be after stop here and -PRON- will_likely find -PRON- lot_of 12"s too
the monthly brunch be worth_check_out too
again not a huge_selection and get early the amount_of food be limit but something unique different and definitely have a strong community vibe go on
-PRON- seem_like the folk at 720 be not afraid to experiment a_bit
there be all sort_of event happen at the store
this kind_of unique spot be hard to come by -PRON- hope -PRON- be around for year to come
do_not get the nachos
the nachos use to be decent but then change to nachos supreme for one
which mean -PRON- take out half the nachos and keep the $_14 price_tag
-PRON- be sorry but if -PRON- be go to serve half the nachos charge half the price
pauper have be a regular spot for -PRON- for year and -PRON- do_not want to give -PRON- a bad review so -PRON- will settle on 3_star because the rest_of -PRON- be fine but come on those nachos be robbery
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go in with intention of dining off the restaurant week menu
not to either of -PRON- surprise
but -PRON- be never offer to -PRON-
-PRON- do_not_mind though because -PRON- be -PRON- first_time there and the menu be just too appeal to limit -PRON- to a prix_fixe menu
everything be out of this_world amazing
-PRON- start at the bar for a couple of cocktail before -PRON- reservation and be not disappoint by the service and craftsmanship of the bartender
-PRON- make -PRON- husband the perfect slightly dirty martini and -PRON- a spot on old_fashioned
once -PRON- sit -PRON- server be incredibly energetic and attentive and suggest many great thing for -PRON- to consider since -PRON- be -PRON- husband 's first_time
-PRON- end_up start with a half_dozen oyster which be fresh and yummy
-PRON- transition to a delicious salad to which -PRON- ask to have the pancetta on the side and -PRON- do_not oblige -PRON- do_not eat pork
but the moment -PRON- realize -PRON- have come_out wrong -PRON- have a correct half order out before -PRON- could even blink an eye
-PRON- indulge in the ribeye for 2 and -PRON- be one of the good friggin piece_of meat -PRON- have have in a while
-PRON- be usually a new_york type_of gal but this ribeye be so flavorful and juicy and do_not_disappoint
-PRON- be usually inclined to order a potato and veggie with -PRON- steak but this time -PRON- order a pasta to accompany -PRON-
and -PRON- be a really great pairing
-PRON- also indulge in 2 dessert -PRON- can_not remember what -PRON- be blame -PRON- on the cocktail and wine
overall this_place be amazing across the board from service to food
one thing that -PRON- will add be that -PRON- make a reservation and -PRON- first try to seat -PRON- across the hall in -PRON- overflow room
-PRON- push back on that as the overflow room lack charm and energy that be suppose to accompany a pricey vegas dinner
love_this_place
anytime -PRON- go here -PRON- super busy but the line move pretty_quickly
make_sure -PRON- know_what -PRON- want because -PRON- move quickly
dr. heeney and staff be helpful and accommodate the few_time -PRON- have need -PRON- service
-PRON- take time to explain thing in a relaxed_atmosphere
-PRON- buy glass which -PRON- be happy with
another time -PRON- have something painfully catch in -PRON- eye after work on home reno and -PRON- squeeze -PRON- in immediately
-PRON- point out that any emergency eye care be fully cover by ohip
so -PRON- be in and out in no time
great selection of frame along_with protective eyewear and goggle
location be perfect too
this_establishment have go down hill
-PRON- be an avid supporter of yoforia
the fact_that almost all of the long_term employee know who -PRON- be just go to show how addicted -PRON- be to this stuff
this_location in particular used to be -PRON- favorite one to go to for -PRON- almost daily fix but since -PRON- last_visit -PRON- will not be return to this particular one anymore
a majority_of the time not all of the machine work which just make this an awful shame not_sure if -PRON- be from the long_term employee quit from lack of support\/respect from the owner\/management
the last tie -PRON- go
-PRON- actually feel a_bit yucky purchase some of the yogurt as_well
-PRON- just do_not feel right:\/ maybe in the long_time future -PRON- will stop_by on a whim and try -PRON- again but -PRON- be talk waaayyyyyyy in the future
cause
-PRON- do_not think this_place be go to be good again anytime_soon
hand_down good la kalbi ever
-PRON- really like the dukbogi too
dale the manager come to say hi and be super_friendly to -PRON-
-PRON- make -PRON- want to go there again
nice environment
the heated floor seating be quite an interesting experience
the brunch be great but the poutine be really not great
have not try other dinner menu_item and will not be after that poutine
*shudder
but the brunch be really really good
this be the absolute worse tsa precheck that -PRON- have ever experience
i frequently fly several_time a month and travel through several different airport everytime -PRON- come thru this airport and -PRON- have pre check -PRON- a bunch_of crap
either -PRON- completely closed and -PRON- have to stand in the regular long_line
and -PRON- get a big e on -PRON- ticket which mean expedite and -PRON- get to keep -PRON- shoe on
whoo hoo big eff deal that be not pre check idiot
that be not what -PRON- pay for when -PRON- register and pay for the pre check privilege
this be not a quick catch a bite place but rather a full evening dining_experience
-PRON- whisk -PRON- off to abruzzo italy for a couple of hour as -PRON- present local delicacy and other delicious offering
since january -PRON- have start provide print menu of -PRON- nightly offering however -PRON- still change daily
-PRON- only book one group per table per night
so -PRON- do_not feel_rush at all
the four of -PRON- go with -PRON- recommend full dining_experience which consist_of 6 course
the first course be the meat and cheese plate which be small but a good sampling of the different option
the next course be -PRON- daily tapas which have something for everyone
-PRON- order two different_type_of pasta which be offer and plat separately
follow the second pasta course be the meat course which be the only course that -PRON- be not_overly fond of but that be because meat be never -PRON- thing
this course be couple with the salad course which have a perfectly mixed salad
-PRON- be not go to order dessert but figure -PRON- be go to go home and have something sweet anyway think -PRON- would go all out and order dessert as_well

oh god this_place be so disgusting
the experience be like eat in the army stand in line while the person behind the counter slap a bunch_of food in -PRON- bowl
-PRON- be nasty
so -PRON- go_back to watch the other customer to see if -PRON- just order the wrong thing
well if -PRON- watch carefully no_matter_what -PRON- order everyone get the same food pile onto -PRON- plate
-PRON- be so disgusted that -PRON- write to the company to say that -PRON- could do good_than pile food in a bowl
the customer_service agent suggest that -PRON- have the server mix the food in -PRON- bowl before give -PRON- to -PRON-
seriously

though the dining_room be buzz and almost full
martini glass be so small
-PRON- almost think -PRON- be a joke

-PRON- be nice and rich with a generous dousing of maple syrup
-PRON- friend say the shrimp and grit be ok but the portion be small
-PRON- also leave somewhat unfulfilled
this_place be great for to if -PRON- want to try something other_than the mundane offering in the city
three and half star imo

seriously that be not an overstatement
but -PRON- be quite good

-PRON- have never be there before last thursday
-PRON- go there on a lunch meeting and be not pay
-PRON- be debate about the fish option but seem plentiful price from $_14 20
when -PRON- lunch partner order soup and a dish so -PRON- go_ahead and order the $_20 jumbo shrimp stuff with crab meat
-PRON- come with mash sweet_potato
-PRON- be an_incredible meal
this be a classy joint
a little high brow for -PRON- for lunch
but -PRON- would love to go_back with -PRON- husband for a a nice night out
this be -PRON- second stay_at the stratosphere
-PRON- first vist be in jan 2011
this visit be from sept 21 25 2012
-PRON- be coincidental that -PRON- stay_here_again as -PRON- friend have a timeshare with a great deal for this hotel
con
what -PRON- do_not like about the stratosphere be that -PRON- always have to speak up or else
-PRON- will get stick with a subpar room
last_time -PRON- pay_$ 20 more a day for an upgrade to a suite -PRON- be indeed sweet
on -PRON- recent_visit there be just so_many thing wrong with -PRON- room -PRON- had to move -PRON- to the select room
the select room be on the 18th floor so -PRON- have a nice view of the city
-PRON- be more modern brightly light and have a safe
even the shower run better and include a moen shower head -PRON- be the little thing lol
-PRON- think -PRON- offer the bad room to customer first instead_of the one on the more newly renovate part of the hotel
-PRON- do_not like that
next even_though housekeeping be available until 5_p.m. -PRON- room be only clean once and a horrible job at that while -PRON- be there
really
molina
as -PRON- be pass to and fro the smoke on the casino floor will take -PRON- down
lol
another thing be -PRON- be further down the strip almost downtown so cab can get pricey
also concern the area around the hotel to -PRON- all of vegas be hood
so -PRON- do_not get the dangerous warning with the area around this hotel
as a woman use common sense and do_not travel alone at night behavior -PRON- should practice anywhere
many of the people_who live in_vegas be on hard time homeless people everywhere
no surprise there
pros
-PRON- will say that the stratosphere have some of the good hotel food -PRON- have enjoy in the good ole us of a.
like really good food with large_portion size
the first_time -PRON- order a lot_of room service as -PRON- be on a romantic getaway lol

-PRON- be also great that -PRON- room key grant -PRON- free admission to the tower
go to the outside observatory for the good view of the city
do_not_waste -PRON- coin on the binocular -PRON- be poor_quality
last_time -PRON- go on one of the ride x treme

the pizza both have a lot_of sauce o. -PRON- when -PRON- finally get out water attention and tell -PRON- -PRON- say

so that be how -PRON- come
-PRON- sauce be the good what would -PRON- like -PRON- to do have remade now
-PRON- tell -PRON- well
-PRON- tell -PRON- twice light sauce
maybe if -PRON- write -PRON- down
-PRON- would remember
-PRON- ask how long -PRON- would be to have -PRON- remake -PRON-
and -PRON- say -PRON- be busy so probably 20_min or more
-PRON- tell -PRON- for get -PRON- because -PRON- have plan -PRON- try take the sauce off with a knife
but -PRON- be make a mess and feel dumb so -PRON- just do_not eat there and leave
-PRON- ask if -PRON- want to take -PRON- with -PRON-

-PRON- have the potato_salad bacon bean and rib with chicken clearly -PRON- be cheat day
the meat be tender flavor and go in 60 second
-PRON- happy ending be the corn bread which -PRON- just have to try to understand
if -PRON- be look for a bbq caterer -PRON- would definitely check -PRON- out
-PRON- just notice -PRON- have a store front as_well which be dangerous since -PRON- love -PRON- some bbq
get -PRON- drink to go because -PRON- serve those fast
-PRON- forget about -PRON- drink
so -PRON- wait total 30_minute for a mocha
lighting be dim and music be loud not really the good study space as some have claim
probably a good place to chat but still a_bit too_loud for a deep conversation
star be for the cleanliness
at_least -PRON- have that go on
cool atmosphere with a great view
love the decor and
the open air feel remind -PRON- of seattle 's pike place market
-PRON- favorite be the chicken pot pie bites and the wrapped dates to die for
go yesterday and enjoy special pricing for sangria and mimosa
love_this_place
-PRON- girlfriend be recommend_this_place from a coworker
-PRON- only get a chicken burrito -PRON- be really good

-PRON- be so professional and -PRON- have excellent skill with the laser
love_this_place

-PRON- have be to several around_town but go to the one on main street and stapley in mesa the most sine -PRON- live close by
several_time a month -PRON- take -PRON- daughter there for breakfast
the staff be always very polite and helpful
-PRON- have a great selection of donut and -PRON- be always make the same_day
nothing like fresh donut in the morning
also -PRON- do_not_skimp_on the frosting which be a big_deal for -PRON- since let face -PRON- -PRON- be not eat donut to help -PRON- figure
-PRON- will not go to dunkin donuts for that reason
make -PRON- delicious and who care_about the sugar
if -PRON- care -PRON- would not be eat donut
only knock be -PRON- do_not_accept amex
-PRON- frequently buy donut for work on the company amex and -PRON- have to purchase -PRON- with -PRON- visa and get reimburse
not the bad thing in the world but a little annoying none the less
give -PRON- a shot if -PRON- like good donut

fox rental be a scam
do_not rent from -PRON- ever
yes -PRON- have cheap price but that be all -PRON- have go for -PRON-
-PRON- rent from -PRON- around new years this year and -PRON- be in_town for a college bowl game

-PRON- have proof that -PRON- do_not do the damage and the damage be there before plus -PRON- have witness -PRON- friend that be with -PRON-
-PRON- be run a scam
if -PRON- get lucky_enough to be target by -PRON- then all -PRON- want be money
go with a national and reputable rental_car agency and save -PRON- some time and money
-PRON- be worth -PRON- in the beginning to pay the extra money for a rental_car at well know rental_car organization which fox rental be not
great place for 5 and 7 year_old
-PRON- do_not want to leave
-PRON- go to vegas alot- wish -PRON- have find this_place sooner
do the groupon for 4 ticket and then purchase 5 more at the bulk price once -PRON- be there

pricey for most service and average service at that
the front_desk reception be just an area for 6 people greet -PRON- like -PRON- be do -PRON- a favour

and that be the reason -PRON- stay in business
not much in the way of competition really

the massage be pretty_good mani\/pedi ok but over price and the facial be average
delicious
everything about this_place be great
this be -PRON- first_time eat at house of pizza and come from two east coasters -PRON- can honestly say this be the close and most delicious thing -PRON- have have to real deal east_coast pizza

-PRON- new_favorite pizza shop
of the many chinese takeaway that be dot around edinburgh this will always be -PRON- first choice
as a vegetarian and a self confess picky_eater
-PRON- believe mayfield village offer the fresh and tasty food
there be a stark difference in the taste of -PRON- food when compare with other chinese 's -PRON- have go to
if -PRON- have friend round for a takeaway -PRON- will always use this one
and -PRON- will always comment_on how nice the food be
-PRON- can_not recommend -PRON- highly_enough

the food -PRON- be delicious
today the food be awful
the service by a bartender again shawn be horrible
-PRON- be obviously stress and not only serve -PRON- badly screw_up the order do_not send -PRON- cold app out with -PRON- husband 's hot app but do_not even provide silverware or napkin for the people next to -PRON-
-PRON- order be wrong -PRON- do_not say anything -PRON- would not have get -PRON- anywhere and the food_runner do_not even seem to know where the food be go and just ask the patron who order chicken satay
if -PRON- be go to come_here recognize that -PRON- be totally hit or miss
-PRON- be almost embarrassed to be write this review because -PRON- should have read the other_review and never use this service in the first place
-PRON- experience with marin door to door be a nightmare
-PRON- be travel from outside the u.s. with a connect flight in miami
-PRON- flight be delay and cause -PRON- to miss -PRON- connection
as_soon_as -PRON- realize -PRON- miss the connection and would have to stay the night in miami -PRON- call the company to cancel -PRON- pickup in sfo
this be 6 + hrs before the schedule pickup so easily within a reasonable timeframe to save the driver an unnecessary trip to the airport
the next_day when -PRON- have a new flight and arrival time -PRON- call the van service to reschedule a pickup
at that time -PRON- find out -PRON- have charge -PRON- for the non pickup the night before and -PRON- would charge -PRON- again for a new pickup
since there be two passenger the total charge would be $_100
ridiculous
-PRON- say no thank
after return home -PRON- try several_time to reach the manager to discuss get a refund for the non trip
the manager gulsen be never avaiable even after -PRON- be tell specific time to call

appetizer be a1 -PRON- have tell so_many people about this lil hidden_gem
if ur look for a cool cozy place to chill with friend this be -PRON- place
walk up to the counter -PRON- be taco_tuesday
girl behind the counter ignore -PRON-
-PRON- do_not say a word
-PRON- wait
-PRON- take an order or to someone pass -PRON- twice not a word
after mess with some paper -PRON- ask for -PRON- order not friendly at all
after -PRON- place the order -PRON- turn to the pass_through and cough
-PRON- do_not cover -PRON- mouth at all and there be two plate of food sit there
the taco be shredded_beef with deep_fry shell
not the bad thing -PRON- ever have
but -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- would consider the food to be very good however not authentic_mexican_food if that be what -PRON- be look for
the staff be very reluctant
-PRON- boyfriend order a michelada and the waitress ask -PRON- if -PRON- want one as_well and what type_of beer -PRON- want in mine -PRON- be 7 month pregnant and not even the age to legally drink
-PRON- do_not card -PRON- boyfriend at all which be surprising
the food come_out fast and the portion be a good size even_though -PRON- menu be really small
at the end -PRON- pay cash and the waitress give -PRON- less change back
-PRON- would come_back for the food but because of the customer_service due_to the waitress -PRON- would not come_back -PRON- could easily find another subpar mexican_restaurant elsewhere
all around a good place good food clean service be decent
have a very home like feeling seem as all other patron be enjoy there time there
the phó be not especially authentic but -PRON- be pretty_good
the service be fine as_well
-PRON- do_not remember -PRON- waiter name
but -PRON- be nice
-PRON- intend on give the place another_chance but phó cao do_not stand out to -PRON-
love_this_place
great healthy food option for someone watch what -PRON- eat
-PRON- always get the 1\/2 chicken 2 side
-PRON- have yet to find a side that -PRON- do_not like
-PRON- have a_few beer to_choose_from along_with wine
-PRON- homemade sauce be amazing
try mix the red and yellow together
-PRON- be a nice hotel the room be good size but not amazing valet be fast -PRON- need a pool for kid or at_least an area form the main pool
bar and restaurant look good casino too -PRON- have a little store inside that_s 24_hour nice decoration
very typical ayce japanese restaurant
from service to quality of food to selection pretty_much at par with other similar restaurant
so do_not expect anything spectacular
food item that -PRON- like today yellow dragon roll actually taste quite nice with mango on_top grill eggplant salmon belly surprisingly well do
a ok raman chicken_wing eel hand roll coconut pudding
not so good udon all the beef dish too chewy sushi chicken teriyaki salmon teriyaki
weekend lunch be $ 17.99
include one drink
-PRON- stay_at the south point hotel and have to catch morning flight to san_francisco so -PRON- have -PRON- breakfast at this_place
-PRON- could say this be about average for a quick breakfast
-PRON- do run some special from midnight to 6 a.m. so if -PRON- like stay late -PRON- may get some good deal
what a huge_disappointment
-PRON- have be wait for this_place to open for month -PRON- usually eat at tokyo lobby but be look_forward_to have a great sushi place closer to the house
the place be busy especially for a monday_night but that be no excuse for -PRON- to take over 30_minute for the first 2 roll of the 3 -PRON- order to arrive
the rice be like glue -PRON- know -PRON- should be sticky but not like this
the fish on the rainbow_roll be ok lack real flavor
the roll be half the diameter of tokyo 's and almost twice the price $_11 vegas roll $_13 rainbow_roll and -PRON- believe the surf and turf be $_17
the 3rd roll -PRON- order do_not arrive for another 15_minute -PRON- be the surf and turf roll this one have great flavor but again the rice suck
-PRON- make the mistake of order one more roll i know stupid but the 2 of -PRON- be still hungry after the first 3 small roll
the vegas roll arrive how could -PRON- screw_up something as simple as that
but -PRON- manage
-PRON- think -PRON- could have do better at a grocery_store with that one
the final and most disturbing thing be the fly
some genius design a sushi bar to have 2 huge garage_door that open so -PRON- can have an open air bar
so let see raw fish+open walls+no fly fan = a very disgusting fly fill din experience
the food get 2_star but overall a 1_star because of what -PRON- be sure can_not be a healthy mix of raw_fish and fly everywhere
what a shame
this_place be just amazing
-PRON- will_never get tired of this_place
every_time -PRON- come_here -PRON- always have to try_something_different off -PRON- menu
-PRON- goal be to try everything on -PRON- menu
-PRON- last_visit
-PRON- try -PRON- happymess truffle_fry top with shave ny strip pico and bleu cheese
bleu cheese be really not -PRON- cup of tea and -PRON- still be not but this dish be still good and would be even awesome if -PRON- like bleu cheese
joanne do a great_job on -PRON- eyebrow but -PRON- assistant do_not put the attention to detail into -PRON- like joanne do
if -PRON- get joanne 5_star
but beware when -PRON- assistant do -PRON- eyebrow no attention to detail and just try to get people in and out
-PRON- have never have -PRON- brow do before where -PRON- do_not also tweeze
-PRON- assistant always just thread and send -PRON- on -PRON- way
within a week -PRON- eyebrow look_like -PRON- need do again
will not be back unless -PRON- know only joanne will be there
-PRON- have be go to nicole for over 3_year and -PRON- always love -PRON- hair
-PRON- do_not have a normal schedule and -PRON- always find time for -PRON- which -PRON- really_appreciate

which -PRON- love because if -PRON- be like -PRON- -PRON- want to get in and out
-PRON- recommend nicole for any of -PRON- hair need

-PRON- will not heistate to use -PRON- service again or recommend -PRON- to other
thank mark
next to juniper junction the raj mahal be -PRON- go to second choice
the place be pretty unclean look though the owner have down some decent renovation over the year to spruce thing up but expect the occasional leaky ceiling and some dirty wall
the buffet be fantastic and the dish be generally very authentic
go to woodys today at a suggestion from a friend_who also go there with -PRON- -PRON- be also not include in any of the food but -PRON- do know some of the people there so -PRON- stay to eat -PRON- crumb when the good food be bring_out
there be popcorn and pretzel at the bar so after order drink -PRON- start to eat some noticed that the regular_customer move -PRON- both down the bar so -PRON- could_not eat any more
talk with woody
and then the regular that use to go to avenue come in
so -PRON- move so -PRON- could sit together
well the bartender bring -PRON- shrimp
taco dip veggie and dip
and be make -PRON- a pizza and more food that be just for -PRON- -PRON- all get to watch -PRON- eat
but no sharing with -PRON- -PRON- both have 3 drink
and -PRON- play the machine find this to be very rude
will not go_back -PRON- ask -PRON- to come for karaoke
but -PRON- do_not_know when -PRON- be and after spend money down there
if -PRON- be not a regular -PRON- feel -PRON- do_not_matter
gabe arrive on time provide quick and fair estimate and do great work
-PRON- will_definitely call -PRON- again if -PRON- need other plumbing work do and would_recommend -PRON- highly
-PRON- want to give this less star -PRON- really do but -PRON- be try to be fair
the hotel -PRON- be decent
-PRON- be in downtown charlotte and -PRON- really be in the center of everything
there be a ton_of restaurant in the area and -PRON- seem_like there be plenty to do
-PRON- be even able_to walk to -PRON- friend 's wedding a couple of block away
-PRON- would be nice if -PRON- would make -PRON- clear to guest how to get in to -PRON- hotel and where to park
-PRON- circle around for a_bit before -PRON- realize that the valet outside could be use for the hotel although -PRON- be not specific to the hotel
-PRON- be for the whole epicentre
the parking_garage be the same way
-PRON- main issue be -PRON- guess -PRON- the noise level
-PRON- have never have a bad_experience in a hotel in -PRON- life
there be club and bar around as -PRON- mention before and one in particular blast -PRON- music so loud that -PRON- could feel the base inside -PRON- room
-PRON- ask the front_desk when -PRON- could expect a little more quiet and be not give much of an answer other_than -PRON- usually change the music after midnight and do_not close until 2
-PRON- mention that customer should really be warn about this and -PRON- say oh this be on -PRON- website
-PRON- look for -PRON-
-PRON- be not an easy warning to find
and the warning make -PRON- sound_like -PRON- would only affect light sleeper and that -PRON- be just a little city noise
no
anyone_who can hear would have issue sleep in a place like this
manhattan do_not sound_like this
even with the sound machine and ear plug the hotel so kindly provide to -PRON- when -PRON- complain -PRON- could hear -PRON-
-PRON- even get louder
-PRON- call again and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not have another room for -PRON- to switch to so -PRON- have to tough -PRON- out
-PRON- have travel throughout the country and to many place abroad and by_far this be the bad hotel experience -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- have be look for an infiniti g37 for a while and cochran infiniti in the north hills give -PRON- the good service over other dealership
mike simmons be very_helpful and knowledgeable in the buying process
-PRON- end_up purchase a low mileage 2013 g37 from -PRON-
-PRON- typically hate the car buying process but the last 2 car -PRON- buy be both from cochran dealer and -PRON- will_definitely visit one of -PRON- dealership first in the future
good dr. -PRON- have ever have

the office be very warm and invite
-PRON- hardly get white coat syndrome when -PRON- come into -PRON- office

most_importantly dr. moss be very educated in -PRON- field while also be very_personable at the same time
-PRON- will always listen and help -PRON- with -PRON- concern and question

-PRON- be a huge_fan_of chicken wings and have explore many place in_toronto for delicious wing and something where -PRON- can get away_from the standard level of spicy bbq_sauce
puck'n wings be the place to go if -PRON- want to explore various wing flavour
there be over 50 selection and the wing have never be dry or stingy with the meat on the bone

-PRON- recommend go with a at_least a_few people
then -PRON- can share a variety_of different flavour
if -PRON- decide to get a soft drink get ready for -PRON- to be the size of movie theatre glass
-PRON- definitely do_not go stingy with -PRON- soft drink that be for sure
also the curly_fry be really tastey with a great side dip
the service be pretty friendly and if -PRON- be into sport -PRON- have -PRON- play on the tv screen throughout the restaurant
also from what -PRON- hear for -PRON- guy out there supposedly the urinal have little hockey net and puck for -PRON- to play with while pee

plus -PRON- be really hard to hear and that be a lot come from a 24-year old
-PRON- take_forever for a server to get to -PRON-
-PRON- be really nice but -PRON- be overwhelmed and so -PRON- see -PRON- few and far inbetween

the only bad thing -PRON- would have to say be the time -PRON- take for -PRON- to make the pizza at_this_location
-PRON- seem to take long than_most other papa johns -PRON- have be to
-PRON- have have only the pizza from this_location so -PRON- can_not comment_on the entire menu but if -PRON- want a good pizza at a fairly competitive price papa johns be a great choice
this be -PRON- favourite sushi restaurant in montreal

the decor be not the good however the quality of fish be very fresh and -PRON- can tell the chef at this restaurant take_pride_in the food -PRON- serve
the miso_soup be the good -PRON- have have in the city so tasty yet so simple
the salad that come with most meal be always fresh and the dressing on the salad make -PRON- crave -PRON- until -PRON- eat -PRON- a next_time
order the black cod -PRON- will be cook to perfection and -PRON- will melt_in -PRON- mouth
when in season order the uni sea urchin
-PRON- be extremely skeptical to try this
but when -PRON- first do -PRON- be hooked
when -PRON- see -PRON- on other restaurant -PRON- always order -PRON- but -PRON- never taste as good as -PRON- do from isakaya
another favourite of mine be the grill squid
when -PRON- crave sushi this be the good -PRON- get

-PRON- love triple aaa discount at payless along_with a free passport photo yearly

poutine be amazing and this_place get creative with the option
-PRON- have the philly cheese steak poutine and -PRON- be awesome
fry -PRON- guess could be a_bit crispier
but
oh_well
-PRON- need to expand to nyc or something because otherwise -PRON- be go to have to move to toronto
kinda of wish -PRON- have beer but -PRON- think that be a canada\/toronto thing
come_here and order everything one by one
tony saccos be always the good place to eat
-PRON- can never go_wrong
the coney island beer be awesome
-PRON- be always a favorite
the napoli pizza be probably one of the good pie go
come_here on a saturday evening at 7 pm valet take the car and be greet inside by the hostess
-PRON- be -PRON- first_time here and be provide a tour of the restaurant which be really nice
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- order the crab_cake to start follow_by filet_mignon 10 oz new_york strip steak lobster mash_potato and the baked alaska for dessert
as for drink a glass of champagne and merlot expect to pay 3_4 time the price for a glass of wine versus elsewhere
crab_cake be nice and hot when arrive be a_bit too_salty in -PRON- opinion
the steak arrive shortly_after and be delicious
hand_down one of the good steak -PRON- have ever have very flavourful and juicy
lobster mash_potato be also really great -PRON- highly_recommend
the portion of the side be fairly large so if -PRON- be come as a group sharing would be great
lastly -PRON- have the baked alaska for dessert
-PRON- be massive and flame brandy be pour over -PRON-
from what -PRON- recall -PRON- be brownie on the bottom almond gelato in the middle and dark_chocolate on the top portion
to summarize great first experience
-PRON- would_recommend if -PRON- be come_here to celebrate something important or special
4.5_star from -PRON-
food be real good
-PRON- cook -PRON- wing when -PRON- order so -PRON- be not sit there allday
-PRON- take -PRON- daughter and -PRON- have the general tso 's chicken and as picky as -PRON- be -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- use to get -PRON- car_wash here for year and year and be always happy -PRON- -PRON- work
-PRON- recently_move down to florence and try a local car_wash -PRON- can check -PRON- other_review to see -PRON- but needless_to_say -PRON- be not a great experience
so -PRON- start make a point of swing back through here when -PRON- be in_town
-PRON- just wax both of -PRON- car and -PRON- still do great work
for a full buff wax and supreme wash -PRON- be about 140 buck so -PRON- be not cheap but the work be great
and -PRON- be not go to do -PRON- -PRON-
so -PRON- would_rather pay to have -PRON- do right
which crime be bad mediocre food serve by super sweet owner
or a yelper that embellish -PRON- experience
-PRON- be super hard to be blunt when -PRON- can see the business try to give effort
however -PRON- sadden -PRON- that the food -PRON- sample leave -PRON- extremely unsatisfied
pro service 5\/5
owner be super sweet helpful menu have a nice variety_of original thai dish also a dash of chinese fusion
price be fair portion_size be slightly above_average on some dish
thai ice_tea be tasty con food 2\/5 pad_thai
although a great heaping portion the egg \/fettuccine noodle substitute instead_of authentic rice_noodle leave the dish extremely dense and dry
the noodle sit in -PRON- belly like a rock and be difficult to digest
the blandness of this dish leave a lot to be desire
2\/5
mongolian beef_hash
the overall dish have a prominent sour possibly lime flavor which catch -PRON- off guard and the portion_size be questionable
the hash portion be a tease the 1 hash_brown that -PRON- can find at costco'a freezer aisle -PRON- love costco but still -PRON- be not not large enough to satisfy the amount_of beef cube and the large chunk of bell pepper and onion underneath
after 3 balanced bite with hash -PRON- be leave pick at the rest_of -PRON- saucy beef and veggie wish there be some_sort_of carb or rice to soak up all the moisture to eat -PRON- with
2\/5
-PRON- be let down by -PRON- first_impression of this spot but -PRON- can see that a lot_of local enjoy the variety and the value so -PRON- will just leave -PRON- at that
to each -PRON- own
-PRON- wife and -PRON- frequent the wwh and -PRON- love -PRON-
the staff be amazing especially brooke james and be extremely knowledgable
the perfect place to meet good people and drink delicious wine at a great price
easily the first stop for any night out
no stars
absolutely terrible
buy flower for deliver for -PRON- anniversary and no delivery no show no communication

-PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- be kind_of iffy at first with the price be $ 30\/person but the prime_rib lobster claws and king_crab alone be worth the price

-PRON- have a mixture_of ice_cream and sherbet and -PRON- try a good variety

-PRON- end_up get a scoop of the brownie ala mode which be vanilla ice_cream with fudge and brownie swirl in and omg
heaven
-PRON- also have sundae and ice_cream sandwich but -PRON- ice_cream be decadent enough

-PRON- will not believe the difference -PRON- will make
anne at spectacle help both -PRON- wife and -PRON- and -PRON- could_not be happy
i be so shocked to see the bad review for this_company
-PRON- have be a customer for 5_year
-PRON- come every_week to clean -PRON- pool like clock work
every wednesday at 8:00 am
juan do a fabulous job
of_course over 5_year -PRON- have need to have repair
-PRON- replace a motor reasonably_price
no_problem sense
a new heater last_year
-PRON- love the new one
heat the pool quick
more_than once -PRON- have have to clear a clog line because of -PRON- palm leaf
if -PRON- get an_extra charge on -PRON- bill -PRON- just a_few extra dollar
even -PRON- neighbor have start use -PRON- as a regular pool cleaning service
-PRON- can_not imagine why the horrible review
-PRON- have have really good service for year
very_disappointed in the way the owner be very money hungry -PRON- attitude towards -PRON- customer be always change not very good customer_service -PRON- sad
the owner give out card for all u can eat after u buy 10 u get
one free
then -PRON- tell u that u can_not combine two card to get the free all u can eat deal say that -PRON- say on the card can_not combine with any_other
offer
-PRON- be the same offer lol -PRON- a free sushi just because u have two card u can_not get the free one that be so stupid and contradict
-PRON- mean after pay for 10 all u can eat to get one free what difference do -PRON- make plus the quilty of the fish be get bad the tuna with garlic
have that white kinda nerve in -PRON- turn -PRON- stomach real sad when people just care on or about the money
instead on how -PRON- treat there customer and the quilty of the food that be how a business go under -PRON- will not be go_back
bye
bye
-PRON- will be go_back to sushi
mon there the good by_far
-PRON- be dissapoint by this_place for several reason
first -PRON- be look for a lunch place after just arrive at -PRON- hotel and the hostess totally ignore -PRON- and continue to talk with each_other even after -PRON- go inside to look_at the bar and then come_back up to -PRON-
needless_to_say -PRON- leave
-PRON- go there again later that day but not by choice
-PRON- be -PRON- cousin 's wedding reception and -PRON- have reserve -PRON- there include open bar
-PRON- be about 20_minute early and -PRON- would not let -PRON- in even 5_minute before 8 even_though -PRON- have already pay for everything and be just look for a place to sit_down
so -PRON- make -PRON- wait until the very last_minute
lastly while the appetizer and drink be ok the main_course unfortunately not
several guest do_not even eat -PRON- and -PRON- only eat -PRON- because -PRON- be so hungry
-PRON- be paella and -PRON- be way_too greasy without_any flavor
so combination of bad service and food do -PRON- no favor
great local vibe gorgeous view
have the tortellini absolutely_delicious
service be wonderful
the gm michael be awesome
-PRON- accommodate -PRON- huge party for a recent celebration and make -PRON- evening one to remember
-PRON- server marco also exceed -PRON- expectation
overall a great experience
arrive the afternoon of 7\/4 at approximately 1:00 p.m.
-PRON- drive right past this initially as -PRON- be sort_of tuck in a corner of a strip_mall just across from best buy
restaurant be about half full and -PRON- wife and -PRON- be seat_immediately
the exterior be nice but the inside be beautiful and comfortable
just the right_amount_of open space with dimmed lighting make for a nice lunch
lots outside dining_option be available as_well
the manager -PRON- presume be very active in the restaurant in personally bring -PRON- food to -PRON- table and in wish -PRON- a good day on -PRON- departure
-PRON- waiter be also very good
-PRON- have the blue cod fish sandwich and fry
-PRON- wife choose the grill_chicken sandwich and a salad
-PRON- also split a bowl of bake potato soup
-PRON- fry have a good texture but -PRON- think -PRON- have an_old oil flavor
-PRON- fish sandwich be good but not great
-PRON- do finish the entire sandwich which be quite large but be not blow_away
to be fair -PRON- be very picky and do_not get many condiment on -PRON- sandwich
the baked_potato soup however be very good
do_not even get -PRON- start on the fresh bread with sweet cream butter
-PRON- be tell that breadsmith in lakewood make this for rosewood grill daily
this bread be the highlight of the meal -PRON- be that good
-PRON- wife 's chicken sandwich be very good but -PRON- do_not_care for the salad
-PRON- also love the baked_potato soup and bread
-PRON- do_not feel very good after eat_here but -PRON- suspect not_sure this be due_to one of two thing 1
-PRON- be think maybe there be bacon grease in the baked_potato soup
-PRON- can be sensitive to pork and so be -PRON- wife
a little bacon in the soup should not have cause a problem so bacon grease in the soup may have be the issue
no_problem with the food
-PRON- think this be just something with -PRON- and -PRON- wife
2 maybe this_establishment use cook oil with tran fat
once_again this be something -PRON- be sensitive to and -PRON- would be more of problem with -PRON- and not the restaurant
so -PRON- would give the food a 3\/5 the service 5\/5 and the atmosphere a 5\/5
-PRON- would definitely give rosewood grill another try
atmosphere be great
worth admission cost for seating sound etc
but parking and traffic be horrible and 13 dollar for a beer
6 dollar for a bag of peanut
way overpriced
paige have be do -PRON- lash from the start
-PRON- could_not recommend -PRON- more
-PRON- be patient knowledgable accommodate and -PRON- set always turn_out great
-PRON- have send -PRON- other client that rave too
-PRON- be in primp tonic hair_salon in santa monica now too where -PRON- have be get -PRON- hair do with christine for 5_year and just love that paige be in such a great salon
great food unique option but kind_of pricy for portion_size
always crowd which be a testament to good food but annoying to find a table
-PRON- come just 20_minute before the closing time
get to try new special pork_belly sushi
not typical sushi that -PRON- would see in the american sushi joint
but -PRON- be a great new dish
well_season and just enough for -PRON- to crave for more
-PRON- have house soup make out of clear noodle salmon sushi hamachi sushi spring_roll and glass of wine
everything be good and fast
could be that -PRON- be come at the end of the shift
-PRON- do_not even try to clear out the table to rush -PRON- out
-PRON- have work in the real japanese run sushi place -PRON- would have to say this_place be very close to authentic as -PRON- can be
the food from the kitchen in the typical japanese be usually take a lot long than sushi because most japanese eat sushi first then kitchen food
which -PRON- understand_why -PRON- be a_bit slow than other asian food
-PRON- be consider -PRON- an asian food snob and this_place have meet -PRON- expectation for sushi will_definitely be back
charming little greek restaurant with great service
come_here for lunch on the wknd and the owner be -PRON- server
order the fix price menu as_well_as a chicken souvlaki and the portion_size be very_generous and everything be well_season
-PRON- have the trio of dip for appetizer tilapia for main and -PRON- could_not decide which dessert to get so the owner\/server give -PRON- a taste of both
the chicken souvlaki be very big to the extent where -PRON- be not able_to just pick -PRON- up and eat -PRON-
have a great time here and would_definitely_recommend this_place to -PRON- family and friend
shake machine not work
and no lid for small cup
do_not -PRON- just open this_place
annoying first_visit
-PRON- be writt as -PRON- sit in the drive_through wait for -PRON- food window be open and -PRON- can hear the manager say goddammit and worker swear
-PRON- rather drive a long way to a classier
rallys -PRON- wait so long for this one to open
and -PRON- be not happy
-PRON- need professional worker
have dinner here tonight and really_enjoy the selection of ingredient the service and the value
-PRON- be able_to select the soup base -PRON- would like -PRON- dipping_sauce and because -PRON- select the seafood option -PRON- get a platter of oyster scallop fish and mussel
-PRON- could order more if -PRON- would like for an_additional $_3 per peice
the atmosphere be a_bit dated compare to the new place but the food and service make up for -PRON-
-PRON- be even surprised that -PRON- air conditioning be cool enough when -PRON- enter which make the dining_experience great
-PRON- have be to other restaurant where -PRON- ventilation be poor and -PRON- make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be din in a sauna
-PRON- lemon tea drink also remind -PRON- of the one in the vitasoy tetra pack and dinner also come with dessert
-PRON- have -PRON- mango sago
all in all a great hot_pot place to check_out
very delicious home style indian_food

tandoori chicken could be more crisp for -PRON- taste
-PRON- will be back

the crew who work the afternoon shift two guy and a girl provide excellent service
when -PRON- mention -PRON- be -PRON- first_time -PRON- seem genuinely excited and proud of the product -PRON- put out
whoever manages\/own this franchise should be proud of the staff he\/she have work there
-PRON- deserve raise
the owner and staff call -PRON- and resolve the situation -PRON- be still out some money from get the tint redone because of a misunderstanding on -PRON- part and mine but john assure -PRON- -PRON- will take_care_of the imperfection on the new set of tint -PRON- do

but -PRON- guess -PRON- be good that limit the intake to one per meal
-PRON- start out with the roti telur
pancake style app with egg onion and pepper serve with an_incredible curry dipping_sauce
there be a_few potato in the curry sauce
like little starch boat float in a delicious stream of malaysian happiness

each bite be perfect as -PRON- be drench with the curry sauce and a little add sriracha
-PRON- save the curry sauce for the rest_of the meal
-PRON- wife have the stir fried okra and belacan sauce

but each bite be intriguing
the veggie be aplenty among the rice and sauce
-PRON- order the char kway teow
malaysian pan fry noodle with red_onion and bean_sprout
-PRON- order -PRON- with chicken
whoa
smoky tender noodle with so_much chicken in each bite
-PRON- would think there would not be any left for anyone_else to order

-PRON- find the chicken korma very bland the curried cauliflower and potato be 90 cauliflower
but -PRON- do_not order -PRON- just observe
the onion bhaji be good once -PRON- ask for the yogurt dip to go with -PRON- -PRON- preference
the naan bread be fresh and tasty
service be good but there be only 2 other table in the restaurant and one of -PRON- be friend of the owner or staff
-PRON- could definitely find good indian_food in the area would not go_back
-PRON- come_here for a walk_in appt the girl at the front_desk be rude and very short with everyone
thankfully -PRON- do_not have to wait too_long
the man that do -PRON- nail be nice and professional
however toward the end -PRON- keep make some comment about how short -PRON- nail be and basically how -PRON- would try -PRON- good but that -PRON- nail would not look very good
-PRON- miss part of -PRON- nail completely and leave part totally colorless
-PRON- spend way_too_much money not to have -PRON- nail at_least totally paint
$ 129 for two pedicure and a manicure
no thank
disappointing start to -PRON- vacation
so -PRON- could_not leave montreal without bagel
a quick browse on_yelp
and -PRON- know where to head
-PRON- hotel be in the downtown area and fairmount be a couple of km away
luckily -PRON- have a car as -PRON- may be a little far for tourist
yes -PRON- be the montreal bagel place -PRON- see on tv
-PRON- could_not help but crane -PRON- neck over the head in from of -PRON- in line to peer into the back where man be make bagel
a massive chunk of dough be slowly be snip and the bit form into bagel and set into a boiling bath
once remove from the water -PRON- be sling on a long plank dust with sesame_seed or seasoning and put into the oven

yes one minute
how long til the all dress come_out of the oven

2 min later -PRON- giggle with three dozen hot fresh bagel to eat on the five hour drive back to toronto
tonne of flavour available
-PRON- particularity enjoy sesame and all dress
western cream_cheese
-PRON- sell three variety and smoke salmon
plus the car smell like bagel for day and -PRON- coworker be all thrilled when -PRON- arrive bear gift

the family bring the bagel to montreal in 1919 and move to the current location in 1949
delicious
a must stop
open 24\/7
intrigue by the exterior and -PRON- love for all hispanic food
-PRON- decide to grab lunch here
what a fun artsy atmosphere inside
-PRON- feel_like -PRON- be back in mexico
the food do_not_disappoint start with the thick house make salsa
-PRON- hate runny salsa
that have mild spice and great roasted tomato\/chipotle flavor to -PRON-
-PRON- get the pozole soup which have great flavor and crisp veggie just a mild spice to clear out the nostril
-PRON- boyfriend have the chicken taco fresh flavor and the tortilla be amazing great consistency
-PRON- have be live in_las_vegas on and off for year and never think about come down to this_place
on_top_of that -PRON- have stay_at the mirage hotel casino countless time
-PRON- decide to check thing out today because on -PRON- most_recent stay -PRON- be award a platinum m life member letter that allow for -PRON- to receive two complimentary pass
admission for this_place will run -PRON- $_22 for adult so needless_to_say -PRON- be exit to save $ 44 lol
the ticket line be fairly short and move pretty fast
-PRON- could_not complain_about that at all
once -PRON- get -PRON- ticket and get inside -PRON- be fairly slow not many guest be here and that end_up be a great thing because an attraction like this
-PRON- just know -PRON- would be stumble all over kid lol
not the case
the dolphin attraction run -PRON- believe every 30_minute
and -PRON- luck out to get to enjoy one of the last show of the day or lack -PRON- of
-PRON- be pretty underwhelmed by the show and the amount_of trick that the dolphin perform
for an_additional -PRON- believe $_25 per_person -PRON- can enjoy the feeding the dolphin experience but do_not quote -PRON-
even that -PRON- just think would not be worth -PRON- unless -PRON- have a child who really love dolphin and would like to touch one
after the show there be a self guide tour -PRON- can do and -PRON- decide to head down a ramp that say -PRON- be an underwater experience with the dolphin
this be good_than that show -PRON- put on to be honest
the dolphin do -PRON- own show and good_than the one the trainer put on for the crowd no lie
-PRON- be smart
move along to the other animal there be a separate entrance for the secret garden where -PRON- can go see the lion tiger cheetah and leopard
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- can opt_for a picture to be take -PRON- politely decline and move along the path to be greet_by two white male lion
pretty_cool
and -PRON- just pace back and forth the entire time
further down be the sleeping leopard up high on a rock who eventually wake_up do a big yawn and back to sleep lol
around the corner -PRON- have a white tiger who be intrigue by the people and keep -PRON- entertain
next to -PRON- be a very pretty cheetah who like the other animal pace back and forth and people_watch -PRON-
-PRON- really wonder_if these animal be super bored and need more space
just make -PRON- think
after the cheetah -PRON- get to see a tiger and end -PRON- self guide tour
not_sure_why -PRON- expect a_little_bit more but -PRON- be an overall okay experience
can_not say -PRON- would be back
but if -PRON- have child -PRON- should be fun
this_place be really good

the food here stand on -PRON- own
the good part the wynn comp -PRON- meal

the first cleaning be good a manager name ben come down with two lady
the lady clean and then ben make_sure the house be clean
-PRON- be nice
the second_time the lady come without ben again do a fair job but not as good as the first_time
then the third_time the lady come_out try to rush through -PRON- house in two hour -PRON- house be thousand square foot
there be no way to lady can clean -PRON- house in two hours.my floor be dirty -PRON- kitchen counter be dirty -PRON- bathroom be not clean thoroughly there be stuff on the toilet seat bathtub -PRON- could see
be not wash out and -PRON- be large piece_of dirt everywhere all over the floor
-PRON- be very_disappointed
and -PRON- would not recommend -PRON- service to anyone
before the lady leave -PRON- house the third_time -PRON- ask -PRON- to check the house before -PRON- could even finished check the house and already pack up -PRON- stuff and start to leave when -PRON- tell -PRON- that the floor be still dirty
-PRON- do_not really do anything about -PRON-
-PRON- just wipe off stuff and -PRON- foray while -PRON- tell -PRON- there be crap all over -PRON- house still and instead_of try to communicate with people that probably barely understand what -PRON- be say -PRON- tell -PRON- to leave
food be great but loud disco\/techno music at 6:00pm be not
-PRON- have hit up quite a_few of the sushi restaurant in the area and while -PRON- have find -PRON- favorite sushi the lake
-PRON- be always up to try new one
-PRON- have get a deal to kobe hero through restaurants.com
and -PRON- finally decide to head out and try -PRON- out last_week
kobe hero have an interesting interior as -PRON- serve both sushi and hibachi
-PRON- tell the host that -PRON- want sushi and -PRON- proceed to walk -PRON- to a hibachi table and instruct -PRON- to join a random family
not for nothing but -PRON- do_not want to be eat sushi while have the hibachi smoke blow in -PRON- face while the chef shoot a bottle_of fake ketchup at -PRON-
-PRON- ask -PRON- if there be somewhere_else -PRON- could eat and the hostess lead -PRON- to another room that contain the sushi bar as_well_as several intimate booth and table
if -PRON- be go for sushi definitely make_sure -PRON- seat -PRON- here as_oppose to the hibachi section
one of the first thing that catch -PRON- eye be the drink menu
the drink be pretty cheap with thing like martini and other cocktail cost only $_5
this be not just the nightly special
this be every night
-PRON- never get cocktail out since beer and wine be generally cheap but with price like this -PRON- treat -PRON-
the missus get a nice flavor martini for a lincoln and not only be -PRON- a pretty big drink but -PRON- be strong as_well
do_not let the price fool -PRON-
-PRON- do_not_skimp_on the booze
for an_appetizer -PRON- order the edamame $ 3.95 tuna tataki $ 9.95 and the wasabi shumai $ 7.95).the edamame be what -PRON- would expect from salt bean pod and be good
the wasabi shumai be a_bit overpower with the wasabi flavor and not the good -PRON- have have
the tuna tataki consist_of some sear tuna slice which be pretty_darn tasty
for the actual sushi -PRON- order the kiwi roll $ 9.50 midori roll $ 9.75 and the east sea roll $ 11.00
-PRON- do_not exactly remember all the feature of each roll so -PRON- can_not give comment_on -PRON- individually
however -PRON- do remember -PRON- be decent but none_of the roll be mind_blow or exceptionally stand out
the sushi and drink price be great which make kobe a tempting visit
however the quality just do_not compare to some of the other sushi joint in the area that may charge a_bit_more but have good original roll that go outside the box
still -PRON- be sure that if -PRON- want a change from -PRON- usual sushi place this be one -PRON- will return to
hi all -PRON- write a pretty detailed review on mexico city 's old yelp page and -PRON- can see some of the old review there
the menu have a lot_of the same item on -PRON-
but -PRON- add a lot more plus change -PRON- style of prepare some of the meal
this_place be the good mexican in the city
-PRON- will take the challenge and go anywhere in the city to try your favorite dish at another spot if -PRON- think this_place be not the good
here be the old mexico city review http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mexico city pittsburgh
exquisite
ok first_off
do_not expect -PRON- bill to be less_than a $ c note per_person
-PRON- know -PRON- be in the right place by the ferrari 's in front
now to the important part
terra be the good fine_dining experience -PRON- can find in thornhill and maybe even in the gta
attention to detail be fantastic and the server be very_professional and courteous
-PRON- all be like that which tell -PRON- the management here be top_notch
go for the ahi_tuna as an app
-PRON- have not find anywhere that come even close
also find the good tea here
jasmine mighty leaf special_occasion go to terra
-PRON- have a last_minute business lunch scramble and -PRON- need food fast for at_least 25 people
what be the universal beloved food that -PRON- be to grab and go no beer be not food
chicken
-PRON- be intend to head over to swiss chalet ack since -PRON- be conveniently close to -PRON-
-PRON- be well know and like by -PRON- work
someone suggest -PRON- try -PRON- absolute favourite place bairrada churrasqueira grill instead for the chicken
-PRON- always love find gem in the neighbourhood
so with a quick call -PRON- order 8 full sized chicken for -PRON-
the restaurant be in a strip plaza like 99 local mississauga restaurant and -PRON- be quite old look from the outside
inside be fill with wood paneling and -PRON- be quite old_school
the scent of oil and grill meat fill the air
-PRON- smell great and -PRON- be think the recommendation be a great choice
ordering be pretty_darn easy over the phone and when -PRON- come to pick_up the meat be ready to go
sadly the staff be not
-PRON- first walk_in and no one greet -PRON-
-PRON- be completely empty
-PRON- try to find someone for a few_minute
finally someone walk_out and ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to be seat
-PRON- say -PRON- want to pick_up -PRON- order and -PRON- go to the kitchen to get -PRON-
-PRON- do_not time -PRON-
but -PRON- swear -PRON- wait at_least another 5_minute
a different person come_out of the kitchen and ask what -PRON- want
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be here for -PRON- pick_up and that someone_else go to get -PRON-
-PRON- say that the meat be already do and -PRON- will get -PRON-
-PRON- go_back to the kitchen to get -PRON- feel_like deja vu right
at this point -PRON- be probably stand in the restaurant for at_least 10_minute for an order that be already do
finally the chicken be bring_out in a large aluminum platter and a large carton of sauce be give to -PRON-
-PRON- must have overfill -PRON- because there be ton_of red oil just leak everywhere onto the platter from the styrofoam carton
-PRON- want to head back quickly as people be wait for food
but -PRON- think the person must have have a memory lapse because -PRON- take -PRON- nearly 3 try to get -PRON- to work the credit_card machine
within a good 15_minute -PRON- be back at the office and opening up the platter
the chicken smell be that great rotisserie smell with a hint_of citrus
how do -PRON- taste
-PRON- be more flavourful than swiss chalet with the citrus marinade or baste -PRON- have on -PRON-
the skin be crispy with a paprika spice on -PRON- so why the 2_star review
chicken be kinda cold -PRON- be really dry and some of the chicken look malnourished maybe -PRON- be from be too dry
-PRON- be definitely on the small size
the sauce -PRON- provide do end_up go everywhere and -PRON- be 35 oil
-PRON- be untouched as most people do_not want to douse -PRON- chicken with -PRON-
-PRON- be a toss up
good taste but overcook and cold with the most confusing service -PRON- have have this month
-PRON- wish -PRON- could say -PRON- would order from -PRON- again but sadly -PRON- can_not
-PRON- friend be get marry next_door at rainbow garden and -PRON- bride be hungry
-PRON- call_ahead to put in an order to make -PRON- easy for -PRON-
-PRON- bride ask if -PRON- could do separate order as -PRON- have to pay separate
-PRON- mean who carry cash on -PRON- anymore
so half way_through the order -PRON- realize -PRON- add something extra
-PRON- try figure_out_what -PRON- need to fix
the guy on the phone literally say oh_my god in irritation over the phone and then put -PRON- bride on hold and then be give to rebecca who be even more rude
-PRON- take the rest_of the order
when -PRON- go to pick -PRON- up even more rudeness happen
-PRON- mess_up the order and -PRON- request an_additional ceaser salad that -PRON- do_not give -PRON- dress for
-PRON- pay in cash for one order and -PRON- have to ask for -PRON- change
-PRON- do_not tip due_to -PRON- rudeness
-PRON- be shocked at how rude rebecca be
-PRON- can_not imagine how -PRON- work in customer_service
holy moly be this good
the husband and -PRON- be excited to try this_location out
-PRON- be locate just inside of harrah 's
-PRON- have to take the elevator up to the second_floor which bring -PRON- directly to the entrance of the restaurant
the dining_area be huge
if -PRON- be seat along the outside by the window -PRON- either face the strip or the quad
make for a good people_watch place
the hostess be so friendly with help -PRON- to -PRON- table
immediately -PRON- be greet_by -PRON- wait dominick
let -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be phenomenal
when -PRON- address -PRON- by mr. and mrs. e the entire evening that get -PRON- extra prop in -PRON- book

-PRON- would not change one thing_about -PRON-
-PRON- also have the cream spinach on the side which compliment the meal delightfully

another day another lunch date
this time the destination be valvona crolla vincaffe on multree walk
-PRON- friend and -PRON- walk_in and as downstairs be busy the waitress advise -PRON- to go upstairs instead
-PRON- be seat promptly and both of -PRON- choose the soup of the day which today happen to be tomato soup
also order a basked of pane casalingo which effectively be a_few slice of white bread and a walnut bread
nice enough
the waitress be very_friendly and tell -PRON- all the daily_special -PRON- have on the menu but -PRON- be soup time for -PRON-
tomato soup be lovely and creamy with a dash of olive_oil and basil on_top
the soup come with more of the white soft bread
-PRON- devour the whole plate in record time
this be a nice place to go for lunch good quality food and friendly wait staff
not go to lie loco cantina be one of the most disappointing restaurant experience -PRON- have have in a very long_time
while the food_runner be lovely helpful woman everything_else from -PRON- waitress to the food to the drink be awful
1
the waitress do_not_know anything about mexican_food
when ask whether the barbacoa be authentic -PRON- reply with -PRON- do_not even know_what that mean
compare to what
2
drink
-PRON- order the happy_hour margaritas and the first round be very weak and taste_like soda water
-PRON- send the drink back and the second round be very different strong but too_sweet and sour
-PRON- get a stomach ache from the strong mixer
3
the food
three of -PRON- order the taco combination plate while one of -PRON- order the shrimp fajita
the shrimp fajita be burn with the onion and pepper almost inedible
the taco be also disappointing the shrimp_taco for_example only come with one shrimp
the waitress say this be typical but -PRON- seem outrageous for a taco to have one shrimp
then insult to injury the rice and bean be severely under season
all in all -PRON- would not recommend this spot to -PRON- arch nemesis much_less bring a friend over
move along there be so_much great food in_vegas do_not_waste -PRON- time at loco cantina
dr. tran be amazing
-PRON- have a wisdom tooth extraction from -PRON- both bottom tooth impact
-PRON- be calm and professional when administer -PRON- numb shot which do_not hurt nearly as much as -PRON- expect
super_fast extraction too -PRON- think -PRON- be go to be at_least 90 min
and -PRON- be in and out of there in under an_hour
-PRON- need some stitch which be do very fast as_well
overall a great experience
so happy -PRON- find this vape shop
-PRON- can definitely say this be go to be -PRON- go to
-PRON- be so close to -PRON- house
first_off -PRON- want to say that roxy be hand_down the good
-PRON- be so sweet and attentive
-PRON- help -PRON- pick out the perfect flavor and educate -PRON- with all the question -PRON- have
-PRON- recommend this shop to everyone
as an avid boater who frequent all the lake in this area -PRON- be a little disappointed with saguaro lake and the tonto national forest folk in_general the reason
trash
yes -PRON- know this be not the lake 's fault but -PRON- do degrade the scenery and overall experience of saguaro lake as a whole
the bad area in -PRON- opinion be the area that be accessable by boat only the bagley flat campground area be particularly nasty
many of the remote cove be litter strew as_well
-PRON- have discuss -PRON- concern with the mesa ranger district of the tonto national forest and -PRON- have even go so_far as to volunteer to help clean up
unfortunately -PRON- be tell that -PRON- could_not go to the remote area with -PRON- boat and clean up a liability issue
anyway -PRON- be a shame that area of the lake be nasty
-PRON- be a big shame that apparently nothing can be do about -PRON-
the restaurant be average parking at the lake can be horrible on the weekend and since -PRON- be one of the close lake in the area -PRON- can be inundate with crazy people
canyon lake be good and roosevelt lake be much good but a_bit of a drive
happy boat
a lovely place
the food be just excellent
the waitress be really kind and give -PRON- a lot_of advice
try -PRON- haggi
the one question -PRON- will ask -PRON- be -PRON- worth a maximum 2_hour wait and the verdict
no
-PRON- definitely over hype
not worth try
do_not do -PRON-
-PRON- can buy something super similar at an asian bakery or like t&t supermarket
-PRON- this fluffy cake that -PRON- taste and -PRON- be kind_of like
i think i taste a hint_of cheesecakeness and then when -PRON- be do the cake -PRON- be so unsatisfied
see -PRON- not sweet and -PRON- so airy -PRON- basically empty calorie
as someone_who love -PRON- sweet for be sweet -PRON- be not satisfy finish a slice of this cake
not_sure what people mean by have a rich flavour almost no flavour man
girl need sweetness
but
on the other_hand -PRON- honey pastry thing be quite delicious madeleine
-PRON- really yummy and taste_like honey
but not worth a wait at all
do_not be fool friend
-PRON- only eat cheese enchilada only now
-PRON- can_not eat the meat since the one that get bust with cat in the freezer so_many year back
sorry morris for all those drunk night of chow down
-PRON- wish -PRON- have the option of give sensi a zero_star review but since that can_not be do
this will be a reflection of a one_star review
pros the ambiance and looks\/feel of the restaurant although this can be completely deceive the naan and dipping_sauce in the beginning of the dinner con the service
-PRON- waiter be completely rude and neglectful
-PRON- order the crispy shrimp appetizer in the beginning to start_off -PRON- meal
no where on the menu do -PRON- mention that this dish would be spicy
no where
the dish come and have four shrimp and on the shrimp be ginger and a slice of pepper
know that -PRON- can_not eat spicy food -PRON- take off the ginger and the pepper
but sure enough -PRON- be spicy
so spicy that -PRON- have to spit out the food
the waiter come_back to ask -PRON- how -PRON- be do
and -PRON- say that -PRON- do_not like the appetizer
and -PRON- be too spicy
the waiter then_proceed to tell -PRON- that -PRON- probably should not have eat the ginger and pepper with -PRON- and that be probably what make -PRON- spicy
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not
and -PRON- look_at -PRON- smirk and take the plate away
-our food
-PRON- order the butter_chicken with rice and -PRON- fiancé order the special of the night
a bone in steak
-PRON- food be bland
and -PRON- do_not even eat 1\/4 of -PRON- while -PRON- fiancé like -PRON- and eat most of -PRON-
and -PRON- take a_few bite of -PRON- -the service again
-PRON- waiter check in on -PRON- once when -PRON- food come_out and disappear the rest_of the evening
the busboy give -PRON- more attention than -PRON- waiter
-PRON- have to ask the busboy for -PRON- check and -PRON- take 20_min later to finally receive -PRON-
the waiter do_not check in to offer -PRON- dessertts
-PRON- be -PRON- fiancé birthday and -PRON- make note of -PRON- when make_reservation
-PRON- could_not even order a dessert for -PRON- birthday dinner
aftermath
-PRON- go to watch o after -PRON- dinner
when -PRON- be leave bellagio -PRON- start to feel ill
-PRON- tell -PRON- fiancé this and -PRON- say that maybe -PRON- will feel good when -PRON- get back to -PRON- room
this do_not happen
infact -PRON- fiancé wake_up at 4am ill as_well
-PRON- be sick for the remainder of the night
-PRON- usually do_not write review but -PRON- be so upset with sensi that -PRON- feel the need to disclose and forewarn other about -PRON- experience
-PRON- will_never go_back to sensi and -PRON- will be follow_up with the food department of nevada
-PRON- have never feel that sick in -PRON- life
and for -PRON- to ruin -PRON- dining_experience and then -PRON- night
wow
spend -PRON- hard_earn money elsewhere
the good good taste front area indoor be nice great patio the guinness chocolate ball a must
the bad
the menu be a single page of basically steak and burger no side include all around 10_15 bux
beer be pricy
service be average
the ugly worth_check_out at_least once(don't confuse -PRON- with the rundown red stone bar down the street yuck
-PRON- find -PRON- in desperate need of food after the pagan pride festival on saturday and in the area to pay a bill
-PRON- will_admit
-PRON- want to go to tacos el gordo but -PRON- be way_too busy and -PRON- be way_too hangry to wait
-PRON- order 1 al pastor taco 1 chorizo taco 1 carne_asada taco 1 shrimp torta
so the food be good
definitely not the good taco -PRON- have have that title still remain with taco y taco
the chorizo be by_far the good taco
-PRON- be normal sized street taco and -PRON- be absolutely pack with meat and topping
the torta be awesome
cover in shrimp
most place will skimp and give -PRON- more salsa or topping than shrimp but this be perfection
the reason for the 3_star instead_of 4 be honestly the fact_that -PRON- upcharge for topping
tacos start at $_3.50 and then -PRON- add 50 cent for each topping cheese crema and avocado
$_4.50 per taco for -PRON- be a little spendy
sorry
-PRON- just be
and -PRON- do_not tell -PRON- about the upcharge
-PRON- just ask what topping -PRON- want and then -PRON- see the extra 50 cent on -PRON- receipt
service be strange
the girl who ring -PRON- up be short with -PRON-
not_overly rude but definitely not friendly either
so while the food be good -PRON- probably will not come_out here again
-PRON- would_rather drive a_bit further to taco y taco and get more for -PRON- money and good flavor
-PRON- travel a lot and go to a lot_of fine restaurant
this be by_far the good celebrity chef restaurant -PRON- have eat at in the past 3_year
the beef cheek pierogis be good and the pork_chop over polenta be one of the tasty and tender -PRON- have ever have
but the star of the meal be the brussel_sprout side the have a wonderful and complex flavor -PRON- need that recipe
expensive but worth -PRON-
$ 160 for 2 with wine
receive a flyer on -PRON- door for this_place
the menu look good and price be fair
-PRON- can pick_up a 1 top large pizza for around $_8 and -PRON- do_not_skimp_on the cheese for that price either
the pepperoni taste good and overall -PRON- be satisfied
delivery area be limit but call to find out if -PRON- deliver to -PRON-
the guy_who take the order and help -PRON- inside be cool
-PRON- be not a huge pizza fan however when -PRON- wife want -PRON- from here -PRON- will not mind
but -PRON- will be interested_in try some wing and sandwich in the future
fantastic bagel
-PRON- have try several bagel shop on this side of town when visit family over the year but this one top -PRON- all
-PRON- visit 3 time in the 5 day -PRON- be in_town
even_though -PRON- come at all hour of the morning -PRON- be never out of any type_of bagel
bagel be crisp on the outside but light on the inside
flavor cream_cheese be also very good
to top -PRON- off the ice_coffee be serve with ice cube make of coffee
-PRON- drink never get be water_down
family have live in_charlotte for 20_year and after -PRON- bring -PRON- these -PRON- have decide this be now -PRON- go to place
-PRON- have be to the california hula 's location and here once before
food and service tonight be great
tara -PRON- server be super_friendly and take great care of -PRON-
-PRON- order app calamari and ceviche and dinner burger jawaiian jerk pork duk luau well as a share dessert yummy key lime pie and coffee
everything but the calamari be delicious
really no_complaint though
the restaurant be not crowd which be too_bad because the whole_experience and -PRON- price\/value be good
definitely will be back and recommend -PRON-
just move into town and find this_place for breakfast
arrive at 9_a.m. the line be go out the door
the service be incredible as everyone be very_friendly and courteous
menu be short and sweet have all the right mix of sweet and savory
try the pick -PRON- up this time but will_definitely try other soon
-PRON- will_definitely be a regular
-PRON- go to roy 's for a special_occasion dinner and start at -PRON- aloha hour
for $_5 each -PRON- get lobster pot sticker 3 beef skewers 3 single bite with kimchee cucumber_salad
-PRON- have the 1988 with grapefruit juice pomegranate and lychee
yum
-PRON- husband have a mai tai and be not_overly thrilled with -PRON-
-PRON- be all yellow and not_overly tasty just pineappley
-PRON- each order a glass of wine to take with -PRON- for dinner $_5 vs. $_15 on the dinner menu get -PRON- there be much_more cost effective
the staff be very_friendly
-PRON- surprisingly get very busy all at once so there be some delay in service but -PRON- be in no rush so
do_not_mind
the seafood be very_tasty
portion be on the small side though
one item in -PRON- seafood sampler be not as -PRON- should have be stuff shrimp arrive empty
the waiter ask the chef about -PRON- and try to convince -PRON- -PRON- be really there but just on the outside which be irritate because -PRON- clearly be not
so the chef give -PRON- a blob of stuffing on the side
a little odd but at_least some effort be make to make -PRON- right
the chocolate souffle be certainly worth the $ 10.50 and 20_minute prep time
the best
if -PRON- want a little tropical getaway -PRON- be a great place to go
expect -PRON- to be a bit_pricey if not do aloha hour and portion_size a little small but the taste be very large and worth -PRON- and -PRON- do make special_occasion special
so -PRON- be change the status of this_place to a 5_star
ya -PRON- have tourist but if -PRON- do -PRON- right -PRON- can avoid tourist look just go early like 9_a.m. on a week day to go shooting and to take test
and -PRON- will avoid line
-PRON- go_back take -PRON- ccw shooting test with bob
may -PRON- remind -PRON- that this be -PRON- 3rd time every shooting scar to death
bob ease -PRON- fear step -PRON- through -PRON-
and -PRON- end_up do great better_than -PRON- think and pass 1st time try a week_later -PRON- purchase -PRON- gun and go and take -PRON- ccw class
-PRON- have read some of the review on the instructor of this class
but -PRON- must_say the husband and wife team that do this be amazing and idol at that
the class keep -PRON- on -PRON- toe easy to follow and understand -PRON- question be answer and -PRON- even get to meet the owner -PRON- of the gun store how often do -PRON- get to meet the owner of a well establish business not often
-PRON- know because -PRON- be one
the test be not hard but
-PRON- -PRON- do half to pay_attention in the class or -PRON- can miss key point to the test
thank -PRON- las_vegas gun store not only be -PRON- satisfied but more aware safe
everywhere -PRON- go now
-PRON- should definitely check this_place out
the portion be really good and the roll be really good
the fish be very fresh and good
the environment be very_nice too
if -PRON- could give this_place no star -PRON- would
this have to be one of the bad nail experience -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- would think what -PRON- lack in talent
-PRON- make up for in customer_service but that be not the case
-PRON- go there to have -PRON- nail do since -PRON- be on -PRON- way home
-PRON- tell -PRON- many_time
-PRON- want the bio gel uv nail and after do a clear coat of that -PRON- proceed to put shellac on -PRON- nail -PRON- ask -PRON- again
and -PRON- say that -PRON- will last longer since there be gel underneath
so -PRON- go with -PRON-
-PRON- get a black and red french manicure with gem on one finger and the grant total be $_60
-PRON- mention to the lady that the last_time -PRON- do gel nail which -PRON- have on at the time do somewhere_else
-PRON- last -PRON- 5 week
and -PRON- say these will last even longer
anyway 2 day_later one nail chip and then another and then by monday the gem have fall_off
-PRON- call -PRON- to complain and that -PRON- want a refund -PRON- say -PRON- do_not do that and that the manager would call -PRON- back
-PRON- do_not
and -PRON- have to call back
and -PRON- ask -PRON- to come_back in to have -PRON- redone
so -PRON- reluctantly agree
-PRON- go_back in on_tuesday to have -PRON- redone and the service -PRON- receive be beyond awful
the lady_who greet -PRON- say that -PRON- be somehow -PRON- fault -PRON- nail have chip and that -PRON- would only do a color and not the french or gem even_though that be what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- ask to speak to a manager and apparently there be never anyone there who be equip to handle any customer issue
anyway -PRON- do an absolutely awful job with -PRON- nail and practically paint -PRON- finger in the process
-PRON- would have be able_to do a good job on -PRON- own at home
the whole time -PRON- be rude and extremely unaccommodating
-PRON- will_never go_back to this_place and -PRON- strongly suggest anyone consider to go here will go elsewhere
-PRON- learn -PRON- lesson and will stick to -PRON- regular nail_salon in the future
-PRON- advice to the owner give -PRON- employee a lesson in customer_service and nail_tech
also maybe be more available to talk to a disgruntled customer
so -PRON- travel for work and -PRON- be stay_at the hilton garden inn down the street
-PRON- get off work pretty late and want to have something to eat along_with a beer or two
-PRON- see some nearby mexican spot
but -PRON- walk by and -PRON- do_not seem very welcome or happen
-PRON- find this spot and think -PRON- would just check -PRON- out
now first appearance can be deceive the place seem kinda seedy and definitely divey
-PRON- can definitely tell that regular be a staple here
-PRON- be crazy hungry and discover -PRON- serve food until 1 be everyday
kinda risky at a lot_of place because kitchen staff usually fall_off in quality around 11 12pm in most place that look_like this
-PRON- order a blt and -PRON- have to say -PRON- be pretty damn good for the time -PRON- order
bacon be crispy and the tomato and lettuce do_not taste old
soooo gooood
definitely hit the spot
super surprised and glad -PRON- wander in to here as -PRON- do_not seem_like there be too_many option in this area around the late time -PRON- show_up
next_time -PRON- be in the area -PRON- will_definitely be back
compliment to the kitchen and bar tender for hold -PRON- down
-PRON- know -PRON- good when -PRON- hear a bar tender mention -PRON- watch bar rescue
always look to improve upon -PRON-
-PRON- be personally a fan_of the show so -PRON- may be bias in that sense
keep up the awesome work
all of the food be mediocre between passable and ok nothing good or tasty -PRON- friend blame this restaurant for make -PRON- sick
-PRON- be okay
-PRON- have be there twice and neither time leave -PRON- all that impress
the taco be eh
the atmosphere be pretty_cool
-PRON- want to like this_place
but -PRON- be just okay
but -PRON- can say that the service be good both time
-PRON- gf bring -PRON- here a month_ago for -PRON- bday
-PRON- have the ice seafood rawbar as the maincourse which be excellent
the ambience be quite nice and the view be decent although something seem to be lack for that luxurious feel
the food be definitely spectacular
the desert i forget the name but -PRON- be some chocolate bar on a cut board be a nice finish to the delicious meal
-PRON- finally find a place for this food that be excellent
staff friendly and service pretty quick
be here a_few time
and -PRON- be always good
great grocery with hard to find product
this be an_old school kinda place
price be reasonable not great but -PRON- worth -PRON- for the quality
-PRON- read the 2 and 1_star review and -PRON- be absurd
everyone here be friendly maybe -PRON- be just not familiar_with italian hospitality
cool location right in the center of the forum shop next to a nice reproduction of the treviso fountain
came here_twice once for happy_hour at the bar and once for dinner
get the fry calamari which be not bad and -PRON- give -PRON- a huge portion
-PRON- husband get a spicy pasta with shrimp that be also ok
bread be yummy
-PRON- both get nicely make cocktail
-PRON- waiter carlos be very_personable and a good waiter
nice atmosphere and good service
fairly americana menu
-PRON- have a spinach salad that be pretty_good with a fairly decent savory dressing
clean and family friendly of a decent size with a well appoint bar and sport view option
-PRON- would say this_place be just fine a safe bet and should be a cherish spot for local
-PRON- have see a lot bad fairfield oh for the only decent dining_option in a small town
-PRON- will be back and try more item to up this rating
-PRON- have no_complaint about the experience -PRON- have here
yes
this be exactly_what -PRON- be hop for
just cheesy enough just beefy enough just greasy enough just awesome enough
get the cheesesteak if -PRON- be not obvious not mind_blow but that be kind_of the goal right
bread wiz steak and onion
exactly_what the doctor order
would definitely eat_here again
this_place be awesome when -PRON- be cooper 's
great whole in the wall
idk about big guy
good place to go for any legal thing -PRON- need the staff be also very_friendly and take_care_of -PRON- always keep -PRON- update and way cheap_than hire a lawyer go see -PRON-
in august -PRON- be walk with -PRON- mom down marquette to one of -PRON- favourite brunch spot maison publique
before -PRON- could see into the full length window beside the bar someone in an apron step out of the window in front of -PRON-
-PRON- wave and begin pick herb from the small garden under a tree grow out of the sidewalk
chef derek dammann come into view behind the bar and greet -PRON- with such warmth
-PRON- be convince -PRON- recognize -PRON- from -PRON- frequent visit
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- mom
the food here be fearlessly rich -PRON- grill -PRON- croque monsieur in maple syrup
-PRON- find most restaurant be too timid with -PRON- hollandaise but maison publique 's smoked salmon benny have a bright lemony flavour
the decor of dark wood and brass trimming create the feeling of dining on an expensive yacht many decade in the past
oh yes
very delicious canoli and dessert
do_not hesitate and grab -PRON- partner and go enjoy
have to ask for bread which do_not arrive until -PRON- be half do with -PRON- meal
red_pepper flake never show_up
-PRON- order cauliflower soup and a tofu on vegetable stir_fry
soup be great
entree be meh
tofu be almost tasteless
there be many good way to use tofu
food take_forever to show_up
bread_pudding be chewy
-PRON- do discount -PRON- bill without -PRON- say anything
thumb_up to the manager
cheap buffet but do_not have a big variety_of food
the food be very good although -PRON- be very americanized
this_place have be around for many_year and if -PRON- be crave cheap food this be one of the good place in the area
-PRON- do think -PRON- need to switch out the food some more sometimes there tend_to be cold food lay around or dish that be finish and be not replace quickly enough specially for lunch
overall -PRON- highly_recommend this restaurant
-PRON- will not let -PRON- down
rien de moin qu'un 5 étoile pour notre sublime soirée aux 400 coup
ça faisait déjà plusieur années que je voulai m'y rendre pour mon anniversaire mai san succès il faut réserver beaucoup d'avance pour 6 8 personne un samedi soir
cette année mon_copain m'y a emmenée en amoureux le jour même de ma fête un mercredi beaucoup plus facile d'avoir une table dan ce contexte
j'avai de très
grande attente enver ce_resto et je n'ai pas été déçue
en arrivant nous_avon été accompagnés
jusqu'à notre jolie table près de_la fenêtre
l'équipe était
au courant que
c'était mon anniversaire alor cette petite attention m'a fait plaisir
nous_avon débuté avec_un apéritif
aperol spritz pour moi et_le capitaine pour mon_copain
les 2 cocktail ont parti la soirée du bon pied
niveau bouffe nous_avon eu beaucoup de difficulté
à faire des choix puisque tout avait l'air bon
et que j'avais lu sur yelp des commentair extrêmement positifs sur chacun
d'eux
tout en regardant le menu j'ai demandé un amuse bouche à_la serveuse
une huître garnie de pomm verte et d'autr ingrédients qui ont fait
de cette bouchée un véritable délice
les gourmand que nous_somme avon finalement opté pour le partage
de 3 entrées la soupe à l'oignon la mousse de foie et_le tartare de veau
la soupe
à l'oignon était tout simplement délicieuse le meilleur plat de_la soirée
ce n' pas une soupe à l'oignon traditionnelle avec_un bouillon des croûton et du fromage
c' plutôt un genre de potage lisse tellement doux et savoureux et à_la fois
mon_copain et moi nous entendon pour dire que c' le must
j'ai aussi beaucoup aimé la mousse de foie servie avec_un pain brioché très intéressant
la portion était généreuse pour une entrée mai jamais trop pour une bonne fourchette comme moi
le tartare de veau était savoureux
et les ingrédients étaient
bien balancés
personnellement je suis moin fervente des tartare de viande rouge mais mon_copain a beaucoup apprécié
au niveau des plat principaux je suis allée avec la joue de porc braisée
la viande était tendre et savoureuse et juste assez caramélisée dan sa sauce
les accompagnement plus frai
et léger venaient balancer
les goûts dan l'assiette
je -PRON- suis régalée
mon_copain a pris le magret de canard
la viande en tant que telle était savoureuse mai le fait qu'elle soit enrobée dan du choux nous a assez surpris pour ne pas être certain que ce soit un mix qui nous plaise réellement
toutefois dan l'ensemble le plat était certainement réussi et nous_avon une fois de plus vidé les assiette
pour accompagner les entrées et les plat nous_avon demandé conseil à_la serveuse qui nous a servi un très bon rouge
en guise de dessert j'ai opté pour rhubarbe accompagné d'un vin dessert suggéré par la serveuse
je n'ai absolument rien
à dire sur l'accord ni sur chacun des élément séparément
je -PRON- suis régalée
mon_copain a pris la tartelette chocolat et café
il a apprécié les saveur mai ne s'attendait pas à une présentation déconstruite comme il a reçu
le dessert en soi n'a aucunement la présentation d'une tartelette mai tous les élément y sont
nous_avon terminé la soirée avec des cafés et la serveuse m'a remis un petit gâteau
à déguster un autre jour chez moi pour mon anniversaire
notre soirée aux 400 coup a été
à_la hauteur de me attent
la nourriture est excellente les ingrédients sont savoureux et de qualité le service est très bon
et l'ambiance
y est très agréable
il nous en a coûté 345 $ tax et pourboire généreux inclus pour 2 cocktail 1 bouteille de vin 1 mise en bouche 3 entrées 2 plat principaux 2 dessert 1 vin dessert 1 cognac et 1 espresso et la soirée le valait largement
je recommande l 400 coup san hésiter et j'y retournerai certainement
great pho
long_wait but -PRON- then that the food be fresh
very easy transaction and excellent service
communication be do through email and take delivery of item at the promise day and time
will_definitely order through -PRON- again
most of the time -PRON- go the food be great
not over cook
just the right_amount_of sauce
-PRON- usually get the emerald chicken and the jerk pork
friendly_staff
clean environment
but the last two time -PRON- go the chicken be dry like -PRON- be sit to long
the pork have very little sause and the rice be old and crunchy
the portion be small
the guy behind the counter be a_bit rude and the lobby be a mess
hope this be not a new trend
-PRON- have be a loyal_customer for year
hope -PRON- guy shape back up
hate to loose one of -PRON- favorite place to eat
-PRON- bf and -PRON- come_here when -PRON- be late or when -PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- want to eat
the food be good as_well_as the service
no_matter_what time of the day -PRON- come_here staff be always friendly
-PRON- be inexpensive and one of the good place to eat when -PRON- be hungover at 3 a.m.
would choose this over the other popular mexican place any day although -PRON- 2nd choice in the chambana area
update -PRON- have never be so sick from eat a couple of bite of anything
diarrhea and vomiting
-PRON- wife be sick as_well
-PRON- be almost instant
that go to show how bad -PRON- food really be
unbelievable
-PRON- be just here and -PRON- sushi have to be the bad -PRON- have ever have
anything with crab in -PRON- no_matter if -PRON- be spicy or not be bad
-PRON- have eat sushi all over the country and never once have have anything this horrid
-PRON- be stand here with leyna and -PRON- be absolutely not accommodate
-PRON- leave nearly everything on the table and get argue_with by this woman
be careful if -PRON- go here
raw_fish be already risky enough but add in old raw_fish and -PRON- be a recipe for disaster
honestly yelper what be -PRON- think when -PRON- rat this_place so high
do -PRON- serve 10 day old fish all the time
always a great experience
to be honest though -PRON- can_not typically afford go anytime except happy_hour
-PRON- wish the menu be just a_little_bit more affordable
but -PRON- do love the saki bomb and the sushi
this_place be almost always pack but that be a sign -PRON- be do something right
service be absolutely terrible
beef panang be very odd the beef be serve separate and be deep_fry repulsive the curry sauce be delicious though
-PRON- will_never go_back
have not be in a about 6 year and -PRON- do_not_know_why
the food and service be a a++++
-PRON- have group_of 8 guy for dinner and everyone be full and satisfied
6 of -PRON- have to take take a to go box for -PRON- leftover
-PRON- order 4 app 2 calamari 2 bacon slice 5 side onion_ring brussels sprout mash_potato lobster mac and cheese and the wild mushroom and everything taste great
the server serve -PRON- all the side and make_sure -PRON- steak be cook to -PRON- preference
-PRON- mention to -PRON- friend that sometimes fine_dining be alittle salty and the waitress overhear -PRON- say that and offer to cook -PRON- another steak
what service
but -PRON- steak be cook_perfectly and taste great
will be in rotation every_time -PRON- come to sin city
thank -PRON- del frisco las_vegas for a memorable dinner
this be a great neighborhood joint non smoking
and delicious fry
-PRON- want wing but less messy
so -PRON- order the wrap with buffalo chicken still messy -PRON- should have order the salad
hub have wing and -PRON- be yummy
incredibly good and friendly service
-PRON- be greet_by chulie the server
-PRON- order the red pork curry to take out
chulie suggest the dish as -PRON- be -PRON- first_time eat_here
-PRON- be offer water while -PRON- wait which be rare and exceed -PRON- expectation for awesome customer_service
the food come_out quick and -PRON- taste delicious
the curry be the right_amount_of spicy and sweet
the vegetable taste super fresh and the meat be tender and soft
-PRON- be a big_fan_of spicy
and -PRON- can handle a lot but this curry definitely push the limit which -PRON- be surprised yet addict
awesome place -PRON- would definitely_come_back
-PRON- visit belk this_past_weekend and be not pleased_with -PRON- experience
first of all -PRON- want to buy -PRON- mother some makeup for -PRON- birthday from the estee lauder counter
both of the saleswoman be busy so -PRON- wait a while and then swing by again
one of the woman finally speak to -PRON- but do_not seem to understand -PRON- question pretty simple- if -PRON- purchase the wrong shade could -PRON- mother exchange -PRON- later for the right shade
-PRON- tell -PRON- find out the color and come_back
next -PRON- stop_by the shoe department
-PRON- be have a good sale and be quite busy
one thing really put -PRON- off-
there be no box of footie hose to be find anywhere
sorry
but -PRON- do_not want to buy a pair of shoe even at a discount if -PRON- do_not feel_comfortable try -PRON- on
footie be offer both for hygienic reason and also so -PRON- can tell if shoe will fit properly when -PRON- be wear hose-
imo -PRON- be not an optional offering for a shoe department
also salesperson be in really short supply consider -PRON- be have this big sale- nobody ever offer to help -PRON- at all
after that -PRON- go to the fine jewelry counter look for a graduation gift for -PRON- future sil
-PRON- be well pleased_with the selection and the price but even_though -PRON- tell the saleswoman that -PRON- be buy a gift -PRON- ring the earrings\/necklace up so that -PRON- do_not get a gift receipt
when -PRON- remind -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be too late and that if -PRON- want to wait -PRON- could have a manager come over void the sale and re ring -PRON- so that -PRON- could have a gift receipt
-PRON- opt to wait the manager come to void the sale and -PRON- start ring -PRON- up again
unfortunately -PRON- do -PRON- wrong again
and -PRON- be still leave with a normal receipt with the price on -PRON- not a gift receipt
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- could either wait for a manager again or -PRON- could use liquid paper to white out the price on -PRON- regular receipt
-PRON- excuse be that -PRON- do_not do a lot_of gift receipt in fine jewelry"-
so what
-PRON- go_back by the estee lauder counter and again the saleswoman be not helpful
so -PRON- burn a few_minute try on blue jean
-PRON- find a pair -PRON- want to buy but unfortunately -PRON- have be put on a 30 off shelf when -PRON- be not actually on sale
so -PRON- skip that too
finally -PRON- meet_up with -PRON- mom and -PRON- visit the estee lauder counter together
surprise surprise-
the saleswoman not only have time for -PRON- but offer -PRON- mini sample of two different color of -PRON- foundation and the promise that if -PRON- pre order one color and decide -PRON- like the other color better -PRON- could swap -PRON- when -PRON- come in to pick -PRON- up
-PRON- be not impressed_with this belk at all
but apparently -PRON- will like -PRON- more if -PRON- appear to be a well to do woman in -PRON- 50 be rather_than a woman in -PRON- 20 be with a kid in tow
boooo
this_place be awesome

drink be strong and the music be pretty_good

j'ai l'impression qu aucune des personn qui ont émis un avis super positif sur_la poule mouillee n ont été vraiment au portugal ou du moin goûté des plat authentique portugais
j y etai aujourd'hui avec ma petite amie portugaise qui a été scandalisée tout comme moi
la seule choose vraiment portugaise dan ce_resto c est la quantité
oui la cuisine portugaise est généreuse
mai mi à part ca rien ne ressemble au frango churrasco du portugal
sauce piri piri trop abondante normalement on ne fait q passer un pinceau avec la sauce
sur_la viande
le poulet
ne nage pas dan une sauce orangeâtre
deuxièmement ce choruriço a très peu de ressemblance avec le vrai chouriço du portugal et pour finir sur ce qui est pourtant généralement le plus simple à réaliser les salade portugais
sont toujour assaisonnés
au plus simple
cad huile
d olive sel et vinaigre de vin et non cette vinaigrette industrielle
à_la soit disant moutarde
en conclusion il y a de_la quantité mai pas de qualité
with all of the other veggie and vegan_option in montreal -PRON- just have a tough time get excited about what be on offer at le commensal
this be essentially a pay by weight buffet\/cafeteria and as such suffer from the freshness issue that -PRON- endemic to the delivery system
le commensal get a lot_of extra love in the star department because of choice
most veg head be frequently subject to a rather frightening level of same ness in available dining_option
the reason that love do_not extend past two_star be that although there be variety quite a_bit of -PRON- taste the same and -PRON- have yet to have experience anything worthy of remember well enough to include in oh let -PRON- say a review
-PRON- be at good a demi vegetarian but -PRON- regularly dine with vegan and be well verse in vegetarian and vegan cooking
there be many vastly superior option in montreal
please check_out -PRON- list of veggie goodness for a good alternative
holy_crap
-PRON- just witness the lady scold a customer use a groupon
the customer say -PRON- have an_appt yesterday and leave a message to change -PRON- but no one answer or call -PRON- back
so lavie would not take -PRON- say that -PRON- be still consider cancel under 48 hour which void -PRON- groupon
then the lady tell the customer how -PRON- no show impede business and make other customer wait
-PRON- would not stop scold the customer and agree with the customer that yes -PRON- should call groupon to get -PRON- money back if -PRON- want
whoa -PRON- will_never come_here again
extremely_friendly service nice sized_portion and delicious food
setting be very pleasant
the falafel be delicious and melt_in -PRON- mouth
the chicken and lamb be tender and flavorful
small boutique with personal service
stylist take -PRON- even_though -PRON- have two other appt come in
-PRON- be very_friendly and personable take the time to socialize while do -PRON- hair
able_to match color -PRON- get at a different salon
-PRON- have curly hair and be very picky with who do -PRON- hair
-PRON- cut -PRON- hair as -PRON- request and give suggestion to fit -PRON- hair type
-PRON- would definitely_come_back again
only downfall be the debit_card machine be not work properly
-PRON- have to go get money from the atm but -PRON- be very accommodate with this
-PRON- have be here a couple of time and always enjoy -PRON- meal
the big selection of pizza be good although -PRON- would have to say that -PRON- be not hot enough for -PRON- liking
the pizza come_out warm on a cold dish which cause -PRON- to get cold after about_10 min
-PRON- have already ask -PRON- to re heat -PRON- pizza but turn_out -PRON- do_not change much
this be the only_negative aspect of the restaurant otherwise -PRON- have always enjoy -PRON- here
come in to try the wing here after hear good thing_about this_place
safe to say -PRON- definately come through
wing be nice and crispy hot
customer_service be good as_well and spot be pretty clean
-PRON- be worth_check_out for -PRON-
-PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- tour
-PRON- think for the most_part -PRON- make -PRON- realize how lucky -PRON- be and how bad -PRON- could be
-PRON- be there this past july during the uk 's heat wave and there be so_many people around but -PRON- walk_in off the street for -PRON- tour
there be only -PRON- husband and -PRON- and four other tourist
and -PRON- do_not even think about
pre booking and only wait about_15_minute
-PRON- guide be pretty_good except -PRON- can_not remember -PRON- name
and -PRON- like that -PRON- be dress in period clothe
watch the screen with all the different character be nice and the ghost story be good if -PRON- into that
-PRON- really_enjoy how -PRON- have different scene in some of the room
and -PRON- really make an impact on -PRON-
-PRON- be definitely_worth -PRON-
and -PRON- enjoy the gift_shop
-PRON- have the kobe burger -PRON- be great
juicy and flavorful
go there with -PRON- daughter at a spur of the moment service be a little_slow at time but -PRON- be a good experience and will return to start try the rest_of the menu
definitely try the zucchini fry -PRON- be delicious
very small_portion
very_limited choice
totally disappointing
and then guess_what
-PRON- be -PRON- husband birthday
and -PRON- tell -PRON- about -PRON-
waitress say -PRON- will make_sure -PRON- will do some thing special
-PRON- bring the dessert menu and -PRON- choose peanut cake
guess_what -PRON- have for -PRON-
an edible happy birthday plaque on_top_of the peanut cake -PRON- have order
and -PRON- think to -PRON- self well may be -PRON- -PRON- policy not to do any thing
but when -PRON- bring the check omg reallyy
the last item on check be b day plate
0.00 $
and the waitress say -PRON- for the edible plaque
-PRON- be wordless
how else will -PRON- spend a romantic date after the movie than to come_here
as a couple
just the two of -PRON- right
yep
haha -PRON- really be a random decision -and $ 23 for two people
there be in total 18 hole all involve lot_of obstacle and turn
very beginner like nothing_fancy like windmill
but very fun on a sunday why isn't -PRON- summer yet but there be sunshine afternoon
some note the golf club be extremely short
glow in the dark
-PRON- white bra under -PRON- non glow off white shirt will shine through if -PRON- be slow the people from early hole will catch_up to -PRON-
-PRON- get a coupon after -PRON- game buy one get one free admin for the next_time
-PRON- only spend one hour here
note on the obstacle those stars on the floor be the bad
-PRON- hit the inner corner and -PRON- ball go_back to where -PRON- start
creativeness on hole
8 or 16
-i
forget
the one where -PRON- start on the top floor and end_up on ground floor
-PRON- ball get stick under the cat 's nose hole 13
overall
yes go
-PRON- family and -PRON- visit this outback location for dinner
the inside be like any_other location and be clean
the hostess be very_friendly and and point out there be self_serve water while -PRON- wait
-PRON- have reservation and be seat a_bit before -PRON- actual time which be nice
-PRON- waitress be a_bit over the top
-PRON- be try way to hard to be friendly and prompt that -PRON- pretty_much be like a fly that would not leave
-PRON- take -PRON- drink order and then as_soon_as -PRON- place -PRON- drink ask what -PRON- want for -PRON- meal
-PRON- kindly say -PRON- need a_few more minute to decide
-PRON- kid -PRON- not -PRON- walk about_10 foot from -PRON- turn_around and ask -PRON- where ready
this be how the whole night go
-PRON- would not stop ask -PRON- if thing where alright if -PRON- need anything and so on
-PRON- mean
yeah
-PRON- nice not to have to want
but there be a limit
but in turn -PRON- never have to ask for any refill on -PRON- drink
now -PRON- meal -PRON- come_out promptly and hot
but the portion have reduce a lot
almost to the point -PRON- would say half the size as -PRON- remember -PRON- be
-PRON- order the chicken_breast and all -PRON- can eat shrimp
the breast be a filet and still look_like -PRON- come off a cornish game hen
as -PRON- look around at everyone 's plate -PRON- be pretty_much the same story
-PRON- know cost of food go up but come on do_not raise the price and cut the size too
i feel_like -PRON- be in a old wendy_'s commercial where be the beef
the all -PRON- can eat shrimp help -PRON- shock over the price but the shrimp be buffet quality at good and a_bit tough
over all -PRON- be an ok dinner
but i will not be run back anytime_soon
-PRON- have be to touch of thai twice_now and order the sweet sour dish with crispy chicken and both time be super impressed
the sauce be really good and the portion be well sized
-PRON- also try the fry_rice with tofu this time and be in absolute heaven
the decor be not too great kind_of just plain and the bathroom be not very impressive but the quality of food and extremely_friendly staff make this a 4_star kind_of place in -PRON- book
-PRON- waiter be incredibly friendly and helpful in make recommendation
-PRON- will_definitely continue to eat_here when -PRON- be look for a thai fix
-PRON- have get three quote for a pool fence and all three be quite similar so price be not a factor in -PRON- rating
the service however be excellent
from the original salesperson to the two fence installer to the person_who answer -PRON- phone all friendly professional helpful not pushy at all
about a month after installation -PRON- notice that -PRON- gate need a slight adjustment
-PRON- send someone out the very next_day and -PRON- fix -PRON- right_away without_any issue\/fees\/etc
-PRON- have have -PRON- fence for just about a year now and have be very_pleased
this_location be -PRON- favourite in_term_of food quality and taste
-PRON- get the shrimp and pan sear haddock naked burrito when -PRON- need something quick but tasty
-PRON- do_not quite find out what the hype be about this_place
that be why -PRON- go there because quite frankly -PRON- do_not like hot_dog -PRON- just want to see if -PRON- be as good as everyone say
-PRON- love the build -PRON- own concept and all of the topping sound great
the hot_dog just do_not taste quite right
-PRON- do_not think there be anything wrong with -PRON- but -PRON- do_not taste right
-PRON- eat all of the topping and leave most of the dog and bun
-PRON- also order tot with pimento mac_cheese on_top
the tot be great
overly greasy but that be how people like -PRON- -PRON- guess
the menu be self explanatory
-PRON- pick which dog -PRON- want all beef or veggie and select unlimited topping which include all kind_of sauce meat egg veggie pickle stuff etc
same with tot or fry -PRON- can top -PRON- with whatever -PRON- want
-PRON- love the extra dipping_sauce
-PRON- have a great beer_selection
-PRON- do_not order a drink but -PRON- have several beer_on_tap too
and a huge bar
-PRON- kind_of a hole_in the wall place but -PRON- be update and have somewhat of a trendy feel to -PRON-
-PRON- do have a small parking_lot across the road and some street parking nearby
the price be right
$_6 for a dog $_3.50 for tots\/frie a couple extra dollar for select topping on each
as thai food in arizona go -PRON- be pretty_good
clean and nice inside friendly_staff
-PRON- go on a saturday evening and -PRON- be not very busy
food be classic thai good sauce everything be serve hot with beautiful presentation
if -PRON- have tell -PRON- a week_ago -PRON- would order and enjoy a $_17 burrito -PRON- would have say -PRON- be nuts
a $_17 burrito
$_17
but the strip have a way of warp -PRON- sense of value and hey the $_17 burrito and a_few beer keep -PRON- from the casino for at_least two hour so that probably save -PRON- money
there be nothing wrong with the food -PRON- -PRON- waitress keep the beer come and -PRON- have the game on
this_place be insane at night but a fine place to hang -PRON- hat for a while during the afternoon if -PRON- can stomach the price
only be here once
food be pretty_good price be good place be pack
-PRON- jerk_chicken be a little too spicy for -PRON- side be good -PRON- will try_something_else next_time
be -PRON- still energized at 6 7 8 am
this be the spot to be
the only_complaint -PRON- have be the fact -PRON- be with someone that have a table have to wait_forever for -PRON- to go verify that
the club be house music dub step in the front and hip_hop in the back
the section be kind_of small but the crowd be good
-PRON- be pretty exclusive so -PRON- will have a lot_of fun inside
-PRON- friend a s
-PRON- rotate between the two room and have sooo much_fun
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- leave until 10 or 11 be can_not remember -PRON- be have too_much fun
the concept be cool make -PRON- own pizza and -PRON- come_out within_minute
add as much topping as -PRON- want and poof
-PRON- have -PRON- own personal pizza
ok
-PRON- be just ok with -PRON- bc
-PRON- have be to -PRON- competitor
and -PRON- think -PRON- would be different from picture on fb which show a line of draft_beer
that be mislead
what kinda get -PRON- pissed be that -PRON- order a house salad and -PRON- ask for onion and the dude behind counter say rudely no -PRON- can_not put onion -PRON- want crouton why the f can u not put onion
-PRON- ask rudely -PRON- state because -PRON- can_not
maybe -PRON- be have a bad day but no need to be like that
anyway so service suck and pizza be decent at good
what -PRON- do enjoy be the plethora of hot_sauce
-PRON- always end -PRON- review with a saying this time -PRON- will pass on the saying
the view be nice but -PRON- would_rather pay the $_12 to just go to the view 60 $ for pasta be kinda harsh
everyone should be warn
absolutely everything at the wynn be triple the cost of every other hotel in_vegas
the bad part about be charge so_much for every little thing be the service and amenity do_not at all justify the huge price_tag
-PRON- be like mr. wynn build this massive hotel and -PRON- go to pay a premium for just step into -PRON-
there be lot_of gorgeous hotel in_vegas that have amazing service do_not_waste -PRON- money at the wynn
to give -PRON- a idea the resort_fee for internet access be normally an_extra $_20 a day at the wynn -PRON- $_20 per day per device for the low end internet access
also a very basic continental breakfast with coffee one small cup of juice and a muffin will cost -PRON- $_60
oh_yeah
and -PRON- bring tap water
the room be ok but date the tv in the bathroom do_not have a clear picture and look_like -PRON- be from the 90 's drape do_not work nor do half the light
-PRON- have stay_at nice hotel for $_75 a night with much good service
the wynn say -PRON- cater to high_end clientele most people be high_end because -PRON- manage -PRON- money wisely and the wynn be not a wise value at all
-PRON- will_never ever stay_here_again
there be many good choice in_vegas to have a very enjoyable stay
définitivement le meilleur restaurant pakistanais\/indien que j'aie jamais visité
tout est frai et vibrant de couleur et de saveur
mes meilleur découverte par ordre de wow le poisson entier le poulet enti et_le lamb karahi
omg
le naan e aussi plein de saveur ainsi que leur sauce
à_la menthe
en accompagnement un bon deal serait de prendre le chicken rice biryani un riz frit aux morceaux de poulet et un lassi superbe smoothie yogourt et mangue
la salle n' pas époustouflante mai la bouffe est tellement bonne et_le service e tellement courtois
à chaque fois que j'y vai tous les serveur sont super que peu importe le décor de_la salle qui est d'ailleur très propre

so to -PRON- surprise -PRON- do come_out wrong
the sandwich be dry and lack any sauce
the fry be not that good -PRON- work in fast_food basically so -PRON- bar for fry be low and -PRON- would describe -PRON- as stale and leave out for too_long
kinda like when -PRON- order burger king fry and forget about -PRON- for a day
-PRON- understand the need for cost efficiency but for much how -PRON- be charge and leave wait for -PRON- meal do good
the poutine be ok
-PRON- would not have be so bother by the detail of the food if -PRON- have not have wait 30_minute
-PRON- get the blonde ale which be at_least good
try a friend 's burger and -PRON- be average
this_place be not too special and -PRON- would_highly_recommend check_out nearby restaurant
-PRON- dog riley be a total disaster of a dog

the staff be extremely knowledgable smart friendly and forthcoming with information
-PRON- tell -PRON- upfront that this be go to be expensive and all the different option

-PRON- be great totally get the hard part out of the way
-PRON- be treat with kindness by people_who obviously love animal
yes -PRON- be expensive about $ 1700 but obviously completely worth -PRON-
so remember when -PRON- say riley be not the smart
yeah well two day after the rattler incident -PRON- eat a bottle_of midol
-PRON- again find -PRON- back in the clinic
most of the staff remember -PRON- and treat -PRON- and -PRON- with the utmost in professionalism and concern

price and food be 5_star worthy but the young dude behind the counter look pissed -PRON- have to stop what -PRON- be do and take -PRON- money
on_top_of that just what do -PRON- want hand -PRON- off and nothing else
go in plan on spend a lot_of money and just get one thing

the dom rose be actually a nice pairing with all of the rich and heavy topping on the burger
the french_dip cheesesteak be very impressive
the au ju serve on the side be so awesome that -PRON- ask for second serve and -PRON- pretty_much just drink the second cup
-PRON- be somewhat pricey but the overall quality of the food and service be well_worth the price this be vegas after all
matthew be awesome
great service
there be a wait because of the promotion
but -PRON- be handle everything very well
also the guy_who greet -PRON-

-PRON- deliver too
-PRON- will_definitely eat_here again
good authentic_mexican_food in this area
after dining at a_few place last_week in_vegas -PRON- be not too impressed_with this_place
the waiter be not on -PRON- game
-PRON- order wine to start
never receive -PRON- until -PRON- ask for -PRON- -PRON- never check on -PRON- and -PRON- sit in front of -PRON- finished dinner plate for 20_min before -PRON- be remove
order the sausage ravioli which be meh ok
the caesar_salad be huge big enough for two
that be really good
order the hazelnut soufflé which be very underdone
-PRON- deflate immediately
for price like that -PRON- expect to at_least be treat much good_than that
-PRON- will not recommend or return
these_guy call -PRON- a southwest grill yet pull all -PRON- store out of az
love have a rachel 's kitchen in the neighborhood
service be top_notch and -PRON- can_not go_wrong_with -PRON- curry_chicken salad or the scramble_egg with tomato basil for those rough morning
-PRON- judge las_vegas buffet by one thing do -PRON- serve prime_rib shrimp and crab
if so the buffet be in the high echelon
and yes the paris buffet serve all of this and more
-PRON- be a lavish display
the service drink napkin clear away plate be a little_slow
the price be a little on the high side but well_worth -PRON-
-PRON- be a decent experience at cafe gitana
-PRON- think the place be probably too packed or something and so the service be not great
there be a lot_of waiting
and -PRON- be not_sure -PRON- be on_top_of service the hookahs
-PRON- be have a great evening so the fun do_not stop and -PRON- enjoy -PRON-
so be from cali -PRON- have a certain expectation of mexican_food
however be where -PRON- be -PRON- set -PRON- expectation accordingly
-PRON- order the dip trio the guacamole be runny and be not so great but other two be pretty_good
-PRON- get a burrito which be decent but -PRON- be not close all the way
so -PRON- make for messy eating but -PRON- power through -PRON-
-PRON- also have the mole now that be excellent minus the fact_that the chicken be not cook in the sauce -PRON- still be good
the 3rd dish be what -PRON- call an enchilada flavor be good but not what -PRON- would consider an enchilada at all
the refri bean -PRON- have to order separate and -PRON- dare say -PRON- come from a can lol
at any rate the staff be nice and -PRON- be a cute place
-PRON- serve -PRON- be purpose
great hotel
the beds\/pillow be very comfortable
the room be mostly quiet
although for the week -PRON- be stay there there be some construction issue cause random noise late at night
very annoying
bathroom be a pretty_good size as be the room
-PRON- stay in two different room during -PRON- stay and bear be equal
the downstairs bar be very_nice and there be also a cappuccino machine at the bar
staff be all very_friendly
-PRON- also use a media room and -PRON- s exactly_what -PRON- need
-PRON- especially enjoy the private club on the 37th floor
easy to use cappuccino machine great selection of tea fruit and cheese
the hotel be very close to a lot_of great restaurant and shopping
-PRON- be able_to easily walk to many place
-PRON- also provide umbrella at the front_desk which -PRON- need a_few time
-PRON- be a regular here because -PRON- be close to home
the food be okay
-PRON- be -PRON- usual bar food but -PRON- try and mix -PRON- up with seasonal menu
-PRON- be often here for football_game and also trivia night
-PRON- be a nice spot to watch a packers or badgers game since there be several big_screen and tvs at nearly every view angle
this_place can be really busy during those time but the waitstaff often do a good job of do -PRON- good to find a seat to accommodate -PRON-
the bar selection leave something to be desire
while -PRON- have a decent selection of beer -PRON- do_not have ginger beer
once -PRON- ask the bartender to make a hot toddy
and -PRON- star at -PRON- blankly
-PRON- ultimately ask for the ingredient and make -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- husband really want indian_food since -PRON- do_not have a place in -PRON- town that serve -PRON- so -PRON- read the review_on_yelp and decide to give taj mahal a try
wow
this_place be amazing
-PRON- be greet_by the owner as -PRON- walk_in
-PRON- be extremely personable and very_welcoming
-PRON- order the chicken tikka marsala and garlic naan
the food be incredibly flavorful with just the right_amount_of spice
after the meal -PRON- husband say this be the good meal -PRON- have have on_vacation so_far
if -PRON- like indian_food -PRON- would_highly_recommend taj mahal
this_place get a complete 180 makeover from the last coffee joint
the food be fabulous and the fresh squeezed orange_juice be to die for
the carmel latte with a dust of cinnamon on_top be a must_try
the fresh squeezed orange_juice perfect
-PRON- be very smooth sweet but not too_sweet
decide to try this_place out and compare -PRON- to one of -PRON- favorite rita 's
walk_in and could_not believe how big the place be
wow
what be the rent around here
just like rita 's -PRON- offer italian ice and custard\/ice combo
the flavor vary from day to day just like rita be too
here be where -PRON- differ though
check_out those price
yikes
easily $_1 more for everything here
-PRON- guess -PRON- have to pay for all that space somehow
-PRON- have a small ice\/custard and -PRON- be $_6
-PRON- recommendation for the owner would be to downsize the building so -PRON- can afford to compete with rita 's
-PRON- have get -PRON- business model figure_out perfectly which be why -PRON- be pop_up everywhere these day
horrible bbt
-PRON- taste extemely water_down
get the buy one get one free special
4.99 $ for small and 5.99 for large
the small be around the size of the grande in starbuck
the large look to be a venti size
all in all would not go_back again since the drink taste_like crap
water_down barely_any flavour bad then when -PRON- let -PRON- bbt sit in the fridge overnight and all the ice have melt
-PRON- do_not order any bubble so have no comment_on that
-PRON- do however have magazine and a couple card game uno monopoly deal sorry and life
-PRON- go around 3 ish on sunday and there be a_few ppl there
environment be nth special just table two set of booth
and i think a set of single couch
this be a do_not recommend place for drink
but maybe there be hope in -PRON- food and dessert
-PRON- love -PRON- when there be not a line
-PRON- be lucky today drive up and be service right_away
this_location be painfully slow regardless of what be order how_much be order or what time -PRON- arrive
-PRON- have be in there while -PRON- be empty and still have a long_wait for green_tea and a water
inside do_not appear to be well keep either
the table always have trash on -PRON- or be sticky
the bathroom be usually dirty as_well
try this_place out the other day
and -PRON- be a big_fan
not huge inside so the seat probably fill_up quickly
-PRON- go around 6 on a thursday evening and have to wait a_bit to sit_down but there appear to be stand room table to eat at as_well
those may be really popular around 1_a.m. if -PRON- be open that late
cool vibe inside
beers and margaritas available but not a huge_selection
but that be ok
this be not really a drinking joint by design -PRON- would say
think food truck without the truck
and -PRON- say that in the most positive way
start with some standard chip and salsa
chips be good as be the basic pico salsa
nice and fresh
-PRON- table order up some taco chronic shrimp shroomin chorizo+beef and steak
kids enjoy the chorizo and steak taco and ask for more so the sausage must not have be too spicy
-PRON- have the shrimp and shroomin
shrimp be great
the sauce -PRON- be sauteed in be delish and the topping seem really fresh and tasty
-PRON- like the shroomin as_well but be less impressed
do_not get -PRON- wrong -PRON- be good but -PRON- could have use something besides just the standard sauteed white cap shroom
-PRON- guess -PRON- think when a dish center around the shroom throw some variety in there
just -PRON- 2¢.
the staff keep -PRON- variety_of mexi beer come in a timely_manner even with the busy room
pay_attention when order as there be a lot_of option but many have a little upcharge
not a big_deal but -PRON- will add up if -PRON- order lot_of yellowfin taco for_example
-PRON- be not surprise by the bill though
overall -PRON- love the joint
-PRON- be like have a great food truck permanently in downtown willoughby and serve some delish casual food in a style that -PRON- think dtw lack
-PRON- will be back
this be -PRON- regular shop
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend -PRON- to anyone
-PRON- love that -PRON- take_care_of everything there
-PRON- always get friendly fast and affordable service
these_guy be great
-PRON- add some pic because -PRON- think bullshooter expand since -PRON- initially open and -PRON- now look_like a killer pool hall straight out of a movie
although from the front -PRON- look really small
but -PRON- walk_in and see -PRON- extend way back with dozen of pool_table
bullshooter should get five_star because -PRON- have never see -PRON- close early
-PRON- have a decent selection of draft_beer and of_course pbr in can or bottle
there be drink special every_day plus happy_hour in the afternoon and reverse happy_hour 4 or 5 day of the week
plus random special like when the dbacks play and stuff like that
3 buck should get -PRON- some kind_of beer and enough leave over for tip
not_sure what the food be like but this be one of the good bar if not the good bar on 35th ave
and easily the good pool hall in north\/northwest phoenix
-PRON- have be to vegas afew time at the paris hotel the golden nuget

peepshow be an ok show
-PRON- would not have spend full price on a ticket which -PRON- do_not

-PRON- think the tub o milk be use in a very smart way
holly madison 's part be a joke
-PRON- barely be in the show which be fine by -PRON- since -PRON- be never much of a fan
however -PRON- will give -PRON- credit for be able_to get on stage and bare -PRON- all when all the other girl have amazing dancer body

-PRON- be not exactly the most consistent but still a decent option if -PRON- want a filling inexpensive meal
a little hole_in the wall that be a diamond in the rough
last_night -PRON- have a chicken burrito beef burrito and beef tostada with a drink for under_$ 20
the service be quick the staff be friendly and a little sarcastic and everything -PRON- eat could_not have be good

-PRON- dear mother have be see at the tenaya clinic for general care

the day before surgery -PRON- be tell that there be a heart irregularity
in the day lead up to the schedule surgery -PRON- have have literally dozen of test
but apparently -PRON- either never perform a stress test or an eeg prior to the surgery date
-PRON- go with -PRON- to one appointment with dr. ang who wonder_if -PRON- mom could touch -PRON- toe
and -PRON- barely discuss the horrific rash -PRON- mother get as the result of the contrast dye when -PRON- have a ct scan
finally -PRON- get around to discuss the 14 cm tumor and a referral for surgery
since then -PRON- mother have have nothing but the run_around have -PRON- jump hoop after hoop
caremore be a scam on old americans
-PRON- bank on senior die rather_than give -PRON- appropriate timely care
-PRON- be surprised by all of the negative_review
-PRON- feed -PRON- cat a raw food diet and this be the only place in_charlotte that sell the food that -PRON- like not to mention that -PRON- be a_few dollar less_than every other place -PRON- have check_out
trust -PRON- -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- have be to -PRON- all
in_addition this store have a great selection of natural and holistic supplement for cat which be really hard to find
when -PRON- cat taz be sick -PRON- husband and -PRON- spend unspeakable amount_of money at the vet to try to get -PRON- good
in the end -PRON- be the advice of this store and 3 holistic supplement that bring -PRON- back to health
-PRON- have never experience the attitude that other have either in person or over the phone
everyone here have be nothing but helpful with question and willing_to special order product -PRON- do_not normally carry in stock
-PRON- would_recommend check -PRON- out
-PRON- drive an_hour round trip to go here
new recline leather seat be comfy and great for date_night
much good_than the previous seat
-PRON- have be go to serena the owner and aesthetician of zio for about_10 year
-PRON- always leave feeling refresh and relaxed in_addition to -PRON- skin feel amazing
serena be an a experienced professional that can evaluate -PRON- skin need and recommend the appropriate treatment

-PRON- have a hibachi grill where -PRON- make -PRON- own dish
tasty
great service
good food entertainment
-PRON- eat_here a couple time a month love the salmon cream brûlée
probably the bad_experience at a hotel in_vegas -PRON- have ever have
all of the construction be completely annoying but one of the dealer in particular be pretty_much a racist and decide to get in a racially motivate political debate with -PRON-
completely inappropriate
-PRON- also would not stop complain_about how -PRON- be make minimum wage there for like 10_year which say something about -PRON- judgement to employ someone like that for 10_year without fire -PRON-
-PRON- also make -PRON- feel really guilty for drop a_few hundred dollar at the blackjack table instead_of tip -PRON- that money
-PRON- wish -PRON- have someone to report -PRON- to but -PRON- do_not really seem to care
-PRON- will_never be stay_at this hotel ever again and would never suggest that anyone_else do either especially with all of the competition on the strip
-PRON- can do much better
have be crave bagel and this_place do_not_disappoint
awesome soft chewy bagel
do_not have a great experience
the food be ehhh and -PRON- server do_not really do_not_know_what be happen
ask how big the serving be -PRON- answer -PRON- really do_not_know this be the first_time -PRON- open for brunch
-PRON- guess there be no stand up or -PRON- be late for the meeting
with other option in the area definitely not come_back
do_not like the small menu not enough variety_of food
way over price for the quality of food
-PRON- be a different_type_of mexican_food than what -PRON- be traditionally use to
-PRON- do_not like that -PRON- charge for everything even for rice and bean also charge_$ 4 for an_extra taco for the kid plate
probably will not return
-PRON- like this_place
-PRON- have a huge menu lot_of tv_'s and the service be fast and friendly

-PRON- have now be twice and plan to go again
-PRON- be casual like a chili 's or fridays but with good food
what not to love about the plant stand of arizona
-PRON- have be come_here for year since before -PRON- sell any retail to the public whatsoever
yes that be right
the plant stand only in recent year open up to the public for retail sale
-PRON- really do_not need to as -PRON- do just fine sell wholesale to the trade
-PRON- have be nice enough to accept retail customer and even expand -PRON- hour to be open on saturday
so when -PRON- go here as always know where -PRON- be
as for service- the staff be friendly and quite helpful enough for sure
do_not expect butt kiss retail sale clerk
be happy
-PRON- be in a wonderful fun atmosphere with the healthy fresh plant -PRON- will find anywhere in arizona
know that ask for a price list be how -PRON- shop
everything be mark with a code if not price
simply refer to -PRON- price list just like if -PRON- be buy wholesale
acres and acres of texture size and choice
fun
break away_from bore strip breakfast and come over here
this_place be an_absolute gem
-PRON- must_try the jamms french_toast
-PRON- do_not even like french_toast that much
and this be good
sandy be among the good server -PRON- have have
-PRON- have not be there in 4 month and -PRON- remember -PRON- name
-PRON- promise -PRON- be not just say that because sandy 's omelette be the good egg on the menu
can_not say enough about the pot of bread
try whatev the special be
-PRON- have never go_wrong
worth the wait but if -PRON- avoid weekend from 9:30-noon -PRON- should be fine
this be by_far -PRON- favorite haunt attraction in the pittsburgh\/philadelphia area
after -PRON- find the parking area -PRON- be meet with a white bloody hand halloween bus next stop
demon house residence
-PRON- aboard the decorate bus and take about a half mile ride to the haunt site
as -PRON- step down onto the pathway -PRON- will find ghoulish scene and creepy flickering light light up the pathway
as -PRON- approach the ticket booth -PRON- will find every inch of scenery paint with a spark of halloween and spooky effect
the portable bathroom be behind a wooden enclosure line with skeleton
there be a really_cool t_shirt booth beanie hat sweatshirt t shirts- $_15 with white stencil image that -PRON- press onto black t_shirt
-PRON- purchase a t_shirt with a jason mask and a t_shirt with night of the live dead image
with the $ 39 groupon -PRON- purchase -PRON- friend and -PRON- get in with vip access and get $_5 voucher that -PRON- could use on concession item and the merchandise stand
there be an outdoor theater that play horror film in which -PRON- can sip on -PRON- hot cider or coffee and watch the spooky classic
there be also a couple picnic table -PRON- can sit_down talk and eat at
there be a skeleton water fountain which be fun to sit on and take picture by
there be also bonfire -PRON- can sit by and warm up with
-PRON- think -PRON- be wonderful that -PRON- have a speaker system in which -PRON- group number be verbally call out so no line wait for -PRON-
woo hoo
-PRON- do_not get much good_than that
there be haunt pathway\/outdoor haunt attraction that -PRON- will partake in before -PRON- enter the actual demon house which feel_like two haunt attraction in one
take -PRON- word when -PRON- say go now
-PRON- will not regret -PRON-
oh and take cash
-PRON- may have to pay a toll to get on route 8
the place be simply decorate small and peaceful
the food be fresh and delicious
the service be great and everyone be really nice even close to closing time
-PRON- want to try a new thai place and this one just happen to catch -PRON- eye
really glad
-PRON- will_definitely have to eat_here again
good stuff
-PRON- be in_town for a couple day on business and decide to try soho
-PRON- boss and -PRON- stop in on a tuesday to grab a bite to eat and have a drink or three
-PRON- have the soho chicken florentine and -PRON- gluttenous superior order an entire chicken alfredo pizza
-PRON- both pig out
4_star for so so service
worth -PRON- though
okay yes -PRON- be gimmicky touristy and completely over the top but -PRON- be fun and the burger be delicious
-PRON- guess -PRON- could take or leave the fire cook in lard as_far as -PRON- could tell -PRON- be not really any good or bad than the peanut oil cook fry at five guy but -PRON- enjoy -PRON- enough
-PRON- do_not go for the milk shake with a stick of butter in -PRON- that seem gross but -PRON- do enjoy some nice trashy pbr while -PRON- be there
the only_reason -PRON- be not go to give five_star be because of the beer
cans only and of the most trashy brand imaginable which be of_course keep with the theme
but -PRON- would have much enjoy a good ipa or stout as_oppose to colt 45
great service
charles recently spray -PRON- home and -PRON- be very_pleased_with the service -PRON- provide
-PRON- not only spray -PRON- home but suggest how to keep bug out without have to consistently spray -PRON- home like other company pressure -PRON- to do
-PRON- do_not want to waste -PRON- many like other company and do_not make -PRON- sign a contract either
go with -PRON- service and -PRON- will not be disappoint
cute_little place tuck_away in a small strip_mall
delicious ice_cream and macaroon
love the netflix and chill flavor
definitely a new go to place for a yummy dessert
so -PRON- come_here on -PRON- trip to vegas because -PRON- hear someone rave_about -PRON- and all of the review say -PRON- be good
well that_being_say -PRON- be kind_of disappointed
-PRON- do_not really know_what the fuss be about
-PRON- have people sell candy cd flower a song form a mariachi and -PRON- feel bad for say no but also feel a_bit harassed
-PRON- be just try to have a nice dinner with -PRON- husband if -PRON- want any of those thing -PRON- would go to the store or approach -PRON-
the place -PRON- be nice inside look clean but the location be a_bit sketch at night which be when -PRON- go
the night -PRON- go -PRON- guess the atm 's go down
so -PRON- want to write down -PRON- card number and then do the transaction the next_day
-PRON- hesitantly give -PRON- -PRON- credit_card because -PRON- do_not want -PRON- husband -PRON- to use -PRON- debit_card
that turn_out ok but everything that experience overall be weird
save -PRON- money or go_somewhere_else
basis for -PRON- starred rating which skew heavily to the food or drink 1_star never again
2_star poor food poor experience extraordinary measure in order for -PRON- to come_back
3_star average nothing really special nothing particularly bad
4_star very good would definitely_return
5_star a favorite one of the good
be here a_few time always like -PRON- this last_time be the good and finally bump -PRON- up to 5_star
-PRON- order marinate tendon hot and spicy pig ear an oxtail noodle_soup and a beef rib noodle_soup
the marinate tendon and spicy pig ear be both good
chewy well_season no_complaint
the review mainly go to what should be the star here the noodle
sometimes the broth here can be a little salty
not today
clean beefy taste balance with herbal note from cilantro
the noodle be plentiful and perfectly cooked
-PRON- be long good chew good thickness
the meat in each of -PRON- bowl be kind_of an afterthought
-PRON- can order whatev meat -PRON- want and the broth and noodle be go to taste the same
the meat be a welcome but unnecessary addition to this excellent bowl of noodle_soup
-PRON- also heartily recommend the noodle with xo sauce
these be a fry noodle and the sauce be great
really delicious
a little oily but delicious
hand pull noodle be just superior in most way to factory noodle and the noodle here measure up to great pulled noodle in nyc and la
stay -PRON- a couple of night while visit some friend
like -PRON- much more_than other casino hotel -PRON- have be to
whereas most force -PRON- to walk_through the smoky casino to get from one place to another here most of the hotel be separate with a nice airy atrium to walk_through
that say to get to the buffet and ice_cream parlor -PRON- do have to go to the casino but there be several other food option off the atrium from a simple food court to a midrange barbecue to a pricey steakhouse
can_not even believe how amazing this_place be
-PRON- have a raman that be a special miso_raman
so good
someone mention fatty broth but -PRON- like -PRON- because -PRON- be really rich and so full of flavour
-PRON- daughter have the chicken_wing which be amazing and the beef tendon kind_of surprise -PRON- b\/c
-PRON- be not expect tendon
but -PRON- eat -PRON- like a champ
the service be excellent also
-PRON- will be back without question
-PRON- have $_250 leave on -PRON- windtab and be go to switch to a cheap plan
-PRON- rep offer a $_100 promo if -PRON- have less_than $ 150 on -PRON- windtab
so -PRON- pay_$ 100 to qualify on the spot
guess_what
the next bill come as $_250 not only do -PRON- lie about the promo -PRON- be penalize for switch the plan
call the customer_service over 10 time and write to the headquarters a month_ago
all -PRON- do so_far be to cut -PRON- service and force -PRON- to pay
luckily -PRON- contract end in june
for those_who be consider to sign with wind -PRON- may put up with the horrible signal for save a_few buck per month but may end_up pay -PRON- all back one day if not more
judge from the comment -PRON- be sure -PRON- be not the only one
never with -PRON- again
-PRON- son and -PRON- drive up from cincinnati to see the techno band echos at the agora
-PRON- be a blast
friendly_staff and lightning quick transition between act
the cafe have the good cobb salad -PRON- have ever have far and away
amanda be an_amazing photographer
-PRON- get some of the good shot of -PRON- wedding
-PRON- be on_top_of a mountain and -PRON- capture the beauty of -PRON- perfectly
-PRON- be so happy with every photo -PRON- take
-PRON- be so sweet and quick to respond to email and phone_call and get the picture back to -PRON- immediately
thank amanda
there be only one guy work here at about 1:30 pm on a thursday -PRON- be do everything take order ring people up do the cooking and restock ingredient with many glove change in between so be prepared to wait
after wait in line for about 20_min to place an order with only about 4_people in front of -PRON- -PRON- wait next_door at the bar for another 20_min to get -PRON- food
when -PRON- dog finally be ready -PRON- be delicious but to think this may be a quick_bite and -PRON- would be mistaken
-PRON- have the original dog and -PRON- hubby have the mutt dog -PRON- say -PRON- be very spicy
-PRON- love the east_coast hot_dog bun -PRON- do_not get here on the west_coast
nicely butter and grill
ehhh
the charlotte observer may be the good -PRON- have around_town in the form of a newspaper but -PRON- be not a fan
while -PRON- do cover a wide_variety of news much like any_other newspaper in_town nothing really jump out at -PRON- about -PRON-
-PRON- use to read -PRON- every morning when -PRON- parent get -PRON- but now -PRON- only read the online edition
-PRON- just change -PRON- online layout
but -PRON- be still the same ole stuff
each every_day
so the charlotte disturber will provide -PRON- with plenty_of news but nothing about the journalism that go into -PRON- will astound -PRON-
-PRON- be a forever pizza lover
and after eat at bff- -PRON- be hooked
the build -PRON- own concept be not a new one subway and chipotle have the market for awhile but watch out there be a new kid in_town
one tip- know -PRON- order before -PRON- get up the the counter
people be anxiously wait in line and when -PRON- can_not decide and take too_long -PRON- make other -PRON- include get a little hangry
the first_time ordering can be a_bit intimidating but -PRON- will quickly get the hang of -PRON-
-PRON- will walk -PRON- through the process
-PRON- love how quickly the pizza come_out and how crunchy crisp and thin the crust be
-PRON- call -PRON- a pizza cracker
there be a build -PRON- own option or a_few a popular pizza combo
-PRON- order 2 byo and one drink and -PRON- be under 20$.
-PRON- take a_few slice home to eat for dinner
-PRON- leave feel satisfied but not overstuff and greasy which be a good thing
-PRON- like that there be an_employee work the dining_room
-PRON- clear table wipe -PRON- down and ask how -PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal and if -PRON- need anything
a nice extra touch
-PRON- would warn this_place be loud
so do_not come_here for an intimate date
there be table outside but eat near all the car in the parking_lot be really not -PRON- idea of enjoyable
yay to a great pizza option in lv
-PRON- would like to see all employee wear hair net under -PRON- hat
also the hair need to be pull back under the hat- so_many lady have piece_of hair dangle out from underneath- too close to the pizza and ingredient
this_place be wonderful
hard to find good cajun food in the valley really only this_place and another that be worth the time
-PRON- stop in last_weekend after a family outing
-PRON- be refer to -PRON- which be good because the location be a_bit hard to find
-PRON- have drive_past -PRON- dozen of time and not know -PRON- be there
-PRON- be tuck_away behind a drug store and bank with no frontage
so -PRON- have to look for -PRON-
-PRON- try s little of everything
-PRON- have the gumbo and -PRON- be perfect and true to form for the picky of -PRON-
the only_downside -PRON- could even call to mind be the catfish bite
a number_of -PRON- have skin on -PRON- still which be a no no in -PRON- grandmother kitchen
but -PRON- be still do right
next_time -PRON- will try the catfish poboy -PRON- see one come_out that look outstanding
one of the big criterion -PRON- have for cajun be the red_bean and rice next_time
great food and nice folk
stop in and give -PRON- a try
-PRON- and -PRON- daughter have a wonderful time there few_week_ago
great atmosphere very pleasant service all around attentive cashier\/server name ruby
delicious food with affordable and reasonable_price
even_though the place be about chicken chicken chicken the menu in whole seem very health conscious and with many option for vegetarian such_as -PRON-
-PRON- love -PRON- and definitely_come_back
-PRON- think -PRON- have find -PRON- favorite place in_vegas
this_place offer everything
great food awesome bar neat place to shop
this_place be perfect if -PRON- just want to waste a_few hour walk_around
-PRON- have an_awesome movie_theater and even a guitar center to suite anyone 's need
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_place to anyone look for a good bite to eat or to even get -PRON- shopping fix on
definitely a regular here
great experience
-PRON- always get -PRON- in for same_day appointment and do exactly_what -PRON- ask
also -PRON- price be very very_reasonable compare to other place
-PRON- be also fairly good with the amount_of time -PRON- take because -PRON- really do_not want -PRON- pup stay in a cage for 5 6_hour
location
location
location
tourist trap
this_place thrive and still exist because of -PRON- be location to the harbor
there be really nothing to say about this_place
take the most average service combine -PRON- with pre frozen dish and add a dash of predictability and -PRON- have watermark the most generic forgettable
pub\/restaurant
food be good coffee be good location be relatively easy to get to and park at
so why the 2_star
the service suck a lot
start go to coca a few_year_ago and the service staff use to be super_nice
-PRON- always expect a long_wait but -PRON- always make -PRON- feel_welcome so -PRON- do_not_mind
however the past 3_4 time -PRON- have be there the service have go way downhill
from the greeting to the service at the table
wow
2nd to last_time
-PRON- go
-PRON- be tell 1_hour for 3 people
stand around outside for a_bit get cold and go inside to buy a to go coffee which -PRON- have always be able_to do before
be tell by one of the server that -PRON- be discourage to get coffee before -PRON- sit_down so -PRON- can go get coffee down the street in a condescending why be -PRON- bother -PRON- tone
um -PRON- discourage people to buy coffee from -PRON-
last_time -PRON- go another 1 hr wait for 2 people
come_back 30min later and want to see_how far -PRON- be on the list
the server snatch up the list and say an_hour from whenever -PRON- first tell -PRON- and walk_away
nice
so -PRON- go to square cafe instead in regent square just as busy just as many_people but far nice and actually apologize for the 20min
wait time
nothing particularly wrong with ross
-PRON- buy nearly all of -PRON- clothe here
however -PRON- need to be honest with -PRON- about what -PRON- be get into
ross be a place where people go to buy thing at a very low price which be why -PRON- go
-PRON- get exactly_what -PRON- would expect from a low end department store
the patron be generally not in any hurry
make a quick trip to ross be usually not in the card
that be say the saving be worth -PRON- to -PRON- and -PRON- will_continue to shop there
great massage today from linda
-PRON- love_this_place
-PRON- be a warm atmosphere with a great relaxing ambiance
-PRON- also try the infrared sauna for the first_time before -PRON- massage 15_minute and -PRON- be great
highly_recommend
be crave for a dutch brother 's coffee and remember that this open up nearby so decide to give -PRON- a try
the exterior and menu look similar to that of dutch brother 's and sport two drive thrus go two different direction which -PRON- think be efficient
let the cashier\/barista know -PRON- be -PRON- first_time and if -PRON- could recommend -PRON- something base_on -PRON- preference in coffee
-PRON- end_up grab an_iced talon which be an ice_coffee drink with hazelnut vanilla and chocolate
taste -PRON- and be actually pleased_with the drink though definitely on the sweet side
if -PRON- make drink like dutch -PRON- be safe to assume that the chocolate come from chocolate milk
the drink be creamy sweet and portion_size be well for the price
however after chug down -PRON- drink -PRON- can say that the coffee lack in caffeine which mean -PRON- day be not as productive without -PRON- vice
for those with a sweet_tooth -PRON- would probably love -PRON- here
definitely sweet but without the buzz
the service be pretty similar to that of dutch drive_thru be not too quick but get go and the staff be not_overly chirpy which can be a good thing when -PRON- be yet to be caffeinat
the guy_who help -PRON- be friendly and give a good suggestion base_on preference and make -PRON- drink quickly
price here be the same as dutch do use square for credit purchase and have a stamp card
pretty_good drink this time around but would like to try another drink to back up this review
-PRON- know for science
from the high and low review on de perhaps -PRON- have an_issue with consistency
until next_time
francais après
this be -PRON- favorite pizza in montreal
this_place be great for a lot_of reason 1 there be ridiculous amount_of different topping like rick v say in previous review like 70 pizza
2 -PRON- can get out of there tip include for 20 $_3
the place be always pack and the service be still fast
on lunch hour if -PRON- actually have 45 60 minute lunch and work within 5_minute walk -PRON- will make -PRON-
4 wooden burn oven
first_time -PRON- go there be with a group_of collegue of 15_20 person and within 75 minute -PRON- be all do
pizza be the most delicious fast_food on planet earth -PRON- could die eat pizza 2_3 time a day for the rest_of -PRON- live
top definition be infinite and therefore -PRON- can make everything in a pizza and this_place be a commitment to prove -PRON-
the calzonne be super great too c' ma pizza favorite à montréal
cet endroit est superbe pour plusieur raison 1
c' qu'il ont un nombre ridicule de garniture
comme le review précédent le mentionne plus de 70
2
tu peux quitter le resto le ventre plein pour 20 $ après tip
3 ce_resto est toujour rempli et malgré tout le service est rapide
durant l'heure du lunch si vous avez 45 60 minute et
que vous ête
à 5_minute
du resto a pied vous pouvez diner là san revenir en retard au boulot
4 3 mots four à bois
la première fois que je suis allé là nous étion un groupe de 15_20 collègue et en
moin de 75 minute tout le monde était servi avait mangé et payé
la rapidité et la qualité vont de paire pour moi
ils ont définitivement une recette gagnante
la pizza c'est à mon avis le meilleur fast_food
au monde
je pourrai en manger
2_3 fois par jour
jusqu'à
la fin de me jours juste à because de l'infinis possibilité de garniture
san compté que ça peut contenir tous les groupe alimentaire en une bouchée
ah et il ont des calzone ridiculement bon
-PRON- be really disappointed with how staples handle a rebate for an item -PRON- purchase
-PRON- mention this to melissa the assistant manager and without bat an eye -PRON- make -PRON- right
-PRON- be impressed_with -PRON- helpfulness and willingness to fix the problem
-PRON- have debate ever return to staples again and be now glad that -PRON- do
order the muffalata bread be hard as a rock have no flavor which be amazing for something literally cover in marinate chop up olive
boyfriend order the burger -PRON- be burn on one side
-PRON- order -PRON- medium_rare
this_place have get to go
base_on the other_review -PRON- think -PRON- should close down and be replace
pdq in concord nc be a new and rapidly grow restaurant chain base off of a local gem in cornelius nc call tenders fresh food
like the original the food be phenomenal
pdq do food the right way -PRON- can immediately tell the quality from the first_bite
the texture be splendid and the flavor of the fresh chicken to the daily homemade sauce be out of this_world
-PRON- be truly amazing be able_to watch this business take off right in -PRON- backyard and -PRON- wish -PRON- the good of luck
for those_who have never be pdq and tender for that matter do chicken and that be about -PRON-
-PRON- do have one crispy turkey sandwich but the headliner here be the chicken
-PRON- still remember -PRON- first bite_into chicken tender from pdq about a year and a half ago all that -PRON- could think of be wow

#hiddengem
visit on_tuesday 29th march use a groupon voucher go early door before head to see greg davies at royal festival hall far_superior to this experience
arrive to a restaurant with just two other table of people in -PRON- to be fair -PRON- be only 5.30pm but for some_reason get stick right_next to another couple despite load of empty seat and the next couple half_an_hour later get put directly next to -PRON-
the starter minestrone soup and pizza garlic_bread with tomato be ok
nothing flash but edible at_least
the main however nothing tricky a parma ham pizza and a mushroom ham and pepperoni_pizza be awful bland tasteless undercooked and stodgy the ham be reform nonsense and the pepperoni full of fat
obviously the guy serve look_like maybe the owner spot the vast leftover on the plate and ask what be wrong to which -PRON- discreetly point out the pizza be undercook and tasteless -PRON- reaction a shrug and wander off to fetch -PRON- the bill
interesting take on customer_service
-PRON- would thoroughly recommend go to any number_of other far good eatery in edinburgh -PRON- be review at_least two other after this that be outstanding shame some continue to appal whilst those around shine brighter
and to top -PRON- off the place be filthy
avoid
this_place be not good at all
-PRON- do_not change the grill when need and the brisket sauce taste_like water
the marinate pork be not appetizing
also -PRON- run out of brisket sauce
-PRON- could have make more
while everyone_else stand in line at deluca 's pamela 's primanti 's -PRON- be perfectly happy to step right into cafe raymond and have a delicious breakfast or lunch
the first_time -PRON- stop in here for a quick lunch and be intrigue by the veggie muffuletta
-PRON- come with portabella mushroom as the meat
although -PRON- be not quite as good as the original -PRON- be certainly tasty and a_bit healthy
since then -PRON- have be here_several_time for breakfast and lunch
everything -PRON- have try have be excellent and the service be always good
there be very clean restroom facility in the basement for customer a good find in the strip
as a matter of fact the whole restaurant be clean and bright with a definite new_orleans vibe
there be always water with fresh lemon available as self_serve
the bread be homemade on_site and so be the breakfast sausage
-PRON- really love_this_place
bad service -PRON- have ever have in an airport twice
-PRON- first trip to this_location be right after -PRON- open so -PRON- chalk up the poor service to that
today as -PRON- sit here at the bar -PRON- wait 8_minute to be ask if -PRON- want anything all while three bar employee feel the need to clean the bar and drink -PRON- own drink instead_of ask -PRON- if -PRON- need help
-PRON- ask for a glass of water to start
again all three girl go_back to clean thing and chat instead_of actually get -PRON- that glass of water and take the rest_of -PRON- order
finally after -PRON- ask a girl if -PRON- be here to help -PRON- after wait another 5_minute
-PRON- give -PRON- a disgust look as if -PRON- be bother -PRON-
nothing have change -PRON- must have the same incompetent person train everyone
-PRON- will absolutely never come_back to another wahlburger no_matter where -PRON- be
cafe zupas be now one of -PRON- favorite place to go
get the try 2 combo and -PRON- will be so full and the food be so tasty
plus the chocolate_cover strawberry be a perfect touch at the end
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- go here for dinner a few_week_ago after a happy_hour
-PRON- work in east liberty and have be want to try this_place for a while
-PRON- arrive there around 8 on a friday_night and -PRON- be able_to be seat_right_away
-PRON- have the choice of sit_at bar which overlook wood_fire cooking area
however -PRON- opt_for a high top table by a window
first of all there be so_many thing on the menu that -PRON- want to try
so -PRON- have a hard time decide what to order
-PRON- go with the buffalo chicken grill_cheese and -PRON- boyfriend get the skillet pasta
-PRON- food come_out very quickly and -PRON- be so delicious
-PRON- grill_cheese have a kick from the buffalo sauce but the chicken have that wood_fire taste
yum
-PRON- order the campfire smore for dessert
-PRON- come_out in a little cast iron skillet
-PRON- have a layer of chocolate then some golden grahams and then all of that goodness be top with roasted marshmallow
amazing
finally because like -PRON- say -PRON- could_not decide on what -PRON- want
-PRON- order the roasted corn dip to take home
-PRON- eat -PRON- the next_day with the parmesan pita chip and
oh -PRON- gee
-PRON- be delicious
-PRON- will_definitely be back again
on_top_of everything_else the staff be so friendly and accommodate
-PRON- have a very great experience overall
-PRON- have never have bad_experience at this_place until quite recently
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- go there for breakfast this week order a sandwich two latte and a muffin and -PRON- could_not stop rant about how bad the food be on the way home
the latte have a terrible aftertaste and the muffin honestly taste_like something -PRON- would get from 7 11
and -PRON- be a bizarre neon yellow color
very unappetizing
-PRON- be mostly just frustrated because -PRON- have be come to madhouse for year and have always enjoy the food\/drink
-PRON- always recall the latte be excellent and make with the actual tea bag instead_of syrup
and the pastry be delicious and homemade
-PRON- both decide not to frequent madhouse anymore especially after drop 20 buck for food -PRON- end_up throw away when -PRON- get home
what a great find
this_place serve up great austrian fare at a reasonable_price highly_recommend
-PRON- try the ultimate wash and -PRON- do a very good job
-PRON- have be try place around -PRON- for awhile and classic car_wash have be the good for a good wash not detail that -PRON- try so_far

and if -PRON- be that be -PRON- problem bra
-PRON- thoroughly dislike this_place
the attention upon client -PRON- be bad the order take so long that by the time -PRON- bring the food -PRON- be not hungry anymore
the order be take around three_time due_to the waiter forget -PRON- order
-PRON- be loud and noisy and give that the review online say quintet -PRON- be surprised
-PRON- do_not serve haggi anymore and that be the main_reason -PRON- go to the restaurant

-PRON- also have a casual order at the counter lunchtime business

-PRON- remind -PRON- of a_few of the burrito place -PRON- use to frequent in the bay_area when -PRON- live out there
-PRON- even have the option for mojado style i favorito which take the finish burrito and soak -PRON- in enchilada sauce and melts cheese on_top
-PRON- be just as tasty as -PRON- sound
if -PRON- be on the run
-PRON- be easy to pick_up a burrito to go in foil and eat -PRON- while -PRON- drive
though -PRON- may be a good idea to sport a napkin over any sensitive clothing item
-PRON- be not good about this
cheap burrito
be not nothing wrong with that
this be a blast to run
-PRON- have do the half each of the last 3 yrs and the service organization keep get good good
-PRON- be a great course for a pr but there be lot_of inexperienced runner who do_not_know etiquette and will slow -PRON- down at time
the weather be usually ideal for distance run 50 's to low 60 's with not much of a breeze
of_course -PRON- still have horrible flashback of 2012 when -PRON- have 75 degree temp and a 20 mph constant headwind the last 5 mile

but -PRON- never once feel_like -PRON- be
-PRON- be really pretty out there
the inside look great and cozy and -PRON- believe -PRON- have a beautiful fireplace in the middle too
but -PRON- just walk straight out back and be not really pay much attention
-PRON- waitress be attentive and the food be time perfectly
-PRON- have the stuff eggplant and dolmade for -PRON- app
now as -PRON- be lebanese and -PRON- hubby egyptian mediterranean food be -PRON- life
the app blow -PRON- away so delicious and flavorful
-PRON- do bring_out a basket of hummus and pita but honestly and -PRON- can say this be nowhere near how -PRON- like -PRON- hummus and taste_like chickpea only no tahini and or season
but -PRON- be lebanese and -PRON- hummus pretty_much take the cake
and -PRON- be a snob about -PRON-
move on -PRON- have the sea_bass and -PRON- have the moussaka again omg delicious
the moussaka could feed 4_people -PRON- be very large
-PRON- sea_bass be perfectly prepared and beyond burst with flavor
to end -PRON- have to get the ekmek as -PRON- be one of -PRON- favorite dessert
fluffy custard pistachio whip_cream crunchy sweet syrup base
-PRON- die think of how amazing this be here -PRON- actually have not stop think about -PRON- since -PRON- leave a week_ago
-PRON- be so big which be a good thing because -PRON- could_not get enough and unfortunately have to share with the hubby
great for -PRON- waistline
-PRON- guess
but -PRON- be already prepare for -PRON- next meal there
-PRON- be now a favorite spot of -PRON-
-PRON- definitely should go seriously go
love_this_place
clean atmosphere great food and friendly bartender
-PRON- go during the week on a wednesday not crowd at all and quickly sit_at the bar
try the mashed pizza
the bbq bison be good -PRON- get -PRON- without mushroom and like -PRON-
so yummy
trinity be awesome
-PRON- never feel so relaxed
-PRON- be one of the good message i have so_far
will recommend to everyone
-PRON- make_an_appointment to go here over the weekend for a bridesmaid dress
the wedding be next month
so -PRON- be very short notice which -PRON- realize
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be show where the bridesmaid dress section be
-PRON- be surprised on how small the selection be
luckily in the end -PRON- find 2 dress that -PRON- do really like
after select the dress that -PRON- want to try on -PRON- go to the fitting room where -PRON- have misplace -PRON- dress already
-PRON- do_not go too_far away but still if -PRON- be reserve a room for -PRON- why would the dress be move
the price seem okay
-PRON- range_from $ 100-$139
the person that -PRON- have an_appointment with be not very_helpful
-PRON- do_not offer to get any_other size for -PRON- or anything
-PRON- have have much good service at bcbg at the outlet mall -PRON- think -PRON- have the good customer_service when -PRON- come to clothing
turn_out some of the style -PRON- select to try on do_not even come in the color -PRON- need
ummm that would have be nice to know before -PRON- try on 10 dress
after decide on the two style -PRON- want -PRON- inquire about order -PRON- and if -PRON- would be here in time
turn_out -PRON- would not work out
-PRON- guess -PRON- need more_than a month to have a dress ship to the store
really
when -PRON- go home
-PRON- look online and notice that -PRON- have dress that be online exclusive
the shipping time be not bad either 8 11 business day
-PRON- be currently run a promotion for free shipping too
why do_not the sale associate mention this
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not set on any style and be pretty flexible
funny too because one of the dress -PRON- really like can be order online too in -PRON- size and the correct color
when -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- come in another shade of purple
-PRON- need -PRON- say probably not
why would not -PRON- look
and guess_what -PRON- be offer
so -PRON- look_like -PRON- will be get the dress -PRON- need as_well_as the rest_of the bridal party
however -PRON- be without the help of the staff and all through research of -PRON- own
-PRON- would not recommend use david_'s bridal for bridesmaid dress and will choose to go_somewhere_else in the future after this experience
the suncoast be a great movie_theater for 2 important reason 1 the price be great
-PRON- even better on_tuesday where -PRON- $_5 for any movie
2 -PRON- also show movie that be not name captain america and off the beaten path
for_example -PRON- have many of the nominate movie prior to oscar sunday
something that_s very hard to find here in_vegas
the movie theatre be locate_in the suncoast casino so be prepared to walk_through a cloud of smoke in the casino to reach the movie theatre
-PRON- also would benefit from a renovation with newer\/plusher seating and decor
but -PRON- understand that good amenity = more expensive price
another great feature be that -PRON- extremely easy to find a parking spot versus red rock regal theatre
no hassle no frill just a very solid theatre for local
this_place have a civil war era bar table and an impressive range of hard to find beer_on_tap
the interior be very comfortable and lay_back like a brewery enthusiast 's club house
-PRON- make for a great euchre location
-PRON- visit on a friday_night and -PRON- be not crowd at all
plus both the patron and the publican be courteous and not obnoxious
2_star
okay so -PRON- move into the area a few_week_ago and this_place be just a stone 's throw away so -PRON- be just a matter of time till -PRON- try -PRON-
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- refuse to learn from -PRON- own mistake or maybe -PRON- be just a little thick
-PRON- should have listen to -PRON- fellow_yelper
in a nutshell very overpriced for what -PRON- get and service take_forever
-PRON- pull_up to the drive_thru to order nobody be in line in front of -PRON-
nobody appear to be in the restaurant at all
-PRON- order a mustang burger and a regular fry
no drink
this come to 7.44
ouch
at_least kiss -PRON- first
okay let see what this get -PRON-
-PRON- pull forward pay for item with -PRON- card and wait
and wait
and wait
at about the 8_minute mark -PRON- think somebody may possibly be out back kill the cow
sheesh
from the time -PRON- get -PRON- card back to the time -PRON- hand -PRON- the bag be 11 minute
11 minute
grant the girl do apologize for the wait(which -PRON- -PRON- describe as forever but that whole scene be just rediculous
-PRON- get the extra star because the burger actually be good
just not nearly good enough to justify that price or wait
the fry be very generic like jack in the box fry
blah
-PRON- do get a heap mess of -PRON- too(for 2.89
sorry -PRON- will not be back at all
just not worth the price or the wait
not even close
do an okay job
-PRON- be happy with the full set and the price -PRON- pay for them.but once -PRON- get home
-PRON- start to chip
and look really uneven with the nail
-PRON- put over 4 coast of polish on the nail -PRON- be to hide the rough part of the nail since -PRON- do_not buff -PRON- out as_well_as -PRON- should of
give two start for the over all price of the service not the quality of the nail
-PRON- be tell that -PRON- smoke_meat fry_rice be great
so -PRON- order one smoke_meat fry_rice and one smoke_meat pizza
the smoke_meat fry_rice be ok but -PRON- be impressed_by the pizza
there be a lot_of smoke_meat on the pizza -PRON- be so delicious
-PRON- will_definitely go there next_time and try other smoke_meat dish
currently -PRON- mouth have decide that -PRON- be a walk money tree and that -PRON- should give in great quantity at this time in -PRON- life
dr._house be refer to -PRON- a few_year_ago
-PRON- go in to see -PRON- get -PRON- xray and startling news that basically -PRON- entire mouth have to be overhaul
-PRON- think -PRON- be in such shock and disbelief that -PRON- neatly tuck -PRON- far far_away in the depth of -PRON- dental mental hell hop -PRON- would not rear -PRON- be ugly head again
well that do_not happen
that_being_say let -PRON- give -PRON- a little of -PRON- dental hellistery so -PRON- can fully comprehend how amazing dr._house be and why -PRON- should call -PRON- -PRON- dentist
-PRON- start have dental work when -PRON- be 8 year_old
filling root_canal crown etc
not because -PRON- necessarily need -PRON- but because -PRON- parent be naive to a new young dentist just out of dental school who want a new house and fancy sport car and want -PRON- parent to pay for -PRON-
-PRON- be -PRON- practice patient
-PRON- know this to -PRON- core
-PRON- do however do great if not excruciatingly painful work
-PRON- last -PRON- 30 year
-PRON- decide -PRON- want the amalgam silver crown filling out of -PRON- mouth about 8 year_ago
this be do and -PRON- have to also get 3 root_canal redone at that time
-PRON- develop some autoimmune symptom to say the least but never correlate -PRON- with -PRON- new supposedly holistic dental work
fast_forward to this past labor day weekend 2011
a crown crack and split in half as -PRON- be munch on -PRON- lunch
omg
holiday weekend what do -PRON- do
-PRON- so and daughter both use dr._house
-PRON- say call -PRON- see what -PRON- say
-PRON- office be 5_minute from the house
maybe
well -PRON- not only return -PRON- call
-PRON- meet -PRON- there in 10_minute
mind -PRON-
-PRON- be not a patient at this point
-PRON- be gracious and welcoming although -PRON- be leave on_vacation within the hour with -PRON- husband and two kid
-PRON- get suit up etc
in the chair
oh geez here -PRON- go
-PRON- be look in -PRON- eye as -PRON- be look inside this tooth
and -PRON- see a look of omg
wth
and oh_my
yet -PRON- say yes -PRON- be crack -PRON- be bad and not only that but someone leave pack gauze in -PRON- root_canal 8 year_ago
so -PRON- get that out sterilize -PRON- put a temp on call in antibiotic and pain med for -PRON- till -PRON- get back from -PRON- trip
awesome and nerve racking
-PRON- never once say -PRON- tell -PRON- so a few_year_ago not once
dr._house just give -PRON- a hug and say let -PRON- just move_forward
and -PRON- have
since then -PRON- have have 3 root_canal refer out to dr. axx 2 extraction refer out to dr. sabol and 2 crown 2 filling and a 3 part bridge and 1 fill to go in the next couple of week
have -PRON- listen to -PRON- 2_3 year_ago -PRON- probably would not have have to endure all of this in emergency situation
-PRON- do_not take -PRON- insurance but -PRON- do_not_care
-PRON- trust -PRON- tooth only to -PRON- and whom -PRON- refer -PRON- to
-PRON- have be to dental hell and back twice
dr._house and -PRON- crew be -PRON- save angels
finally
-PRON- have such anxiety and fear all of these year
put -PRON- all off until -PRON- all become an emergency be not the way to go
however -PRON- land -PRON- with -PRON- and there be no place -PRON- would_rather be in a dental emergency or just for a cleaning or fill than with dr._house
dr._house have an_amazing new beautiful state of the art office great staff and warm environment
if -PRON- be look for a great dentist -PRON- just find -PRON-
btw
-PRON- have friend that crack a front tooth off open a box two week_ago
-PRON- call dr. h for -PRON-
-PRON- meet -PRON- at -PRON- new office not even open yet on a friday_night numb -PRON- up clean -PRON- up put on a temp and get -PRON- out the door within an_hour
-PRON- friend be not a patient of -PRON- either at that time
dr._house have amazing customer_service
-PRON- text -PRON- email -PRON- and follow_up with phone_call
love a dentist that be hip on the communication
maybe a 2_star only because -PRON- be the only taco place around
-PRON- have live about a 5-minute walk from here pretty_much all -PRON- life and -PRON- love taco
-PRON- excitement sky rocket when -PRON- notice this little place open up so close to home and finally come to check -PRON- out a couple week_ago
the owner of le canard mort close down the former le resignol and open this new little taco bar
-PRON- have never be to the other restaurant but le canard mort have definitely be on -PRON- radar and -PRON- cross -PRON- finger -PRON- will be much good_than this
there be two of -PRON- when -PRON- come and think -PRON- be close because -PRON- be so dark and empty
-PRON- could have just be because -PRON- be late afternoon during down time but -PRON- have never see more_than 2 people in here at a time anyway
-PRON- be casually greet and -PRON- pick_up a menu off the table
-PRON- consist_of enchilada $ 13-$16 burrito $ 9-$12 nachos and a_few salad
the taco range_from $_4.50 to $_9 each or -PRON- can choose to get the platter of 2 which include rice and salad
and so for a quick lunch blacken catfish taco platter $_14 2\/5 star the fish -PRON- be cook and season well
however -PRON- be not hot warm at good
the yellow mole lack flavour and the mango salsa be meh
-PRON- can make way better
overall a bit_dry and lack in flavour and heat
very_disappointed with the platter aspect since -PRON- be a tiny scoop of bland rice with what seem_like canned black_bean heat in a microwave and pour on_top
the salad be several lettuce leaf with
-PRON- forgot what else not worth the mention anyway
shrimp_taco platter $_14 1.5\/stars
shrimp be cook well but definitely lack flavour chipotle mole be inexistent accord to -PRON- taste_bud
the tomatillo salsa be alright but miss the bold taste tomatillo salsas promise to deliver
again a bit_dry
and -PRON- wish -PRON- have not get the platter double disappointment
service 2\/5 star 2.5 star
the server be nice but there be really nothing that be do to put -PRON- above the mcdonald_'s counter service
-PRON- originally ask to get the food to go but decide to stay after -PRON- get the food
-PRON- bring some utensil napkin and bottled sauce then -PRON- reach into -PRON- bag and take the package sauce back so -PRON- would not waste -PRON-
-PRON- mean -PRON- hate to waste and would have probably give -PRON- back anyway but seriously
-PRON- be a forgiving person
and -PRON- believe almost everyone deserve a second chance
chef_'s and restaurant have -PRON- bad day too so yes -PRON- will go_back one day to get one taco and hope that -PRON- will make up for everything
the concept be what -PRON- really admire but the food cook service and atmosphere need to step -PRON- up big time
alright so the review here be spot on
the sandwich here be very good and -PRON- can see why this_place be so busy all the time
-PRON- have both the cheese steak and the chicken parm both be excellent choice
and -PRON- be hard for -PRON- to decide on a favorite
-PRON- would like to try -PRON- pasta sometime here which only mean that -PRON- should come_back here on another visit
the location be a_bit tricky to find at first
but -PRON- be not_too_bad -PRON- be right_across from the china wok right_across from the parking_lot
-PRON- would_recommend call_ahead and order -PRON- food beforehand as -PRON- be quite busy during the lunch rush
as -PRON- be part grocery and part restaurant -PRON- would also recommend take out if -PRON- be busy since there be not much seating
-PRON- adore the parador
-PRON- be a really stunning old victorian that ed the owner have bring to life with a caribbean theme totally different charming and unique
-PRON- stay in the palm room which be at the very top of the stair and honestly that room really suite be big than -PRON- apartment in dc
there be a huge living room with a sofa a coffee table a desk a tv and fridge and ample ample space for lounge around a huge bedroom and a huge bathroom
in short -PRON- could have comfortably stay in -PRON- room for two day and leave pittsburgh very happy
but there be other plus here as_well one be the location
-PRON- can walk_out the door of the parador turn right and stumble into a number_of good restaurant literally a three minute walk
if -PRON- be head to pittsburgh to see the warhol museum or the mattress factory -PRON- can easily walk from the parador
and if -PRON- have question about what to see or where to go ed will help -PRON-
finally point for the morning breakfast especially the yogurt parfait
-PRON- get there at_11_a.m. on a sunday and there be 2 worker outside wait because the manager have not arrive yet
when -PRON- get there -PRON- tell -PRON- the other person do a no show at 10 a.m.
and -PRON- have to drive all the way from goodyear or such
-PRON- want to sit on the patio
so -PRON- just sit -PRON- while -PRON- let everyone in
-PRON- end_up not be able_to eat for almost 2_hour because the wood_fire oven have to get to a certain degree before -PRON- could cook the pizza
when -PRON- get -PRON- bill -PRON- be hand write on small piece_of paper super sketchy
-PRON- seriously feel_like ashton kutcher be go to jump out and say -PRON- be be punk because the service be so bad
-PRON- would not recommend to anyone
have -PRON- first float a few_week_ago and sleep like a baby afterwards
definitely do_not make plan after because all -PRON- will want to do be continue relax
-PRON- like that -PRON- be so thorough with what to expect before during and after the float
beautiful setup and friendly_staff
-PRON- have hear the 2nd float be even good_than the 1st -PRON- will for sure be test that out
love to see a business that be take_care_of -PRON- body without pump -PRON- full of medication
-PRON- do_not get what -PRON- be about the black bull that make people want to go there so bad
ok the patio be massive -PRON- get that part
but in case -PRON- do_not_know toronto have a ton_of other great patio
and chance be -PRON- will actually find a table on one of -PRON- unlike at the always ram black bull
-PRON- be locate_in the middle_of queen st which be cool except when someone set_up a drum kit next to the patio and play over the music come from the bb 's speaker
-PRON- be always an annoying corner -PRON- can_not deny that
can -PRON- talk_about the food for a second
-PRON- gross and utterly generic
-PRON- be obviously not the reason -PRON- head over there in the first place but let -PRON- face -PRON- people end_up want to nibble on something when -PRON- be drink cold beer on a hot day but the food always leave -PRON- wish -PRON- have not order anything in the first place
and oddly enough every_time -PRON- go there the server without fail will bring -PRON- a pint of the beer despite ask for a bottle_of
why be that
-PRON- never correct -PRON- because who do that -PRON- be beer
but -PRON- be really strange
-PRON- be not say do_not go
-PRON- mean if friend be already there and -PRON- actually score a table then by all mean join -PRON-
just do_not go with an appetite
-PRON- can honestly say this be the good italian food -PRON- have have
considering
-PRON- grow_up work for -PRON- uncle nunzie bear in italy at -PRON- restaurant
and -PRON- live 2 door down from a little old lady from sicily whose mission seem to be to feed the entire neighborhood when -PRON- could this be say a lot
from the spaghetti and meatball to the porcetta ragout -PRON- absolute_favorite when -PRON- be on the menu from the bread appetizer and dessert to the sandwich and bar selection everything be amazing
the staff be pleasant and attentive the owner walk the dining_area to make_sure everything be just right
-PRON- be decorate well and have a terrific atmosphere
this be -PRON- second_visit to this restaurant chain although the first_visit be in tempe not phoenix
-PRON- like the peanut stir_fry with mock chicken so_much in tempe -PRON- order -PRON- again at the downtown_phoenix location
unfortunately this version_of the dish be drown in so_much peanut_sauce
that -PRON- all -PRON- could taste
the veggie and mock chicken be cook right -PRON- be just that the dish be out of balance with too_much of a powerful ingredient
-PRON- have be customer of national home warranty for over 12 year
overall -PRON- have be bless because -PRON- have provide good service for all these year

-PRON- even stand at the large log tank try to get the last cardinal

sadly -PRON- be highly disappoint twice
-PRON- decide to get -PRON- father a canoli cake for -PRON- birthday this year 6\/18\/14 the big 66 retirement at last
too_bad -PRON- could_not be a memorable one where -PRON- cake take center stage
the cake be very different look from the pic on the website which -PRON- guess only apply to the hoboken location
there be no almond sliver around the cake the cream be kind_of heavy and very bland on the upside the vanilla sponge be ok just sad that all together -PRON- be not good
-PRON- also have the mini canoli original and chocolate -PRON- daughter think -PRON- be ok nothing_special
-PRON- have the napoleon this be the bad thing -PRON- have ever put in -PRON- mouth in the disguise of a dessert
the french cream be hard and -PRON- could tell have be sit around for a while the flaky pastry layer be more like thin sheet of cardboard -PRON- be tough and hard to bite through -PRON- almost break a tooth try to bite through -PRON- after a couple attempt the napoleon be totally destroy and look_like a firecracker go off in -PRON- for sure have be sit around for a while
lastly the line be redonkulous
-PRON- wait for over_an_hour and a half on a sat
night
and -PRON- be so wrong to see the favoritism on behalf of the young chubby white guy_who be at the door let people in
-PRON- see -PRON- let in 2 pretty young_lady totally bypass the line and walk right in
about 20_minute_later -PRON- do -PRON- again with a punk rocker tattooed pierced pink haired one side the other shaved girl

salesperson be helpful and actually propose a mattress purchase that be less_than what -PRON- plan to spend
now here come the cost mattress require a mattress pad or the warranty will be void $_50
delivery cost $ 69
delivery window be small weekend only
-PRON- miss the schedule delivery so there be a 10 restocking fee $ 139
-PRON- can_not pay this over the phone as customer_service can_not take the payment
-PRON- have to drive to the store and make the payment
wish -PRON- have ask more question as -PRON- be quick to make the sale but horrible in follow_up to assist with -PRON- the delivery
and seriously the restock_fee be ridiculous
needless_to_say
-PRON- be cancel the order lose money as -PRON- have to pay a restock_fee for cancel the order as_well
-PRON- will_never ever shop at the dump again
the name should be change to the dupe
that be how -PRON- feel

-PRON- come to mon ami gabi every_time -PRON- go to vegas -PRON- really do get all the up scale quality an service at a very_reasonable_price
kfc
popeyes
grocery_store fry_chicken
no
nononono triple crown
tip -PRON- hat to that kitchen team because that be one mind_blow food experience
the fry_chicken be flawless
-PRON- be a very_flavorful batter something very distinct about -PRON- similar to kfc but more flavorful and more addicting
-PRON- choose some elaborate side which -PRON- think clash against the chicken aside_from the sweet_potato which be ace
-PRON- also try the mac and cheese which be delicious
the biscuit be a_little_bit of a miss for -PRON- but -PRON- do_not_care
-PRON- be the chicken and that sauce that matter
order takeout
totally get -PRON- order wrong
the guy that take down -PRON- order obviously do_not_know the menu and be not familiar_with the japanese name
that_being_say the food be decent but nothing_special
the cupcake be super expensive and -PRON- have have much good
the carrot_cake cupcake have a strong after taste of nutmeg and cinnamon that overpower the taste
the red_velvet be just off
can_not really explain why
-PRON- be super_excited to finally try this shop and be very_disappointed
one of -PRON- favorite restaurant in_phoenix
love the protein style taco and yummy salsa_bar
-PRON- love condiment so the salsa_bar be a definite highlight for -PRON-
also -PRON- recently expand the restaurant so -PRON- be about double the size of what -PRON- use to be
-PRON- will be back again soon
dr. battersby be seriously amazing as a person and as a doctor
-PRON- have be to several doctor and have never have an experience like the one -PRON- have with dr. battersby
-PRON- understand_why as a doctor in_general one can easily develop the attitude after medical school and first hand experience that -PRON- know more about what may be go on with the patient and may not feel the need to listen as much or would not necessarily treat -PRON- as equal in knowledge
but with dr. battersby -PRON- literally feel_like -PRON- treat -PRON- as though -PRON- may know something about what be go on with -PRON- body too almost with the same dynamic -PRON- would treat another doctor
-PRON- feel more like a team effort rather_than a typical doctor\/patient dynamic
-PRON- be completely humble
this be really impressive to -PRON- because although -PRON- do_not have as much medical knowledge -PRON- be very in tune with -PRON- body and -PRON- can give legitimate hint as to what -PRON- think the issue may or may not be and -PRON- treat -PRON- input as just as valuable
-PRON- believe dr. battersby be what doctor should be -PRON- have a loving heart and everything -PRON- do and say be out of compassion and care
this be what will truly heal people
so grateful -PRON- find -PRON-

but -PRON- do_not_mind
-PRON- pick an empty booth next to the dance_floor

-PRON- refuse to move
so fabio come_out be disrespectful and rude
-PRON- clear -PRON- empty and full drink off the table
and tell -PRON- to get out the booth
-PRON- guess 6 black woman do_not fit the image of the club
thank to the promoter for apologize for -PRON- behavior
first last_visit
-PRON- trust a review_on_yelp that say this_place be flexible with vegan_option which be important to -PRON- daughter
yelp be mistaken
there are no vegan
option
here except garlicky french_fry and bread
the waitress offer nothing by way of create anything -PRON- daughter could eat save for a salad or remove the meat from skewer dish
call to make a reservation be difficult as -PRON- be ask to hold the line for 5_minute at a time and then hang_up_on
twice
table service be slow have to repeatedly ask for part of order that have be forget include the bread which be half -PRON- daughter 's meal
the fish -PRON- eat be well_prepared and tasty but all in all this be not a pleasant eat experience for -PRON- and -PRON- family
-PRON- have be order from rosati 's for about a month now

-PRON- guess the hype raise expectation
first -PRON- be 4_people and the waitress give -PRON- one cracker for the table
there be no king_crab which be weird since so_many review mention -PRON-
if -PRON- be not available -PRON- maybe should let -PRON- know in_advance
the snow crab be serve ice cold
-PRON- much prefer -PRON- hot
everything_else -PRON- try be good and the lamb chop be really good but a chocolate mousse pastry be awful
so if -PRON- do_not have great expectation -PRON- can stuff -PRON- silly for $ 37 which be not bad for vegas
fantastic food decent draft_beer
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- be there on a friday for the live band dress in lederhosen

decor attitude of the staff and the food and booze mean -PRON- be an instant hit
the baja fish_taco be a winner but the portion be small so order up more because the wait can get long

der seltsamste mediamarkt in dem ich bis jetzt war
sehr verwinkelt auf viele stockwerke verteilt wirkt unsortiert und man muss glück haben wenn man man genau das findet be man sucht
zum einfachen stöbern lohnt sich der laden nicht da macht ein
gang zum nicht viel weiter
entfernten schwestergeschäft saturn durchaus sinn
the pho with raw meat on_top be really good

this be not a restaurant -PRON- would put effort to make_reservation to
-PRON- would give -PRON- a 3.5_star if there be an option
so -PRON- order a pizza and -PRON- always ask for ranch and -PRON- never ever bring -PRON- the ranch that -PRON- have to pay for
not only do the pizza take 1_hour to get there but -PRON- never bring -PRON- the ranch

-PRON- be a sucker for all baked good and coffee and this_place be open and busy at all hour so -PRON- be a perfect spot after a concert
-PRON- have never be here at a time that there be not a line stretch the entire building
-PRON- be not ideal for someone in a hurry but if -PRON- can afford to wait in line -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- have yet to try anything that -PRON- do_not like
the tart be wonderful and -PRON- do_not_know anywhere_else to get french macaron
-PRON- have read other_review that suggest the french macaron be too tough or hard -PRON- have a perfectly crisp outer layer and spongy interior
the eclair be excellent as_well
-PRON- love croissant and these do_not_disappoint
one downside the price of the pastry and bake good
a bite sized tart run $ 2.50 and a 4 inch tart be $_4.50
macaron be $ 2.50 per cookie
the coffee and tea be great and very reasonably_price much cheap_than starbucks and a little cheap_than many_other cafe
the barista be quick and prepare the coffee well
the menu food be decent as_well
-PRON- be not what -PRON- come_here for though
the only other negative be that the service be much_less friendly than the typical cafe
the employee be so concerned with move the line quickly that -PRON- get snippy if -PRON- have a question especially about flavor or price of item that be not label
but -PRON- suppose if -PRON- take time to be friendly the wait time would be much long and -PRON- would lose business
for friendly service and a smile -PRON- will stick with -PRON- small local cafe
good indian_food -PRON- have ever have in_toronto

during the day -PRON- be definitely kid friendly
-PRON- food be pretty_good especially -PRON- late menu
pretty disappointed simply meh
-PRON- be close to -PRON- new work so give -PRON- a try
lack of taste overall
-PRON- would say -PRON- ingredient be pretty fresh but the execution of combine the sauce and the ingredient need serious work
-PRON- try combo appetizer pad_thai and pad_see_ew pretty common thai dish
a word of advice esp for a guy with normal appetite don't go there hungry
or make_sure -PRON- do_not order -PRON- lunch_special
the portion be really small and -PRON- will most_likely leave there hungry
even with $_12 combo app + pad_see_ew lunch -PRON- be so unsatisfied
quantitatively and qualitatively speak
and do_not think -PRON- be a huge samoan or something
-PRON- be not a big guy
any mean 5'9 150 lb
the service be prompt and friendly tho
-PRON- be just glad -PRON- can find good thai_restaurant near where -PRON- live
and with good price too

-PRON- have visit here on a couple of occasion only as -PRON- be not really in -PRON- neighbourhood
but -PRON- happen to be in the area
-PRON- be generally not fond of club in the basement where there be no natural light but this gym do_not seem that confine as the facility be well spaced and the layout be good
the only odd area be the stretch area which be a_bit raise up a couple of step and off to one side
there be enough cardio machine when -PRON- be there during rush hour one time
but not all of -PRON- have a clear view of the hanging tv screen as there be structural pillar that block angle
so -PRON- need to move around to find a treadmill with an unobstructed view
-PRON- find most goodlife club have very good front line staff which be often underrated as this really reflect on the business since initial impression be important in this industry
this club be no different as -PRON- be very_friendly and helpful on -PRON- first_visit
so -PRON- make an effort to return on another occasion when -PRON- be in the area
the change room be clean and there be enough equipment in both the free weight universal machine and cardio
-PRON- do_not have the fancy stuff that the liberty village location have and do_not quite match the ambiance either since -PRON- be underground
but -PRON- get a 4_star rating for facility
after buy a new house -PRON- wife and -PRON- need a_few fan
in -PRON- previous home -PRON- have a fan -PRON- purchase there that last 9 year
know that fanco be the place to go for quality ceiling fan -PRON- come in to take a look
-PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- want but the staff be very patient with -PRON-
after two visit the second be multiple hour -PRON- finally find a fan dining table chandelier and 3 pendant light that all match
-PRON- make a bold decision and could_not be happy
fanco staff be awesome and the equipment be all great quality
-PRON- be very happy
the location be desirable but the outside and inside of the restaurant be very modern and nice
the food be awesome and very affordable
-PRON- have the fry_rice and the beef soup bowl
so good
-PRON- demolish -PRON-
love the spiked shake
extra shot be only $_3 for the shake
have the golden burger which be delicious
unlike so_many of the relatively new restaurant rave and review kindred most certainly live_up to -PRON- reputation
-PRON- have wonder for some time if the drive from charlotte would be worth fight the i-77 traffic to try a new place that may be like so_many of the other high profile place that do_not live_up to -PRON- hype
-PRON- reluctance be quickly put to ease the milk bread arrive and disappear in a hurry
-PRON- all state if the rest_of the meal be as good as the bread -PRON- be in for a treat
-PRON- order -PRON- eat
-PRON- order again -PRON- eat again
this keep on until -PRON- all vow -PRON- could_not possibly hold another bite
want to bypass dessert the waiter state if -PRON- like the milk bread so_much -PRON- should at_least split a milk bread cinnamon_roll
thank_goodness -PRON- do
perfect end to a perfect meal
the drive be worth -PRON- and -PRON- will be back
what be not to love
just can be a little over crowded wish -PRON- have to store front
try this_place on a whim
-PRON- would never have cajun food before
and -PRON- be curious
the restaurant be cute
the decor have a louisiana summer night on the porch vibe
-PRON- go with the crab landry a crab stew serve on_top_of garlic_bread with fry shrimp on_top
the shrimp be outstanding
the stew be hearty and warm
the sweet_tea be also really good
not too_sweet at all
-PRON- be a_bit of a wait to get seat but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- will certainly be back
no lines and life
by design be very attractive inside with beautifully decorate room and the wait area be comfortable and invite
kim be a very_knowledgeable nurse practitioner who do a thorough exam and give -PRON- an extensive questionnaire to complete so -PRON- can get a true idea of -PRON- health and where to pinpoint what -PRON- need to work on and be help first
-PRON- be very caring and understanding of -PRON- individual need and set -PRON- up on a proper nutritional program with the correct supplement after blood work and saliva sample that reflect more accurately -PRON- hormone function
not only do -PRON- help fix -PRON- esthetic imperfections\/insecuritie but -PRON- help fix -PRON- from the inside out
-PRON- have have microneedl facial mask dysport for -PRON- wrinkle and -PRON- have use -PRON- medical grade sauna which be very relaxing and rejuvenating feeling after
-PRON- be go to have resurfx treatment soon
-PRON- offer a ton_of other treatment option that be available on -PRON- website
-PRON- should check -PRON- out
-PRON- could_not have be happy with the service
although the ding in -PRON- hood could_not be repair because the hood be aluminum jeff touch up the paint and also buff another spot on the fender
no charge
wow
-PRON- think that the one_star review must have be write by the competition or someone have company mix up
this be a nice hotel centrally_locate and within walking_distance of everything
the staff be kind and very_helpful include the valet
-PRON- only problem with this hotel be the bartender every_time -PRON- ride to get a drink this one bartender short and a red beard would pas -PRON- by at_least 3 time to serve other
-PRON- may not dress like an executive but -PRON- have money too and to be look over like that constantly be an insult
-PRON- recommend stay_at this hotel
but -PRON- highly_recommend go_somewhere_else for drink
what a douche
amazing donut
the people run the place be very courteous
-PRON- know -PRON- will be here again and again
the bagel sandwich be also top_notch
-PRON- bet a lot_of curse word be say in this parking_lot
parking be a nightmare here
well unless -PRON- be like -PRON- and go at 2:30pm
but even when the small parking_lot be not full -PRON- be super awkward get in and out of -PRON-
the worker be nice
small location but nice and quiet to bring -PRON- laptop and get some work do
a typical visit here -PRON- will see a lot_of myers park mom
see a mp dad for the first_time today
hello nurse
-PRON- be starbucks
no big surprise here
-PRON- pretty_much know_what -PRON- be go to get
if the parking_lot if full head on up the street to the new teeter
-PRON- have a starbucks inside
if there be a way to give a place negative_star -PRON- would
-PRON- be tell by a friend when -PRON- move out here that these salon have the dumb staff_member around but other_than_that be good salon
-PRON- could_not have be more correct
-PRON- have never meet a group_of more incompetent unprofessional people in -PRON- life
-PRON- pay for the vip all inclusive membership so that -PRON- can tan whenever -PRON- want in whatev bed or use any service that -PRON- want
this membership be $_100
not cheap
-PRON- have an_issue with freeze -PRON- account that have take -PRON- nearly two month to get clear up have not be able_to tan although -PRON- be continue to pay -PRON- monthly membership and then have a bunch_of mystery fee 's $_75 worth that no one seem to know anything about on -PRON- account
each and every_time -PRON- go in -PRON- speak with a new employee who be just as baffle as the one before never receive any help
the girl that work there be virtually useless by no fault of -PRON- own because -PRON- be not allow to view and\/or correct any error or make any change to account without a manager 's help
-PRON- suggest that -PRON- call corporate although -PRON- be tell by more_than one of the employee that -PRON- probably will not answer or call back because -PRON- will not even call -PRON- employee back to help -PRON- with issue
that be extremely accurate
-PRON- call four time and leave message because the phone just ring off the hook and no one answer and no one
ever call -PRON- back
finally one girl get a hold of -PRON- manager on -PRON- cell_phone and -PRON- speak to -PRON- and have never have a more disrespectful bitch on the other line in -PRON- life
-PRON- name be raina and -PRON- be beyond unprofessional
not only do -PRON- cut me off with every sentence -PRON- try to get out but -PRON- then_proceed to hang_up_on -PRON-
since then -PRON- be apparently
demote nothing to do with -PRON-
so -PRON- probably do the same to more_than one person but in -PRON- opinion -PRON- should be fire and never hire anywhere_else ever again as -PRON- clearly have neither proper customer_service_skill nor common sense
-PRON- contact bbb and specifically report her along_with -PRON- complaint
-PRON- deserve a slap in the face
good bed but -PRON- will have to figure_out how to use -PRON- completely on -PRON- own because the girl will sit_at the front_desk on -PRON- cell_phone and no one will show -PRON- what to do
-PRON- be good off in the sun
would not recommend_this_place to anyone
so that be porchetta
how do one review eat greasy pig body part in a bun
easy like this
have -PRON- ever want to feel_like a pig for half_an_hour
well come to porchetta and -PRON- will
first -PRON- get in line like a pig wait to be slaughter as -PRON- shuffle forward inch by inch get close to the door -PRON- become overwhelmed by the sweet smell of sweaty savory swine -PRON- be undeniable
how good pork smell
but -PRON- be also undeniable how good pork taste in -PRON- mouth
the staff be nice -PRON- order the fry_chicken sandwich with bacon
-PRON- be fantastic
but -PRON- be sure -PRON- would have taste better if -PRON- could have
oh -PRON- do_not_know
sat down
to eat it
because of the small tight close in environment with the heat really tie everything together
all this_place need be an actual troff to feed -PRON- be customer and the feel_like a pig experience would have be complete oh the sparkle orange_juice suck
note
-place be clean
-staff be nice
-food be good with nice portion_size -food be hot temperature
-little to no seating suck and really make eat uncomfortable -a little messy but fun -PRON- would come_back
when -PRON- walk_in -PRON- see just a coffee shop but behind what look_like a barista station -PRON- create wonderful food
friendly service owner come by to ask if all be well love that
-PRON- have the central park breakfast and an order of banana nut pancak
egg be great bacon crispy and 9 grain whole wheat toast which -PRON- can perchase a loaf be fantastic
the good thing though be the banana nut pancak
can_not wait to go_back for lunch and dinner

because the tree and pricing may be different out here
-PRON- go online to ask for tree removal\/trimm quote
four place call -PRON- to set_up quote appointment

when jerry call with -PRON- quote -PRON- be very clear about the fact_that -PRON- want other quote and the guy be understand and very_nice
-PRON- say that another company be already schedule out a_few day_later and that -PRON- would have to wait to hear back from -PRON-
again -PRON- totally understand and be appreciative of -PRON- communication of that
jerry call back the next_day to tell -PRON- that -PRON- have two other job schedule near -PRON- house the follow day and would -PRON- consider have -PRON- come_out and do the job
jerry come down more on the quote and -PRON- be too good to turn down
-PRON- ask how long -PRON- would take to remove one giant overgrown and double twisted palo verde tree grind out the stump and also to trim back the mesquite tree which probably have never be professionally trim + all debris removal
-PRON- be a big job
jerry say that -PRON- would take two hour and say that -PRON- guy would be there at_11_a.m. if that be okay with -PRON-
-PRON- say that -PRON- do_not want to be pushy but -PRON- want the job and know -PRON- would all save money
-PRON- do
-PRON- call -PRON- husband to confer and -PRON- agree -PRON- should go_ahead and do -PRON- because at that time one of the other company have already drive_by and give -PRON- a write a quote that be $_100 high_than jerry 's
-PRON- be a no brainer
so -PRON- call jerry right back
and -PRON- schedule for the next_morning
jerry 's guy show_up two minute early yay and the job be finish in one hour on the dot
unbelievable
-PRON- would never have know that the palo verde tree have be there
the mesquite tree look amazing and the yard be spotless no debris
-PRON- could hardly believe -PRON-
-PRON- love -PRON-
payment be so casual -PRON- simply call jerry to tell -PRON- the job be do and -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- payment over the phone
-PRON- be that simple
jerry answer some question -PRON- have about drip\/irrigation tubing and then -PRON- also recommend whittier tree farm over on southern in case -PRON- want to replace the tree -PRON- have remove
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would get a discount there for mention -PRON- name
-PRON- will call back next_year to have -PRON- do all of -PRON- tree
great experience
zero stars
with in 10 second of sit_down 2 yes two
cockroach
stay_away
-PRON- be rare that -PRON- have a date with -PRON- husband on a monday afternoon\/even but this past memorial day -PRON- do just that
after a quick visit to the science center the van gogh alive exhibit be a must see by the way -PRON- be hungry
so -PRON- head over to rice paper
neither of -PRON- have ever be before and -PRON- be pleased_with -PRON- experience
-PRON- be a tad bit too hot to sit_outside although -PRON- do have a cover patio with mister
-PRON- walk_in and be seat and greet promptly by al -PRON- server
-PRON- be quite the character
-PRON- make -PRON- laugh quite a_bit in_addition to be attentive and make some recommendation
-PRON- enjoy the stylish renovated house hip colorful atmosphere as_well
-PRON- end_up order a_few thing and sharing
highlights include the firecracker shrimp
a spider roll a shrimp roll and a zen salad
everything be light and taste fresh
-PRON- really_enjoy the dipping_sauce that come with the spring_roll
-PRON- have get such a huge_selection of the spring_roll that -PRON- can_not wait to return to try some of the other
-PRON- do_not have a huge_selection of vietnamese entree but -PRON- appear that -PRON- will custom create a_bit upon request
-PRON- highly_recommend go for the food happy_hour
-PRON- be from 3 p.m. 6:30pm and include $_6 appetizer $_1 off all spring_roll
such a deal
-PRON- do_not take_advantage_of -PRON- but the drink happy_hour be actually 11_a.m. 6:30pm and specialty drink be $_6 house wine by the glass be $_5 well drink be $_4 and draft_beer be just $ 2.75
if only rice paper be a tad bit closer to home -PRON- could see -PRON- be a regular
instead -PRON- will keep -PRON- high on -PRON- list of spot to return to when -PRON- find -PRON- head downtown
love everybody there
so encouraging and helpful and all have different story and goal that anyone could relate to
this be a must see
very low_key and retro
as the other_review have mention -PRON- be tacky but -PRON- be a fun tacky
the analogy to a limo be spot on
-PRON- be relax watch music video 's by the bubble fire pit while sip some good drink at a good value
-PRON- also agree with the comment that this would be a good place to eat after go on a bender
-PRON- have an egg skillet that be huge and delicious with spicy sausage
-PRON- almost remind -PRON- of a garbage plate in a good way
great service
make a delivery order
due_to an_issue with the delivery person the manager bring -PRON-
food be excellent
base_on another review -PRON- order the gyro sandwich
great choice
not_sure when -PRON- may ever be back in pittsburgh so -PRON- be glad -PRON- be able order food from scoop and more
in -PRON- opinion the three most_important criterion to evaluate a restaurant be 1 cleanliness of the place and the food 2
deliciousness of the food 3
politeness of staff reyan restaurant score 5\/5 on all three
that be why -PRON- be give the restaurant 5_star
for someone_who care_about the ambiance a lot one would probably have to subtract between 1 and 1.5 star but -PRON- always leave this restaurant so happy and pleased the ambiance do_not_matter to -PRON-
1
the gentleman_who run this_place respect -PRON- customer in two way keep the place clean for -PRON- and choose the good ingredient in prepare -PRON- food
if -PRON- go to the washroom for_example -PRON- may be able_to find some area of chip off paint on the wall but -PRON- will not find a speck of dirt
-PRON- be always clean so thoroughly as if an honour guest be about to come to use -PRON-
with regard to the food -PRON- will use the shawarma to make -PRON- point
-PRON- have order both arabic chicken shawarma and arabic beef shawarma in the past from reyan with a preference for the latter and -PRON- eat the little gourmet sandwich with confidence and without unwrap -PRON- to check the ingredient
in most restaurant that serve shawarma -PRON- order -PRON- on a plate rather_than on a sandwich because -PRON- shawarma involve disgusting bit of skin and chunk of fat which -PRON- consider a sign of great disrespect for customer
at reyan restaurant that be not the case
-PRON- get serve the good cut of meat and -PRON- food be make with premium ingredient
2
at reyan -PRON- have learn that -PRON- do_not have to order shawarma every_time -PRON- go to a middle_eastern restaurant but instead open -PRON- horizon and try the non fast_food item
whatev -PRON- have try -PRON- have be so happy and please with
the lamb here be spectacular so delicious and tender
-PRON- have try lamb with freekeh lamb with rice and mansaf jamid
-PRON- love -PRON- all but -PRON- will mention that the mansaf jamid be serve with jamid which taste_like a derivative of yogurt so if -PRON- be not a fan_of yogurt -PRON- will want to go for the first two instead
otherwise try the mansaf and explore new flavour
-PRON- have also order yabrak stuff grape leave with a_few other side and malfoof stuff cabbage leave
these be the best stuff grape leaf -PRON- have have in a restaurant
-PRON- like -PRON- both but have a slight preference for the cabbage one
another favourite of mine be basmashkat
-PRON- consist_of a tender thin slice of beef stuff with rice and ground beef and be serve with mash_potato and a flavourful tomato base stew
at serve time the chef come to remove the thread that hold the beef while cook
so -PRON- do_not have to worry_about eat -PRON-
-PRON- have also try a_few other item and have be pleasantly surprise but hope to get the courage to try more new meal
the food be so clean and delicious and make -PRON- feel comfy -PRON- be eat -PRON-
3
lastly the gentleman_who run this_place be extremely polite and courteous which add to the enjoyment of the food
great bartender and service
order take out and the food be excellent

also -PRON- purple haze martini be superb
-PRON- only need one which be shocking for -PRON-
-PRON- be usually a two drink girl
a must return
-PRON- be not go to lie but -PRON- love hallmark
-PRON- have everything sentimental that -PRON- need or_whatev -PRON- be look for
-PRON- be sure -PRON- have -PRON- card"wise
-PRON- be a sucker when -PRON- come to good card
and -PRON- have never have a problem find the perfect card
the wrapping paper and bag be pretty dang awesome as_well
-PRON- have knick knack that can be collectible which be great for mom_'s aunt 's grandma 's etc
all of these thing can add up but -PRON- well_worth -PRON- for someone that be sappy like -PRON-
wow
when -PRON- think of crepe -PRON- think of fruit and syrup and the like -PRON- do_not think of egg and stuff fold into a crepe
-PRON- have the 8 a.m. which be egg sausage cheese pepper and onion fold into a crepe
-PRON- be delish
-PRON- have a simple coffee which be good but next_time -PRON- will try the specialty coffee of which -PRON- have plenty
also when -PRON- come_back -PRON- will have to try some of sweet crepe too

-PRON- hang two 75 inch tv_'s pretty high since -PRON- have tall ceiling and -PRON- even reuse an_old mount so -PRON- be able_to return one which save -PRON- a little money

thank -PRON- for be a part of -PRON- wonderful -PRON- time
okra be a very interesting place -PRON- find okra from yelp
but -PRON- do_not think the food category of southern food and italian food be true to what -PRON- see
on the menu -PRON- feel that -PRON- be new twist to southern home cooking but nothing close to italian cuisine
okra have a wonderful ambience quiet and relaxing and -PRON- have a beautiful patio and full bar
-PRON- enjoy okra but nothing -PRON- have be super enough to go_back
take -PRON- son to get -PRON- haircut and destiny be great
-PRON- be polite and very_professional

5_star all in all
love everything about this_place
3.5_star
-PRON- come with a large_group of about 20 people for a birthday party
this_place probably seat about 40 or so so -PRON- take up pretty_much half the restaurant
a great place for korean fry_chicken
-PRON- can order half or full portion in either boneless or bone in
-PRON- husband
and -PRON- order two plate of the boneless with spicy korean sauce on the side and a side of curly_fry
-PRON- husband also have a beer
come to $ 64 total include_tax and tip
the atmosphere be casual pub style with dim lighting
the waiter try -PRON- good to get -PRON- order out on time but have miss a couple of thing such_as -PRON- friend meal and -PRON- curly_fry which require a_few reminder
-PRON- think this_place would have deserve another star if the service be more organized and efficient
-PRON- do give -PRON- $_2 off for some_reason possibly due_to the delay with -PRON- food
the chicken -PRON- be delicious and the sauce be very_tasty
there be lot_of different flavour available and other side_dish too
the curly_fry be all break into piece and be not that great
-PRON- be $ 7.99 and not worth -PRON-
another_reviewer mention that -PRON- be not as good as arby 's and that be exactly_what -PRON- have think as_well
also have a taste of the onion_ring
-PRON- be batter thin and taste okay but again not really worth -PRON-
-PRON- hear good thing_about the cheese buldak
but -PRON- do_not get to try -PRON-
highly_recommend the chicken though and hopefully the service would be good with a small group
great authentic food
great place
and truly -PRON- be impressed_by the up to date and clean restroom

there service be friendly and very_knowledgeable
do_not order from this_company
-PRON- order tire over 3_week ago and have no receive -PRON- or be able_to contact anyone at the company
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give -PRON- negative_star
mid century modern light fixture rich red leather booth dim lighting and television show classic black and white film from the 40 and 50s- siegel 's try and mostly succeed at establish a classy retro atmosphere
the menu encompass breakfast and dinner special a series of sandwich of the world and a $ 19.41 steak dinner which make siegel 's not what -PRON- expect
the atmosphere be gear more toward a steakhouse but be instead utilize as a diner
the $ 19.41 steak dinner include a salad head up the house vinaigrette be a creamy version slice sirloin serve top with steak sauce usually not something -PRON- like but nicely zesty here heap of fresh fry and a bread plate which never materialize
the tuesday dinner special be a country fry_steak with mash_potato and vegetable which be generously sized and solid for the low $_11 price_tag
-PRON- could_not resist add on a bowl of -PRON- matzoh ball soup with challah which be surprisingly meaty for $_8
-PRON- want to share a dessert but upon ask to see the menu -PRON- be hand -PRON- bill- guess that make the decision for -PRON- huh
unfortunately the subpar service kind_of ruin -PRON- for -PRON-
regulars be enthusiastically greet and -PRON- be help in a polite and competent manner but odd delay 20_minute between course 10 to run -PRON- card the dessert thing make thing a_bit frustrating
the location and decor lend this space the potential to be a high_end restaurant if -PRON- kick up the menu and retrain the staff
third_time at this restaurant and always walk_out the door hop the next_time be soon
-PRON- live in chicago
food be fresh and inventive
every dish -PRON- have be mouthwater
do_not be fool by the location
great italian food

adela be a great server
slow slow slow service
the food be good for -PRON- -PRON- husband filet be tough so -PRON- do_not like -PRON-
kids like -PRON- food but wait 45 for the main_course be a big turn_off for -PRON-
this mc donald 's be the bad one -PRON- ever be to
when -PRON- be order 6 mc nugget and a split mc ice_cream the people give -PRON- 7 mc nugget and -PRON- ask for six -PRON- be so mad and for splitting the ice_cream -PRON- just get another cup because -PRON- be too hard for -PRON-
last -PRON- table be fill with mc pick 2s

-PRON- think get there be the hard part
the shopping centre be huge

whenever -PRON- find something -PRON- like -PRON- be meet with disappointment

tut mir leid aber außer dem schönen
blick kann mich da
so schnell nicht wieder hinziehen
übrigen der service ist stylish aber schnell überfordert

ummm so
this_place be -PRON- jam
-PRON- first encounter tupelo at -PRON- original spot in downtown asheville
-PRON- could tell -PRON- what all be good with detail but honestly everything -PRON- have ever have here be flippin fantastic
-PRON- be talk waddle out the door with a food baby good
-PRON- have take a couple group_of folk here and -PRON- have all thoroughly_enjoy -PRON- as_well
this could be a great place to introduce out of towner to southern cuisine be that -PRON- have some classic along_with some modern interpretation
tupelo be a local spot and honor seasonal food which mean the menu be always change and the food be always fresh
in essence + amazing food
local fresh seasonal + fun cozy atmosphere + friendly_staff + great pricing + group friendly\/good for visitor -park challenge at time but at_least -PRON- be free
-PRON- love have a place so close where -PRON- can easily pick_up a pizza or go to for a casual date_night without have to drive too_far
the food have be very consistent
the only_thing -PRON- do_not understand be -PRON- feel_like there be always so_many employee and for the most_part -PRON- all just stand around while 1 person do all the work
however the 1 person do all the work be always very_friendly and -PRON- have have very good experience here
-PRON- have eat_here_twice
-PRON- appreciate somewhere where -PRON- can go and get a meal with some green vegetable that be more_than just the garnish and also have some vegan_option
-PRON- first meal -PRON- get a rice bowl and -PRON- enjoy that although -PRON- be a little spicy or than -PRON- have expect
-PRON- realize the description say spicy garlic
but -PRON- assume the spicy mean the garlic and not the red chili pepper that be also in there
-PRON- keep read about the thyme fry so and -PRON- second_visit -PRON- decide to take the leap and order the fry which be rare for -PRON-
-PRON- also order the peanut bowl gluten_free option
the fry be a huge_disappointment
-PRON- order -PRON- as a treat -PRON- eat fry once or twice a year
-PRON- have_no_idea what be so special about these fry
there be never a hint_of thyme flavor and -PRON- be certainly be not visually observable
-PRON- be just regular fry nothing_special at all a little greasy and -PRON- ketchup taste weird
the peanut bowl be okay
-PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- be fake chicken be deep_fry
in -PRON- opinion -PRON- a wash as_far as vegan chicken that be fry vs regular chicken_breast as long as -PRON- raise properly
if -PRON- return to the area in the future -PRON- may stop in
but -PRON- think there be very little on the menu for -PRON-
and if -PRON- want to stick with healthy food -PRON- need to order carefully here
the food arrive super_fast a little too fast as -PRON- like to wash -PRON- hand before -PRON- eat
-PRON- have no sooner order and get some water and the fry be on the table
the cashier be friendly and helpful when -PRON- be order
one of the few place in champaign to test -PRON- palette
next to cafe luna i would say this be the perfect place to escape for excellent wine food and dessert
thad be serious about -PRON- menu and -PRON- feel -PRON- when -PRON- experience -PRON- creation
libby always recommend the absolute perfect wine for every course
don't even_bother try to compete with -PRON- pair knowledge
the food be rather smart and inventive
the interior be very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago
as_usual huge line just to get past the two lady gate keep even_though there be not much go on in the actual room
-PRON- do_not help to have several super slow people do eye exam at the same time four of -PRON- have now tie up one of the two rep for 15_minute
if -PRON- be that slow take a 20 second eye test -PRON- probably should not drive to begin with
there must be a good way to triage this what -PRON- have now clearly do_not work
but probably no one really care
back a few_month later
the two slow move gate keeper lady be still there and the line be even long
between -PRON- take photograph and do eye test no wonder -PRON- move so slowly
where -PRON- heart live
so_much to offer
such a wonderful place to grow_up
after move to chicago -PRON- realize -PRON- miss the cheese the beer and the hippie
moi et ma copine y somme allés hier

ma première expérience en musique électronique fût en début 2000 dan le fameux film allemand cours lola cour
depuis cette musique a évoluée
or nous étion immergé par cette musique tout au long de cet événement
comme lorsque je visite
le mac j'aime comme m'explique les oeuvre car je ne suis pas féru d'art
j'aurai aimé qu'on m'explique les oeuvre numérique
l'événement commençait à 21hr et trente minute plus tard l'activité principale n'était pas commencée
nous_avon quitté
je n'aime pa être passif et ne pas comprendre
je vai prendre le temp de lire aujourd'hui le programme
stop in here after an experience in the escape room across the street
how convenient -PRON- be to just cross the street to hough 's for dinner and drink
hough 's be a decently sized bar and restaurant with a huge beer menu and food menu consist mostly of sandwich and homemade pierogis
-PRON- order the chicken and waffle sandwich and -PRON- be legit
honestly this may be the good way to have chicken and waffle
-PRON- get tater_tot with the sandwich and the portion_size be humongous
-PRON- be a fan_of hough 's for -PRON- chicken and waffle sandwich alone but the huge_selection of beer be definitely a plus
this_place be so good
-PRON- live in california and every_time -PRON- come to vegas -PRON- have to stop here and grab a_few goody and before -PRON- head back home
-PRON- have a_few text from -PRON- family_member to stop and pick a_few more goody for -PRON- as_well
excellent place
so delicious first_time today the service be so bad
the lady with the butterfly tattoo on -PRON- right forearm need to be train on people skill\/customer service
when -PRON- be pick out the goody -PRON- be like anything_else anything_else anything_else with this look_like -PRON- be bother
make -PRON- feel very very uncomfortable
harbor inn have be around forever and be a must stop place in cleveland
-PRON- have spend many a drunk hour in this_place over the year
and -PRON- should really be drink heavily to be able_to ignore the layer of dirt over everything
after a_few drink -PRON- just become part of the ambiance
-PRON- never know who -PRON- may run into here
retiree blue collar worker get off of a shift teacher nun local celebrity
food be bland
order carne_asada taco and meat be so bland
-PRON- think -PRON- be chicken
-PRON- argue_with -PRON- and say -PRON- be carne_asada
so -PRON- reluctantly eat 3 more bite and pack -PRON- up to go
husband order red chilli burrito
-PRON- be just mush and mediocre flavor
staff be awkward not real friendly
seem bored to be there
will not go_back =
-PRON- be disappointed in this business
at first -PRON- have high_expectation mainly from speak with joe about move -PRON- upright piano down one story 2nd floor condo down to ground and into -PRON- rental move truck
-PRON- explain_how -PRON- move piano and the price be reasonable -PRON- charge -PRON- $_200
-PRON- and -PRON- partner do move -PRON- piano down to the ground successfully
this be last friday 4\/3\/2015
what -PRON- be not happy about be the following 1
-PRON- call -PRON- at 9:25am to say -PRON- should arrive at -PRON- place in a few_minute
2 -PRON- text -PRON- at 9:40am to say -PRON- forget something and have to go_back
in -PRON- experience as a professional one do_not forget something that be important in do one 's job
3 -PRON- be wait on joe to arrive because -PRON- could_not finish load up -PRON- rental truck until after the piano be in the truck
4 -PRON- finally arrive just before 11_a.m.
-PRON- pay -PRON- cash mistake and forget to get a receipt from -PRON- to claim move expense
-PRON- even tip -PRON- and -PRON- partner
mistake
-PRON- text -PRON- an_hour after -PRON- leave ask for a receipt
no answer
5 -PRON- have still not receive a response
-PRON- leave 2 voicemail and 1 email over the past week and nothing
-PRON- just try call -PRON- again 5_minute ago but -PRON- voice mailbox be full
not professional
joe if -PRON- read this -PRON- be happy to revise this review pend acknowledgement of -PRON- attempt to contact -PRON- and a receipt
when -PRON- pay for service -PRON- expect professionalism just as -PRON- do in -PRON- own dealing as a freelance pianist and teacher
move the piano be one thing but a simple text or phone_call back be huge and generate a lot_of goodwill
awesome food and super_friendly staff
check_out what fellow_yelper have to say about sophia 's and all sound pretty great
so -PRON- stop in and give -PRON- a try
so -PRON- will just say -PRON- do think this_place be a_bit disorganized as to the placement of everything and the whole process of ordering seating and get -PRON- drink
walk_in and there be a huge line people just kinda stand everywhere
once -PRON- walk_in -PRON- realize how tiny of a restaurant -PRON- be
but -PRON- be cozy love the interior
while -PRON- be wait in line -PRON- can look up on to the wall at the menu to try and decide on what -PRON- want from all the amazing sound choice
once to the counter -PRON- put -PRON- order in and then the wait continue
there be approximately 4 table and one little bar_area with stool along the window
and when -PRON- be there at a 11:30 on a sunday_morning -PRON- can_imagine the wait -PRON- have
and when -PRON- say this_place be tiny -PRON- be tiny
there be really no good place to stand while people be try to grab -PRON- coffee or water or go to the bathroom or put -PRON- dish away
once -PRON- finally get to table -PRON- put -PRON- name in and take in the atmosphere a_bit_more
-PRON- will say
-PRON- think -PRON- be a pretty neat idea to have group tables so -PRON- be sit with stranger and get to make some good conversation with someone new
once -PRON- food come -PRON- be pleased_with the presentation of -PRON- meal
-PRON- end_up get the grandma 's sweet cheese blintzes and
oh_my where -PRON- good
a_bit different -PRON- could_not pin point what -PRON- remind -PRON- of
but the sweet yet sour\/bitter filling and the light syrup on_top all pair so well
-PRON- be sad to say that -PRON- be not very_impressed_with -PRON- visit to this_location
the food be just bland
-PRON- feel and taste as if -PRON- have be sit out for hour before -PRON- arrive
sadly -PRON- decide to try this_place after the quality of the food at the whataburger near central and mcdowell seem to be go downhill
whataburger use to be one of -PRON- favorite fast_food place but with the food at two location be less_than satisfactory -PRON- be hesitant to return
on the plus side the employee at this particular restaurant at 1346 s rural rd be friendly and the establishment be clean
-PRON- should really give big bang a four out of ten because -PRON- be be too_crowded to find a seat and sometimes even a place to stand several_time -PRON- have be there
-PRON- have to give -PRON- a five though because when -PRON- can find some space -PRON- be just too_much fun
the performer be unbelievable and -PRON- be guarantee to have a good night then at a traditional club\/bar
-PRON- buy a really fun and huge specialty drink with five straw that be plenty for five of -PRON- to share for $_20
so price be fair
-PRON- just love -PRON-
-PRON- recommend go much early right around 8 when -PRON- open to secure a comfortable table for the night
awesome omelet make to order all day long
-PRON- share a veggie and the ingredient be fresh home cook tasty and probably organic
coffee be pip_hot and sport that dark and deep roasted ambiance which perfectly complement the omelet
and all for under_$ 10
owner lack customer_service
-PRON- be often in the shop make sub and be absolutely terrible at -PRON-
for_example -PRON- baja chicken sub lack the baja sauce and include very little bacon
-PRON- will no_longer visit this_location
this_place be pretty_good but -PRON- be a_bit_more expensive than the other indian_restaurant on campus
the waiter be pretty nice but the take a while top give -PRON- the check
-PRON- just have the good bbq here at bobby q 's
-PRON- sample the brisket pork and pulled chicken
all be incredibly juicy and delicious
the bbq_sauce be great and not too_sweet
the cornbread be excellent
service be super_friendly and super quick
sadly -PRON- be only in the area for travel and can_not make this a new regular spot
-PRON- love this ranch
the view be breathtaking -PRON- guide be so knowledgeable_about the dessert plant and history of the area
-PRON- take -PRON- time until -PRON- get comfortable with the horse
-PRON- even jump off -PRON- horse tonto love the name and take some picture of -PRON-
-PRON- take the 2_hour ride and -PRON- be very peaceful and just a wonderful time
can_not wait to go_back
exceptional_customer_service
-PRON- stop in on a friday_night and the drive_thru look a_bit chaotic
want the tasty chicken_finger and delicious fry sauce -PRON- pull in away
the line move right along and all employee from whom ever take the order to the one give use the bounty be happy and highly personable
this particular day be very warm and -PRON- down -PRON- sweet_tea in a matter of second
the gentleman at the window be very kind to refill -PRON- cup with absolutely no attitude what so ever
the only challenge for -PRON- now that -PRON- be in the nw be to not stop_by here every_day
-PRON- have be come to dr. holland for a while now and have no_complaint
-PRON- parent refer -PRON- to -PRON-
and -PRON- be glad -PRON- do
very honest and take -PRON- time
-PRON- have a bunch_of fill that need to be do
-PRON- have a pretty tiny mouth so -PRON- get pretty tiring and painful to keep -PRON- mouth open for long period of time
-PRON- always let -PRON- -PRON- take a break whenever -PRON- need one
-PRON- previous dentist would always rush instead_of give -PRON- break so -PRON- filling would always fall out after a while
dr. holland do_not rush -PRON- work
so -PRON- know -PRON- be get do properly
do_not let the 2 low star reviewer stop -PRON- from come
dr. holland and -PRON- team be amazing
-PRON- wife and -PRON- purchase a puppy from this store a few_week_ago and upon bring the puppy home -PRON- notice -PRON- have persistent cough
-PRON- instantly have to research the store online only to find out -PRON- be a puppy mill
as much as -PRON- love the puppy and have sympathy for -PRON- -PRON- could_not go_through with the massive $ 2000 price_tag this include fee akc recovery fee dog food leash etc and the requirement to purchase only -PRON- dog food for two year in order to receive the limited warranty on puppy death\/ free replacement
-PRON- wife an -PRON- be disgust with the fact this puppy be from a puppy mill
so -PRON- research the contract to find out -PRON- have to pay a 50 restock_fee of 729 dollar if -PRON- return the dog
which be silly and outrageous however -PRON- would have be the less evil of the two to pay the restock_fee than to pay_$ 2000 plus vet bill
so -PRON- return the puppy and pay the restock_fee mind -PRON- -PRON- legal in arizona to charge up to 50 percent restock_fee and -PRON- say -PRON- would call the credit company and cancel the contract which -PRON- have not yet after a few_week
-PRON- receive bill for the payment for the $ 2000 plus dollar owe for the puppy even_though -PRON- have be return
-PRON- be still deal with -PRON- to get this take_care_of and -PRON- have be nothing but runaround in circle
-PRON- may explore the option of take -PRON- to court
-PRON- strongly recommend -PRON- do_not go to this store to purchase -PRON- puppy when there be good and more cheap alternative like humane society
cozy and eclectic hookah spot on the seasonally busy st. denis in december -PRON- be dead compare to the protest sized crowd in the summer
came in here after -PRON- usual 6_hour drive up from nj to relax a_bit with the lady
hookah be good and the service be ok -PRON- should probably pay more attention to the hot coal as mine and the guest around -PRON- all have burn out coal with a server that have no apparent rush to replace -PRON-
-PRON- lady mint tea be very good and pip_hot which actually annoy -PRON- when -PRON- taste -PRON- lukewarm cappuccino and due_to -PRON- exhaustion could care less at that point to complain
some night -PRON- close at 1_a.m. but -PRON- be in way past that to about half after and some people be seat around ten_minute to 1_a.m. if -PRON- think -PRON- be worth a shot stop in late_night
with some minor adjustment this_place could easily be a favorite an d somewhere -PRON- would_recommend to friend or on -PRON- blog www.travelingcoco.com
wow only a year and 1\/2 later same issues-
how many_time do -PRON- have to review these clown to get some change
chipotle corporate try to help to slight avail -the last 4 time -PRON- place order online
-PRON- have to wait another 10_15 min after the schedule pick_up time for -PRON- to be finish
plus to add insult to injury the store be empty every_single_time
order online be suppose to expedite lol- lord have mercy on these slow folk
last order -PRON- do_not add salsa to -PRON- burrito bowl nor do -PRON- have much rice even_tho -PRON- say -PRON- right on the receipt failx10
extremely slow service
there be one sushi chef
-PRON- be one of only 3 table and -PRON- take an insanely long_time
the fish be just ok
tuna be not very fresh
-PRON- be very very_nice though
-PRON- wish -PRON- could have give this zero_star
-PRON- co_worker and -PRON- go into the weary traveler the other day for lunch none_of -PRON- have ever be there
but -PRON- all hear relatively good thing of the place
when -PRON- first enter the initial shock be how cold the place be
-PRON- know that -PRON- be go_through the midst of the polar vortex this week but seriously there be very little difference in temperature from outside to inside
the service be average at good nothing to write_home_about except that -PRON- server appear to be very disheveled and possibly may have miss a shower or two or three
-PRON- food arrive again nothing_spectacular
but that be where the fun begin
the next_day when -PRON- all get to the office and review the lunch from the day prior -PRON- all begin to realize that each of -PRON- have come down with some_sort_of illness
none_of -PRON- be sick the previous day or the previous month
the only_thing that -PRON- can attribute -PRON- illness to be this_place
all -PRON- know that be after go_through 48 hour of a fever mix in with severe nausea and a horrible cough this_place be not worth ever eat again
-PRON- have be use accredited for about 18 year
extremely reliable easy to coordinate with
the techs be extremely knowledgeable honest professional and get the job do correct the first_time
fairly reasonable rate
good solid reliable company
do_not believe the hype
this_place be not that great
burger beer nite on -PRON-
would be a good deal but not if -PRON- have to wait an_hour to get seat
also this_place be not kid friendly
-PRON- do_not have a kid menu if that tell -PRON- anything
-PRON- tell the sever -PRON- have 4 adult and 2 kid
-PRON- rely -PRON- only have a 4 top if -PRON- want to be seat now
soooo do -PRON- tell the kid to wait outside
after watch -PRON- on agt -PRON- be even more amazing to see the magic upfront and personal
simply amazing
love -PRON-
do_not use_this_company
everything look good on the surface until -PRON- find out -PRON- do_not plant the tree right
first storm and both fall and break
arborist say -PRON- plant -PRON- wrong and root be twist around tree but -PRON- plant -PRON- anyway
have -PRON- gardner plant bush where the tree be only to find out that straight line do a poor job instal the valve
-PRON- all have to be redone
not worth the 5,000 -PRON- pay to have poor watering system by straight line
-PRON- complain but never hear back
-PRON- be only interested_in sell not customer_service
would have give no star if there be that option
get a coffee early this morning and pour in some half and half
the half and half be chunky and splash down into the cup
unacceptable and gross
the kind_of thing that -PRON- never forget
-PRON- hungry self find xolas after a walk along the beach
the overall vibe be invite and cheerful
-PRON- only have to wait a_few min to get the table by the window
there be something about this_place that catch -PRON- eye because as -PRON- eat many_people stop to check the menu and -PRON- feel_like tell -PRON- to just come in
the fish_taco be completely satisfy
-PRON- friend have the fry_chicken platter which be surprisingly light and fresh for a fry dish
-PRON- be simply a good eating experience
-PRON- highly_recommend -PRON-
cash_only
terrible service -PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be understaffed or -PRON- just do_not_care
a lot_of open table with long_wait
after stand in line forever while the cashier talk -PRON- head off to a couple talk how everyone know -PRON- as the costco guy -PRON- then check_out another lady and as -PRON- leave -PRON- say thank -PRON- betty
then -PRON- be -PRON- turn
no hello no than -PRON- and no goodbye
this happen as the lady be just throw -PRON- stuff in a buggy
never ask if -PRON- want a box so -PRON- have to get one -PRON-
then as -PRON- walk_away there be someone there without a red jacket
so -PRON- assume this a manager
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be the bad cashier -PRON- ever meet in -PRON- life
-PRON- just keep smile and never say a word

just have no use for rudeness
last aisle towards pharmacy at 2 p.m. on sunday july 16th 2017
do_not get -PRON- name
but -PRON- just refer to -PRON- as a-****.
this_place no_longer exist do_not buy the deal -PRON- have advertise on here as the restaurant will not honor -PRON- because -PRON- have change name
rude staff management suddenly do_not speak_english when -PRON- be have issue with the fact_that -PRON- purchase a vouch through yelp

-PRON- better be harvest from the grove deep within the kingdom of mordor past the misty mountain and the shire in a place where simple thing prevail where a man can wet -PRON- whistle in peace amongst brother who have also taste the glory of battle against the army of sauron
toast not bad tho
-PRON- favourite place for soontofu
-PRON- tofu be so silky smooth and -PRON- love that -PRON- serve purple rice which be a more healthy alternative
highly_recommend
-PRON- have have annual pass for 4 year and this last summer will be -PRON- last
the line management be poor and the park really be in need of beautification and maintenance in -PRON- off season
-PRON- do really_appreciate the upgrade to the cactus cooler lazy river and -PRON- make the ride so_much more fun and enjoyable
wnw really need to address a sewer problem by the bathroom by that ride -PRON- smell first thing in the morning and only get bad as the day grow longer and if there be a breeze blowing in the wrong direction -PRON- get the foul stench when sit in the shade in the chair
be -PRON- expensive
yes
but if -PRON- go at_least twice -PRON- go 4 8 time over the summer
-PRON- more_than pay for -PRON-
very_disappointing
there be two woman behind the counter -PRON- be not greet when -PRON- walk_in not acknowledge in the 20_minute -PRON- walk_around -PRON- be the only person in the store)- perhaps if one of -PRON- look up from -PRON- phone
-PRON- would have make a sale
many item do_not have a clear price and the store be disorganize
the only word speak while -PRON- be there be when -PRON- walk_out the door "thanks for stop in
-PRON- be use to come to this_place for a man cut
everytime the service be perfect
place clean quiet and service fast and accurate
-PRON- strongly reccomend -PRON-
this_place be pretty_good
-PRON- have be here 4 or 5 time now at both lunch and dinner time
-PRON- be not_sure_why there be never anyone_else in here though
maybe -PRON- be more of a pick_up place
the server be so sweet
lunch_special be $ 6.99 and include soup and a fresh roll
ton_of vegetarian_option -PRON- do -PRON- tofu really well
-PRON- recommend the cashew nut with tofu
-PRON- be still try to figure_out -PRON- spice_level
once -PRON- order spice_level 5 and could_not even eat the dish
during_lunch -PRON- do_not even ask -PRON- spice_level preference and -PRON- come with no spice at all
this_place be close for good now
drive_by and the shop be tear down
turn_out the volcano tea further down the street be independently own and do_not_accept the stamp card from the old place
-PRON- must also add that -PRON- have have one of the bad drink make here
-PRON- ask for taro slush san tapioca and get back a purple snow drink
the consistency be that of mash up snow
and -PRON- do -PRON- to -PRON- friend drink as_well
bad make drink ever
the only item that -PRON- have enjoy in the five time -PRON- have be there be the most_expensive item there the sushi plate
everything_else be meh
-PRON- lack flavor and presentation and the service be lack until -PRON- be take to a table
even then -PRON- be awkwardly position near the kitchen door where -PRON- be loud and the door keep fly open every few_minute
-PRON- request to be move be decline
-PRON- would_rather go to ko fusion if -PRON- be go to spend that kind_of money
cut be a cut above the rest
definitely one of the good steakhouse on the strip
can be a bit_pricey if -PRON- want to dabble into some of the high_end cut of meat like the wagyu but if -PRON- do -PRON- will not be disappoint
the decor and service be top of the line as be the steak
-PRON- have have good app and side at some restaurant in_vegas but the american wagyu -PRON- have be phenomenal
also if -PRON- be a chocolate fan the souffle be the good -PRON- have ever have
absolutely_amazing
if -PRON- be in_town and willing_to spend a_little_bit -PRON- need to come to cut
-PRON- have be contemplate lasik vision correction ever since -PRON- father and sister have -PRON- surgery perform by dr._moretsky and dr. cassidy serveral year_ago
-PRON- both rave_about not only the result -PRON- receive from the surgery but the professionalism of the entire staff
have two family_member validate an already impressive reputation dr._moretsky and dr. cassidy have build for -PRON- get -PRON- in the door but what dr._moretsky do prior to -PRON- surgery really put -PRON- mind at_ease
after -PRON- initial visit dr._moretsky conclude -PRON- be not yet an applicable candidate for surgery
-PRON- eye need time to settle because year of contact use have change the shape of -PRON- eye
-PRON- second_visit show drastic improvement though dr._moretsky want -PRON- to continue what -PRON- be do to see if -PRON- eye would improve further
the extra time allow -PRON- eye shape to appropriately change make -PRON- an acceptable candidate for surgery
two day_later -PRON- be schedule for surgery
this series of event show -PRON- that dr._moretsky be not in the business of collect money but vision correction
the day of the surgery be make very easy by the staff at moretsky and cassidy lasik
-PRON- appointment be at 1:30 pm and -PRON- be out at 3:30pm
the actual surgery time be very quick
the only part of the procedure that make -PRON- slightly nervous be the suction process to create the flap
-PRON- be an intense pressure sensation follow_by -PRON- vision go black which be normal
-PRON- be an extreme relief to immediately see no pun intend result after the procedure
-PRON- recently have -PRON- 1 month check up and -PRON- vision be 20\/10 up from a contact presciption of -3.50
obviously result be what really matter but dr._moretsky and -PRON- staff make -PRON- an exceptional experience that -PRON- would_recommend to anyone
great asian fusion restaurant
-PRON- be a group_of six -PRON- each order different appetizer and entree and -PRON- be all very_pleased_with -PRON- meal
-PRON- cocktail list be very original too
please do -PRON- a favor and order the banana foster for desert -PRON- will not regret -PRON- and most probably will have to order a second one
great view good music a perfect way to enjoy the strip without all of the noise pollution
the mandarin bar be locate_in the mandarin hotel obvi
this_place really be top with a fully stock bar and a great whiskey selection
the look of mandarin bar something straight out of the movie swinger if -PRON- be make this decade seriously this be place be so money
and -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- know -PRON-
there be limited bar seating but -PRON- also have belly bar table scatter throughout the venue and booth lounge seating that surround everything include the bar
the seating can be very tight if -PRON- have a large_group so -PRON- will be good off plan a night out here than just pop in
-PRON- would reserve a space near the window so -PRON- can drink and snack with a glorious view of the strip or some sweet airport action with henderson in the distance
this_place be smack dab in the middle_of the strip and give -PRON- an almost 180 view of the city
so -PRON- be definitely get what -PRON- pay for
quick tip park on the harmon side of aria and just walk over trust -PRON- this will save -PRON- parking and traffic time
cheer
yummy
pho soup be the good so_many variety seafood sirloin meatball and -PRON- fav 32 chicken noodle
rice_noodle so gf friendly
also many variety_of vietnamese dish
-PRON- husband have an_excellent catfish\/veggie plate
-PRON- also have a chicken\/veggie spring_roll wrap in rice paper
the dipping_sauce serve with -PRON- be superior
stand alone building in front of strip_mall
very casual family atmosphere
fair_price
bring -PRON- own bottle no corking fee
thank -PRON- yelp
-PRON- never dissapoint -PRON-
oven brick pizza with delicious flavor
get the italian stallion meat pie
crisp crust dough be light sauce be just delicious
san marzano tomatoes d.o.p. house make mozzarella schreiner 's sausage pepperoni prosciutto di parma
cotto sopressata all just tastefully do
every_bite be amazing
$_15 for the meat pie service be excellent
this_place be delicious
-PRON- get authentic and tasty food with friendly service
this_place offer great good without break the bank
there be three of -PRON- and -PRON- order fill all of -PRON- up
if -PRON- have never try ethiopian try -PRON- here
-PRON- have kifto and the abugida feast w\/ chicken
the spice be amazing
try this_place check_out -PRON- pic
-PRON- have go here for year
the staff be really good
-PRON- problem be with billing
-PRON- have a mammo recenty and pay -PRON- co pay at the time of service
-PRON- send -PRON- a text say -PRON- owe for the copay
when call in the man on the phone say -PRON- have no record of -PRON- payment and will freeze -PRON- account until -PRON- research -PRON-
this happen quite regularly
frustrating as heck
that -PRON- have to find -PRON- record to prove -PRON- to -PRON-
get -PRON- together bill and stop harrass
this_place can get pretty crazy crowd in here
-PRON- be definitely a skeptic but think -PRON- be more_than decent after -PRON- ayce meal
the fish to rice ratio for the nigiri be perfect especially for all -PRON- can eat
small cut of fish and the proper amount_of rice to make this one bite as -PRON- be mean for that much_more satisfying
that be -PRON- one pet peeve about ayce be -PRON- make massive portion and 2 roll max -PRON- will be stuff with just on rice
not here
the fact_that -PRON- offer salmon belly be a big score for -PRON- guest this evening
$ 26.95 for dinner just order a_few uni nigiri and salmon belly already pay for -PRON-
-PRON- all opt_for ayce so sharing be really convenient and allow -PRON- to try more thing on the menu
highlight for me- tako poke- though a little chewy with light flavoring more of a ponzu taste be a refreshing change
salmon belly- marble like crazy throughout but that make -PRON- that much_more buttery hamachi kama- fully cook yellowtail collar bone with a side of ponzu and chop scallion
-PRON- always find this dish so satisfy to pick at
uni-
nice delicate piece gently lay over a bite size amount_of rice
the seaweed wrap the whole rice with the leftover stuck leave out to the shape of number 6
rich and buttery yum
red_bean ice_cream and green_tea ice cream- scoop of heaven hint_of matcha and hint_of red_bean
not the good quality but definitely not too shabby
the albacore sashimi salad red snapper be all good too
the extensive menu include special for the night lot_of side_dish and the nigiri be the most impressive for -PRON-
-PRON- order but one roll to share amongst the four of -PRON- and the sexy girl be a no go
stuffed with the california_roll as the base a little piece_of the tempura shrimp and bit of scallop on_top over too_much whatev sauce and whole load of tempura sprinkle
-PRON- one other complaint be the temperature be set way_too high for the amount_of people in the restaurant
-PRON- be situate in a corner with the large table under the vent and the heat be so uncomfortable that the blast of cold air from the ocassional open door be more_than welcome
towards the end of -PRON- meal the service get super slow and ordering become more of a waiting game so -PRON- settle for -PRON- dessert a little sooner
sushi snob -PRON- be not but this be a decent sushi joint
-PRON- have not enjoy much sushi out here for the fact of be disappointed in comparison to hawaii and cali sushi
-PRON- be super_excited that -PRON- have this_place in henderson
-PRON- be not a perfect gym but -PRON- be a great value if -PRON- get in during one of -PRON- many promo period
the amenity be limit and the gym space be a_bit cramp but the location be great and the staff be good
if -PRON- be look for fancy toy and to be see this be not the place for -PRON-
if -PRON- want to get in and out for a workout close to home or the office for an affordable monthly rate head here
the food be not good here -PRON- have have both dim_sum and dinner before
-PRON- be overprice for such poor_quality
service be also garbage
-PRON- also hurt -PRON- tooth bite_into bone three_different time while eat the peking duck lettuce_wrap not suppose to have bone and on_top_of that the lettuce -PRON- cost $_5
-PRON- have never hear of an_extra charge for the lettuce
both time be a waste of money and -PRON- be never come_back or recommend_this_place to anyone
-PRON- have to admit -PRON- normally do_not like chinese_food
in_fact -PRON- be just about the only style of food -PRON- have not fall in love with at some point in -PRON- life
this be a real problem when -PRON- live with someone that would die for chinese_food at all hour of the day\/night
-PRON- figure_out why -PRON- never like chinese_food when -PRON- first eat at asian cafe express
-PRON- be because everything -PRON- have have have be americanize chinese_food
-PRON- be like an epiphany and seriously music to -PRON- tastebud when -PRON- actually find chinese_food -PRON- not only like -PRON- love
have authentic chinese_food change -PRON- opinion completely about this cuisine
-PRON- have to agree with the other save -PRON- the time and skip the first few page
go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic hong_kong style fare
holy mother of god everything -PRON- have try have be outstanding and each_time -PRON- leave say -PRON- be the good meal -PRON- have try thus far
everything be extremely cheap and the service be superb
the wait staff be always very_helpful and knowledgeable_about -PRON- food
-PRON- will be quick to recommend something if -PRON- be have a hard time decide
just ask
this_place get 2 out of 5 only because the food be good here
however the service be absolutely_horrible
the six of -PRON- go here to try -PRON- out since -PRON- usual place have go down hill
the pricing be very good although -PRON- do_not have any all -PRON- can eat
most of the roll be half price
-PRON- all order about 5_minute after get here
keep this in mind
after about 30_minute -PRON- first roll begin to arrive
-PRON- do_not see -PRON- server for this entire time
and -PRON- each get one roll
by the time -PRON- finish -PRON- first roll -PRON- second roll begin to arrive which be fine
but 2 of -PRON- at the table order chicken teriyaki bowl and 40_minute in -PRON- have yet to be see
so the two of -PRON- sit there with no food for this whole time so_far
at the hour mark -PRON- finally mention something the next_time -PRON- see somebody -PRON- server be still miss
-PRON- say sorry and that none be be make as -PRON- do_not_know -PRON- be order
after be here for about_an_hour and 15_minute finally -PRON- bring_out the bowl but one be chicken and one be beef again wrong
-PRON- do_not want to deal with -PRON- so -PRON- just eat that
-PRON- also forget two of -PRON- roll that -PRON- order and have to bring -PRON- up
throughout the entire service -PRON- server be see only once or twice and that be mostly towards the end
-PRON- wait long_wait time for refill on drink and someone at -PRON- table who order the meal do_not receive the soup or desert promise as a part of the meal
when -PRON- get -PRON- check -PRON- be amazed to see that -PRON- have add 18 gratuity automatically when -PRON- have not see -PRON- server at all the whole time
-PRON- complain and -PRON- take the tip off and another 10 off the bill for the trouble
the manager be nice about -PRON- and seem sincerely sorry
while -PRON- be there one of the other table just get up and leave before get -PRON- food
and the table behind -PRON- be receive the wrong item
this_place need to get -PRON- act together or -PRON- will not be in business long
the food taste great but -PRON- will not be return due_to the horrible service
hate nothing
dislike kitchen close before last call
like friendly_staff
open_late
menu be organize into helpful section
location be close to home
selection of roll
love nothing
sorry folk no picture because -PRON- be too_busy inhale -PRON- food
-PRON- go to hlb at the suggestion of a friend_who be crave something asian
-PRON- have not experiment a whole lot outside of -PRON- standard chinese takeout so the range of cuisine -PRON- offer make a good jumping off point for try something new
the menu be vast and can be a lot to take in but -PRON- eventually settle on the peanut chicken from the thai section
-PRON- have have thai two or three_time but have never manage to find what -PRON- try at the last place on the next menu so -PRON- do_not really have a favorite thing to look for
the peanut chicken sound pretty safe rice chicken peanut pea pod onion and carrot
-PRON- go for two_star spice
-PRON- love a good kick but since there be no standardization -PRON- would_rather have -PRON- be a little too mild than eye water hot
despite the dish 's humble description -PRON- be a really outstanding meal
the chicken be so tender the vegetable fresh and the peanut add just the right_amount_of crunch
no_idea_what all be in the sauce but -PRON- be in
next_time -PRON- may bump -PRON- spice selection up a level just to see two_star be quite tasty
but -PRON- think -PRON- may like just a_bit_more
-PRON- be also go to have to try -PRON- sticky_rice
-PRON- have have several friend live in or travel to thailand and -PRON- always look so delicious
can_not wait to go_back
delicious tortilla chip and guac
-PRON- have have the carne_asada quesadilla as_well
the steak be nice and tender and well marinade
a little more pricey than -PRON- typical robertos\/faustos\/amigos
but -PRON- be a nice change when -PRON- be crave the fresh_ingredient and a nice atmosphere to dine_in
-PRON- have frequent zipps\/gilbert for many_year
some quality issue lead -PRON- to try this_location
simply put
this be what zipps be all about
outstanding
the location be well manage
-PRON- experience tonight be what lead -PRON- to be long_time patron of the gilbert location
the food be as good as -PRON- have ever have at zipps or goldies
year_ago the kid work at zipps so -PRON- have very specific way of order -PRON- food
this time -PRON- be focacia 's and customize with lot_of sub pretty comical to hear -PRON- order
simply put -PRON- nail -PRON-
-PRON- order be perfect even good_than -PRON- would get when -PRON- work at zipps
-PRON- order golden medium wing extra crispy extra saucy
nailed that too
-PRON- server kaycee be excellent
friendly great pace\/timing could_not ask for more
the rest_of the staff seem on -PRON- from the hostess to the busser
the table be clear appropriately food deliver hot and fresh etc
even notice the manager run food to table
well run location
-PRON- hope -PRON- local zipps get -PRON- act together

clean bathroom

amazing kabobs.get busy but -PRON- be very good
fresh bread be on point
emily -PRON- server be a certifiable professional grade a cutie and a top_notch server
-PRON- start -PRON- meal with a smile and keep -PRON- come
-PRON- be a huge_fan_of all thing chorizo
-PRON- have zero qualm with talk_about this
there be a reason -PRON- be because -PRON- be delicious
there be several option for all the chorizo lover out there there be more of -PRON- right
the key be to try and spread out -PRON- appetite so -PRON- can finish -PRON- meal
-PRON- fail bad on this
start with the brioche cinnamon_roll
do that
-PRON- be devine
follow with the el paso omelet and -PRON- be meet with a whoa from -PRON-
emily ever the perfect server mention this be not an uncommon reaction to this monster
-PRON- be awesome and tasty and huge
this_place be a random yelp find for -PRON- and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- go in to buy some bare mineral and have hop to get color match for a new line of liquid makeup and despite the place crawl with not only regular associate but bare mineral associate tout -PRON- new product -PRON- be completely ignore
in_fact all but push out of the way from someone do a makeup consult on someone_else
now -PRON- do_not blame -PRON- for not help -PRON- be busy but not even a quick hi or can -PRON- get someone to help -PRON- nothing -PRON- stand there for ten_minute and get absolutely no help
this be not the first_time -PRON- have have iffy service from this store
but this be by_far the bad
the only good thing that happen be there be absolutely no line which be amazing consider every other time the line have be horrid
so -PRON- think a little planning be due
maybe -PRON- will just start buy -PRON- makeup on line
-PRON- get about the same amount_of service

-PRON- be like -PRON- must go place to find anything u can possibly need to give ur look that final touch
highly_recommend this_place

there be also an option to pay_$ 15\/person to bypass the first line yeah there be two line if -PRON- can_not stand the wait
by the time -PRON- pay the wait in line be at about 2.5 hour so -PRON- can definitely see that be worth -PRON-
the buffet -PRON- be everything -PRON- want -PRON- to be
-PRON- go to wicked_spoon earlier in -PRON- trip and be not very_impressed
bacchanal have a much large_selection of item and imho -PRON- be prepare much good
the bbq_pork be unusually delicious
the taco be make to order
the selection of meat and seafood item be out of this_world
-PRON- be so full after several pass that -PRON- do_not even make -PRON- to the dessert island
-PRON- do however see that -PRON- make fresh crepe so hopefully -PRON- can control -PRON- better next_time -PRON- visit
the service be great
-PRON- server be very prompt with drink service and attendant to all -PRON- -PRON- request
the patron and dress code be about what -PRON- would expect at a reasonably upscale vegas buffet
-PRON- read somewhere that caesar 's spend_$ 17,000,000 to build this thing
-PRON- show
-PRON- have be use_this_company for over 4 year and have have nothing but good service
the return call quickly and always work around -PRON- crazy schedule
great company
cap egg and cheese

original shop in the strip be where -PRON- need to go
get the real feel of night life after the bar let out and dem folk be hungry
yes

-PRON- love dunkin donut especially the chocolate munchkin
mmmh drool
but the service here be not invite
lose a star
the breakfast sandwich do_not appease -PRON- taste_bud and the price for what -PRON- worth be not worthy
overpriced
the drive_thru service be slow like slowpoke from pokemon
12minute that -PRON- wait for 6 munchin there be no one in front of -PRON-
if -PRON- be not -PRON- love for those chocolate glaze munchin -PRON- would not be come_back to dunkin donut
second_time see david copperfield in this theatre
seating and spacing be decent
-PRON- sit towards the middle both time and the view be fine not_sure about from the back
there be not too_many sign to the location compare to ka but -PRON- be fairly easy to find
this be where -PRON- go to get -PRON- fishing supply so -PRON- can create gyotaku print
-PRON- have a expansive collection of everything -PRON- need
the staff be friendly
sometimes -PRON- will find an_employee that fishing experience and sometimes -PRON- will not
-PRON- personally believe this be the good place to get a fishing license
-PRON- hubby and -PRON- love sushi
-PRON- have be all over the valley and -PRON- have -PRON- favorite
this_place be definitely not -PRON- favorite
will not be come_back
price be too high for quality
come for happy_hour and -PRON- menu for -PRON- suck
-PRON- have like 5 roll no one want on -PRON-
too_much rice on roll
roll be loose and fall_apart easy
and overall taste of the sushi be eh
pay_$ 44 for 2 people on hh
tomo near by be much good
improperly staff
one lady tend the bar wait table and probably cook too
the burger be tasty but the sausage_gravy be not so_much
cora 's do breakfast right
the restaurant have such a cozy homey feel to -PRON- when -PRON- walk_in
with simple menu drawing on the wall and the courteous staff -PRON- feel so welcome
cora 's have so_many different option that -PRON- may become frustrating but trust -PRON-
-PRON- really can_not go_wrong
-PRON- come on 2 separate occasion in three day and -PRON- order the 1990 's harvest and the crepe panini
the 1990 's harvest consist_of cinnamon french_toast top with fruit
the cinnamon french_toast be just scrumptious and the fruit be always a great touch
take a bite of the crepe panini -PRON- definitely find -PRON- say win
such a creative idea and so tasty
where cora really shin be -PRON- presentation quite_possibly the most beautiful plate of food -PRON- have ever see
order one of fresh fruit menu_item and -PRON- will not want to take a bite of the food and mess_up the beautiful design
if -PRON- live in canada -PRON- would definitely become a regular at cora 's
the reason mandalay_bay loss -PRON- be 4_star
one_star -PRON- ask for two room both with two bed and instead get 2 room with two king
after yell_at the manager do -PRON- change one of -PRON- to two queen

so while there be plenty_of 2 bed room and the reservation be make for a 2 bed room only the manager be able_to give -PRON- a two bed room
one_star -PRON- need a fridge for some stuff and -PRON- have to be ask 3 time for a fridge
on the third_time -PRON- bring -PRON- to the correct room
trust -PRON- -PRON- be enunciating
the room be rather nice and spacious
the bed be great and the bathroom could house 2 more people if -PRON- really need -PRON-
this review be write in the winter but -PRON- hear the pool and spa be to die for
2_star customer_service be constantly an_issue
-PRON- try to give -PRON- some information and instead_of listen -PRON- ask -PRON- point blank why be -PRON- tell -PRON- this
which be either preceed or follow_by the question ask for the information

-PRON- check the meat and there be the normal amount_of fat to -PRON-
-PRON- could_not figure -PRON- out
what_happen to all the hype about this deli
maybe -PRON- be a just a funky slab that day

the thing_about komol be that -PRON- cater to vegans and vegetarians alike -PRON- include and the food be actually good
the service be pretty_good as the people be friendly and frequently check up on -PRON- drink to refill -PRON-
-PRON- fav

politely very nicely and even touch your arm a_bit as a sign of camaraderie ask -PRON- why there be no salt and pepper on -PRON- table -PRON- do_not laugh at -PRON-
this be not highschool
and -PRON- be not some dirtbag janitor that go around smoke hash oil behind the dumpster and tease all of the kid that fall_off -PRON- skateboard and toss dirty mop water on -PRON- shoe when -PRON- clearly see that -PRON- be walk by and try to talk to a girl
-PRON- know
for a fact_that -PRON- be not a janitor because the washroom be pee smelling and be not adequately stock with tissue

note
also no ketchup or vinegar apple cider or white to be see
asian ribs yep
-PRON- will wanna pass on those unless -PRON- like bone with asian five spice powder no need for actual meat -PRON- will not eat -PRON- anyways
these go great with -PRON- white_rice dish that have some dry chicken and paper thin carrot as a garnish the peanut be fantastic -PRON- nail that
lettuce_wrap be just okay
but after the other culinary delight -PRON- be hard to feel -PRON- get -PRON- $ 32 worth
someone write chinese_food meet subway could_not agree more
-PRON- favorite yoga place
-PRON- be different from -PRON- other hot studio because -PRON- offer a variety_of class class be usually only an_hour and -PRON- be not crazy hot

but -PRON- do_not feel suffocate
-PRON- even have a non heated class yin which be amazing after a long hike or hard workout

-PRON- also have ton_of workshop and special
the instructor be amazing

the studio be very clean and the price be reasonable
$_5 friday be the good way to destress from the long week and get the weekend start on a healthy positive note
the food service be great and all
but -PRON- feel disrespect
-PRON- pay with -PRON- hard_earn money to have song play on the jukebox
-PRON- want to listen to -PRON- favorite song all star by smashmouth four time in a row while -PRON- enjoy -PRON- appetizer after a long day at work
so -PRON- be go about eat -PRON- fry_pickle which be great btw and -PRON- song be play twice so -PRON- be enjoy life
as -PRON- continue on and the song be about to come on for the 3rd time -PRON- be skipped

but then the 4th time be skipped
as_well
-PRON- pay with -PRON- hard_earn cash to just enjoy -PRON- favorite song and -PRON- be skip even when -PRON- pay for -PRON-
-PRON- expect more from such a fun place
-PRON- be just disappoint this time around
this be a necessary review update to eat -PRON- word since -PRON- keep eat lbt 's amazing sourdough kouign amann and coffee macaron
earlier -PRON- state that this be not a macaron place so as not to leave macaron seeker disappoint some people leave crappy review because -PRON- can_not get -PRON- macaron fix or if -PRON- painfully realize that soup du jour do_not mean soup everyday and that be just wrong
-PRON- start with pink heart shape macaron with fresh raspberry for valentine_'s_day and now -PRON- seem that assorted flavor of macaron be take a place in the display case
-PRON- select a coffee flavor pistachio and raspberry be also available for $ 1.20
-PRON- be medium sized with perfectly chewy cookie delectable coffee buttercream and an invisible sign state make fresh this morning
on a more disappointing note -PRON- beloved cannele have the taste and appearance of yesterday 's leftover
-PRON- truly miss the crisp caramelize exterior
-PRON- have also recently introduce kouign amann and -PRON- would pick this version over bouchon 's every_time
when available the french_onion_soup be vegetarian no meat stock and a great choice on a cold day
the shredded gruyere mix nicely into the buttery soup base
-PRON- never leave without some bread and -PRON- have not encounter a disappointing loaf so_far
if the sourdough baguette be sell out -PRON- have opt_for the 2 lb
sourdough or a parisien both be large and last at_least an_extra day in -PRON- house
lbt 's sourdough be the good -PRON- have ever try
-PRON- have a remarkable bubbly crust and an addictive sour flavor
crepe be another new addition to the menu and -PRON- will try -PRON- soon
just wait for that tarte tropizienne
-PRON- be seat_right_away host be very_friendly and seem to like -PRON- job
the food be ok mac and cheese be great but stay_away_from the soup not worth the upcharge
waitress need a lot more training in how to pretend to appreciate the fact_that -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to stop and give longhorn steakhouse and -PRON- -PRON- hard_earn money
-PRON- be the most unfriendly person -PRON- have ever come_across
never once do -PRON- bother to smile or thank -PRON-
-PRON- know in this day and age
-PRON- can_not ask a lot out of people but -PRON- have have good service at taco_bell
what a treat to find a beautifully decorate first class establishment right in -PRON- backyard
brio be wonderful
the three thing -PRON- look for in a restaurant be service ambiance and food quality and presentation
the service be excellent with attentive greeter wait staff and bar staff
the ambiance of the restaurant be that of a tuscan restaurant
and to complete the trifecta the food be present beautifully and taste as good as -PRON- look
-PRON- titillate -PRON- tastebud and be aromatic with a variety_of aroma not just garlic like many_other italian restaurant
-PRON- must make a reservation
brio be popular and with good reason
when -PRON- be seat warm bread and flatbread be deliver to -PRON- table
the server -PRON- have have be all enthusiastic attentive and affable
-PRON- be knowledgeable_about the food and stop_by regularly to see_how -PRON- be do
the special always be fantastic
recommend be surf and turf
penne a la vodka any fish dish and any dessert if -PRON- have room
sauce be distinctly delicious and different
-PRON- be worth try to find a parking spot in the mall
-PRON- stop in today for a late lunch
-PRON- opt to sit_outside since -PRON- be a fantastic fall day in_las_vegas
-PRON- order caesar_salad and a cheese pizza
the salad be very_tasty with healthy sized crouton and plenty_of cheese
the dressing be not too fishy in_fact -PRON- be very good
the pizza be cook great and the crust be the thin -PRON- have ever have
the pizza be very authentic rustic italian with lot_of sauce and cheese blot across the pizza
-PRON- only_complaint if -PRON- be force to complain would be that -PRON- serve pepsi product instead_of diet coke
the staff be friendly and attentive
the food be good a little_pricey for pizza but good
the good part be sit_outside and watch all the goofball think -PRON- be special walk_in and out of kona grill next_door
hahaha
have the fish and chip
fish be tasteless and overcook dark brown
-PRON- do like the outside area and the fact_that -PRON- have game bean bag toss
-PRON- think
oh_my
-PRON- will be back here for sure
wish -PRON- could have a float spa of -PRON- own
there be nothing like zone out in zero gravity relaxation mode
-PRON- need this at_least_once a week
-PRON- be like a total detox of -PRON- body and mind
chris and vianca be the wonderful owner manager of this awesome facility
-PRON- initially think there be pod here
nope -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- get -PRON- own private room and inside be -PRON- float spa room a large shower area and a nice space for dress
-PRON- can even choose to use -PRON- own music from -PRON- device
-PRON- really feel -PRON- be a more classier set_up
-PRON- do get a wonderful relaxation fix at another place a pod one that -PRON- try too
only -PRON- be a_bit claustrophobic over there but -PRON- also have a nice hot tea and honey stix setup for afterward
let -PRON- face -PRON- though this second_time -PRON- be only look_forward_to float and this time -PRON- husband and son want to do -PRON- too
-PRON- also find out allure have a float spa room for couple
so guess_what
-PRON- and -PRON- son be able_to try -PRON- first float together -PRON- be 10 and as tall as -PRON-
and both -PRON- big and little hunnie come_out say -PRON- fall in and out of sleep with -PRON- mind drift into space
-PRON- absolutely_love this experience
no pain anymore anywhere -PRON- have switch the light off stretch -PRON- whole body this time while float and when -PRON- come_out of the building -PRON- feel_like -PRON- leave the toxic stress baggage of this_world behind
and -PRON- be replace with all this positive energy
thoroughly impressed_with the knowledge of the volunteer the amazing animal and wide_selection_of product available
almost adopt either a pitbull pup name andy and the old dalmation\/bulldog mi alice
-PRON- travel from minneapolis and make the mission a must stop
the complexity of flavor with fresh_ingredient like the make at -PRON- table guacamole make this a great stop just for app and cocktail or a formal dinner
not good
-PRON- have a party of five and -PRON- each order about 5 6 dish each
the service be so slow wait at_least 15 60 minute between each dish
not good when -PRON- be hungry
-PRON- spend a total of 2.5 3 hour there
most of the dish come_out warm almost cold
which mean -PRON- cook -PRON- quickly but waitress bring -PRON- out late
-PRON- be busy but no excuse for serve cold food
enoki dish be the bad kobe_beef be a joke should not be advertise as kobe_beef
tofus be decent as be the hamachi and chicken
old waitress be arrogant and down right rude
when ask what dish be popular or good to order -PRON- say all -PRON- dish be the good very_helpful
also tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not receive one of -PRON- dish
-PRON- rudely insist -PRON- bring -PRON- to -PRON-
after argue_with -PRON- for about 10mins -PRON- go to the back and finally bring -PRON- dish
-PRON- eventually comp -PRON- as -PRON- probably know -PRON- make a mistake
-PRON- go here on the great review of yelp but -PRON- be very_disappointed
-PRON- leave hungry upset and totally have a bad_experience
-PRON- be bear and raise in cleveland
but -PRON- have not live there for 20 + year
that be say -PRON- know good barbeque
-PRON- be in_town for thanksgiving
have to have some
-PRON- family pick -PRON- up the taste be wonderful and bring back memory -PRON- will visit again
-PRON- wonder_if -PRON- can ship -PRON-
t
second_time here and both visit be the same
great food good service relaxed_atmosphere
-PRON- have the juicy lucy and onion_ring this last_visit and -PRON- be excellent
third and fourth visit service suck but food be still very good
service can be hit or miss but food be usually on point
the neighborhood need a decent chinese_restaurant chun fai chinese eatery will be welcome with open arm
-PRON- start with the wor wonton_soup
the portion be large with lot_of goody
-PRON- also have the shrimp chop suey beef chow_fun
each be very_tasty with a lot_of meat
plus if -PRON- live nearby -PRON- offer delivery
-PRON- see on the menu -PRON- have lunch_special -PRON- will be back to give -PRON- a try
this_place be locate across the street from southern hills hospital
this be -PRON- first_time try out this_place consider -PRON- be super busy the last_time -PRON- try come_here
unfortunately this will be -PRON- first and last_time here
here be why -PRON- should avoid this_place 1
take out charge 50 cents)- although this be not much -PRON- have never hear of a place that charge something that be part of -PRON- business expense
no other restaurant charge this type_of fee for something customer can_not finish
2
do_not_accept credit card- only debit_card and cash
however as -PRON- be go to pay with debit the machine want to charge -PRON- a surcharge for use debit
-PRON- be bad enough that -PRON- do_not take credit_card and do_not even tell customer in advanced but to charge customer for use debit_card as_well
here be another example of a business who indirectly just want cash
probably report only a portion of -PRON- earning to cra
honestly -PRON- have never be to any restaurant that have this type_of money grab business practice as a way to boost -PRON- revenue
3
food- good but nothing to die for especially when -PRON- charge price that be more_than other place -PRON- have be to
-PRON- order to roti curry curry_chicken and chicken vermicelli
vermicelli be not really authentic
-PRON- use the gui lin noodle instead_of the true rice_noodle mei fun that most other place use and the chicken portion be very small
4
service- average
-PRON- be a typical chinese business who think that just because -PRON- be get business -PRON- can treat -PRON- customer badly
annoyed at all the above -PRON- give -PRON- a $_1 tip to show -PRON- disdain for this_place the the lady have the nerve to tell -PRON- that -PRON- give -PRON- too little and that -PRON- need to survive on tip etc
-PRON- end_up give -PRON- two buck but be never come_back to this_place again
-PRON- like this_place
-PRON- be close to -PRON- house and pretty low_key
pretty_good selection of beer and food
$_2 a ball as the food truck say
-PRON- have beef or chicken try the asiago mushroom blue ball
all good except -PRON- put -PRON- all in one container along_with all the sauce merge together
have a great time here
great ambiance
-PRON- have a seat close to the kitchen so and be able_to watch -PRON- work away which -PRON- enjoy
the dessert be to die for and -PRON- do_not go crazy for dessert
-PRON- be a salt toffee chocolate bar type thing sooooo good
great service will return
cool concept for a tokyo bowl fast casual restaurant
kind_of like a chipotle where -PRON- can create -PRON- own bowl and pick -PRON- protein carb rice or noodle a variety_of veggie and sauce
-PRON- also have sushi and poke too
everything be make to order so -PRON- do take a_bit to make -PRON- food and get -PRON-
so if -PRON- be here on a lunch break make_sure -PRON- get 45min to an_hour
-PRON- do have online and app order to save -PRON- time
large_portion size too for a pretty_decent price
the regular size bowl have -PRON- full for quite a while
almost go with the large but -PRON- would have be too_much
first_time try this_place and not impressed
this_place be horrific
service be incredibly bad
lazy employee do_not want to make extra piece_of chicken
the restaurant be filthy with old food drink trash and napkin all over the table and floor
the trash can be not usable and have a note write on -PRON- that read
do_not use
food be greasy and disgusting
this_place need a health inspection
no wonder people mark this restaurant as closed
disgust
happy_hour fry calamari dynamite roll shrimp tempura do_not like the sesame chicken for a light cool drink
ozeki nigori be a must
this be -PRON- favorite pho place in the area
-PRON- be never too_busy but never too empty where -PRON- feel awkward eat alone
there be this one lovely hostess who always take order and seat customer who -PRON- simply adore
-PRON- remember -PRON- and -PRON- typical order even_though -PRON- have only be there maybe 4 or 5 time
-PRON- even serve -PRON- mom a free appetizer and ice_tea for -PRON- birthday today
-PRON- would have to say -PRON- be one of the reason -PRON- keep come_back
the other reason would be the un pho gettable pho
the bowl be huge
even the normal size
-PRON- always leave with leftover without have to empty -PRON- wallet
the price be very affordable and -PRON- love the flavor of -PRON- pho
and if -PRON- be look for a great appetizer try -PRON- fry calamari
simply delish
the only_reason this_place miss the 5-star mark be because -PRON- do_not think some of the waiters\/waitress that bring_out the food speak_english very well or be not very sociable at_least
-PRON- have some difficulty communicate that -PRON- want an_extra plate and bowl
also -PRON- special be not anything special in particular
at_least the one -PRON- have have
beef low mein sweet and sour chicken
-PRON- taste pretty_much like any typical chinese_restaurant
so if -PRON- be in chandler give -PRON- a try but have the pho
that will make -PRON- trip definitely_worth -PRON-
great place for a burger or even brisket
-PRON- stop on -PRON- way home and benny -PRON- be there and give -PRON- top_notch service
-PRON- have the mexican burger
-PRON- be perfection
nothing_fancy
just great food
have bring -PRON- kitten in due_to diarrhea
the doctor give -PRON- med but -PRON- do_not resolve the issue
-PRON- have -PRON- bad for a week
thank_goodness
-PRON- later find an alternative to the situation
-PRON- give -PRON- 3_star due_to this
another time -PRON- bring -PRON- new puppy in for -PRON- puppy shot
the doctor seem irritated because -PRON- be have a bad day or just exhausted
-PRON- feel the negative energy do_not_care to be in the room with this doc
wished -PRON- have another one that be a_bit_more pleasant friendly
-PRON- do_not expect a long conversation or an_amazing service out of just have shot
-PRON- be recommend_this_place due_to have multiple pet and be in the area
the rate be really reasonable too
fast service no appointmt which be what -PRON- like
this be the main_reason -PRON- do come to this_place
worth_every_penny
everything bite be beyond delicious
good lobster_bisque -PRON- have ever have
the filet with truffle butter be perfectly_cook and tender
-PRON- add creamed spinach lobster mash_potato and asparagus all be very good especially the lobster mash_potato
nothing but good thing with the warm butter cake
even if -PRON- do_not have room for dessert -PRON- have to have the warm butter cake
way over price
be out of almost_every cookie type except for some undercooked chocolate_chip
remember when this_place use to be the golf standard for chocolate_chip cookie
-PRON- neither
the burger be amazing
if -PRON- be tired of the same old burger this_place be a good place to try
if -PRON- like deep_dish pizza or have even the slight inclination to give -PRON- a try and -PRON- definitely should -PRON- can_not recommend mickey 's enough
-PRON- be for -PRON- easily the good pizza in mississauga and possibly the good in the toronto area
-PRON- chicago style deep_dish killer king be pure pizza heaven
the dough be just the right texture and consistency ooze with buttery goodness
-PRON- load -PRON- up with -PRON- outstanding mozzarella just the right_amount_of sauce and fresh delicious topping of -PRON- choice -PRON- like artichoke sundri tomato and onion but will certainly mix -PRON- up
even_though the dough and the cheese be the star here -PRON- marvel at how everything be in perfect alignment in_fact -PRON- once notice that the dough to sauce to cheese to topping ratio seem almost flawless
-PRON- be actually more noticeable in -PRON- traditional thin_crust
go with that if the killer king be too daunting or if -PRON- just want a nice change
the staff be super_helpful and super_friendly
take out be highly_recommend due_to the extremely limited seating as be call_ahead
also -PRON- do_not deliver probably due_to the fact_that the place be usually incredibly busy
but -PRON- be worth the drive trust -PRON-
as a final note many_people here and on other site have make note of how expensive mickey 's be and how the price have go up
while -PRON- be true that the price be cheap a couple of year_ago -PRON- be honestly too good to be true and -PRON- can_not see_how -PRON- be make much money off of each pie
in_fact -PRON- have even do a quick comparison of several highly rat pizza_joint in and around southern mississauga
here be what a large three topping artichoke sundri tomato and onion regular crust come to at a_few takeout place mickey $ 17.80 plus tax include free drizzle on_top great canadian pizza $ 17.45 plus tax
amadio 's $ 20.22 plus tax marconi $ 22.00 include_tax
pizzaiolo $ 17.95 plus tax fresh garlic be free
so in_fact -PRON- be actually cheap_than two other independent place in the area less_than a chain and only a_few cent more_than another indy place
and guess_what
-PRON- be good_than all of -PRON-
just some perspective
short review bachi 's new and healthy restaurant locate on the southwest side of town
good for breakfast brunch and lunch
if -PRON- know bachi then -PRON- know_what to expect here
a good meal great presentation and with a high_than average price_tag
longer review
-PRON- first hear of bachi hlk after see michael u 's check in 's
one thing_about michael u be that -PRON- try -PRON- all and -PRON- review -PRON- all
after_read -PRON- review and review -PRON- picture -PRON- know -PRON- would be head here soon
-PRON- get here sooner than later
so here be -PRON- review
-PRON- food
-ostrich burger w\/swiss $ 19.95
-PRON- be still on a quest to find a really good tasty and juicy ostrich burger
there be some place out here that be good enough and bachi 's be a couple of step above that
if -PRON- ever have an ostrich burger before then -PRON- know that -PRON- be usually a little dry and lack some flavor
the reason -PRON- get ostrich be because of the high protein count low calorie and low fat
-PRON- be like have a beef burger with the fat calorie equivalent to chicken
bachi get -PRON- right
-PRON- ostrich be juicy and pack with flavor
-PRON- also get about 8 oz of meat
for a minute -PRON- think -PRON- be eat red meat
if -PRON- be crave ostrich then bachi be the place that -PRON- will be go to
this be one healthy burger that also come with a healthy price_tag
-PRON- be $ 17.95 for this burger and if -PRON- want cheese -PRON- be an_additional $_2 -hlk
potato
nothing really special with this side
this be basically just season country potato
-almond
brioche french_toast
-PRON- get four disc shape french_toast dip in coconut custard and top with fruit
-PRON- share this with the gf and
since -PRON- be allergic to fruit -PRON- take the two slice that do_not have any
in other word -PRON- just have a basic french_toast
the french_toast be slightly grill and somewhat still soft\/creamy on the inside
first_bite be okay each bite get good and good as -PRON- get to the middle
some people prefer a crispy french_toast while other like a soggy one
-PRON- like -PRON- between the two and bachi
prepare -PRON- exactly like that
-PRON- recommend this
service ambiance and price service be great and as good as -PRON- get
there be no wait and -PRON- food be serve quick
also -PRON- do_not think -PRON- go 5_minute without someone check up on -PRON-
little tip for bachi sometimes too_much be not a good thing
sometimes -PRON- may need a little space to eat -PRON- food and enjoy -PRON- conversation
the restaurant be still new nice clean and a little small
-PRON- only_gripe about bachi hlk be -PRON- price
most item on -PRON- menu look appealing the item -PRON- have be fantastic but the price be a little high in -PRON- opinion
3 meal cost about $_60 or $_20 per meal
-PRON- think this that this be a little high for breakfast brunch and even lunch
overall -PRON- be a fan because -PRON- be a fan_of a good tasting ostrich burger
bachi have this and prepare -PRON- the way -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- local pub
-PRON- really love what the owner have do with this_place
the themed safari décor may sound cheesy but -PRON- be actually really stylish and quirky
the front bar be always bustle with a mixed crowd of local hipster and family
dog be welcome too
when -PRON- walk further -PRON- see the lounge area with sofa and a tv and even further be the back room which be more suited for large_group

the girl and -PRON- mean girl look 14 but say -PRON- be 17 try work hard\/carefully on the cuticle work and massage but -PRON- be the other ladies who do -PRON- paint that rush and do_not clean up the mistake
-PRON- may go_back for the mani pedi but definitely will not do french again
although -PRON- must admit -PRON- be one of the clean french line -PRON- have have that be do manually
-PRON- just be not pleased that -PRON- do_not clean up the nail polish around the finger and take sooooo long

low quality food
there be lot_of option but as a foodie -PRON- be extremely disappointed
-PRON- server be friendly do_not offer a beverage menu
water be barely refresh
-PRON- work in the hospitality industry and teach -PRON- employee to step aside and allow -PRON- guest to go first these_people just cut -PRON- off with not even an_excuse -PRON-
not worth the time or money
pizza be so wonderful meat eater
-PRON- have to get two more because -PRON- team be that hungry
patty be so friendly a d pablo the cook make the pizza with a smile
the entire crew make -PRON- feel_welcome

thank
this be a great place to read meet with somebody or just relax with some great coffee
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- miel and -PRON- drip coffee
great ambiance
live dj and dim lighting
the wait and bar staff be very good
the food be a little over price for what -PRON- offer
portion be typical of high_end restraint so -PRON- expect more flavor
not as much bang for the buck
but if -PRON- be look for a chill classy spot to get a fun fruity drink this be the spot
absolutely_horrible
nail_tech speak almost no english and -PRON- nail be terrible
-PRON- take 3 hour to do an acrylic fill with gel_polish
at one point -PRON- nail_tech stop do -PRON- nail to text on -PRON- cell_phone
-PRON- could_not pay -PRON- to go_back
-PRON- recently_purchase a brand_new chevy sonic
-PRON- notice when -PRON- get hot in the summer the dashboard plastic the plastic side of the front windscreen and all the plastic around the door include the back door be sticky to the touch
-PRON- bring -PRON- to -PRON- on two occasion and jesus the service person say -PRON- hear of 2 other sonics in the west that have similar problem with the sticky interior plastic
-PRON- wait for a call but no one call for month
then -PRON- go down there and ask to speak to the general_manager
-PRON- be tell on numerous occasion that -PRON- be not there
-PRON- leave numerous message with -PRON- and -PRON- never once call -PRON- back and only -PRON- assistant service manager call -PRON-
-PRON- say there have never be any record of -PRON- car be check there at findlay for defect even_though -PRON- leave -PRON- car there for 2 day all day
oh
-PRON- fail to mention the two year concierge agreement for $ 599
all -PRON- do be set -PRON- iphone up to -PRON- car 's stereo system bluetooth and call -PRON- now and again check in
a total waste of money
be totally unaware -PRON- do this
buyer beware
-PRON- want to also inform the reader that -PRON- oil_change service take too_much time and when -PRON- check_out -PRON- be meet with 2 grumpy lady_who do_not look up from -PRON- chair
-PRON- correct one of -PRON- when -PRON- be there last that -PRON- be in customer_service and -PRON- be polite to look -PRON- customer in the face when -PRON- be talk to -PRON-
-PRON- have since get -PRON- car service perform at jiffy lube who get -PRON- in and out in 15_minute as appose to 2_3 hour and -PRON- do_not charge all the add fee that fairway chevrolet charge
when -PRON- purchase -PRON- brand_new sonic -PRON- fail to mention the two year concierge agreement for $ 599
all -PRON- do be set -PRON- phone up to the stereo in the car
wow
really and annoying call for month and month check in
food be ok service be unfriendly and slow
feel_like -PRON- be do -PRON- a big favor by allow -PRON- to eat at -PRON- establishment
never disappointing
fresh warm and always delicious
the food be beyond excellent and never less_than that
-PRON- have be a customer for a few_year and the service be always great
one of the employee name martin never forget to ask how -PRON- day be go and always make the usual steak sharwarma plate come_out never less_than perfect
-PRON- go to spot highly_recommend love_this_place
if everything_else have be average -PRON- think that the garlic roll alone could have earn this restaurant 4_star buttery garlicky greasy ball of heaven
however -PRON- entire meal happen to be delicious also
all the entree come with a salad so -PRON- start with a tossed salad with -PRON- house italian which be yummy
a little thick not too_sweet lot_of flavor
-PRON- order the tilapia serve over spinach and artichok with a sun dry tomato tapenade -PRON- skip the heavy choice bc -PRON-
know -PRON- would overdo -PRON- on the rolls)
-PRON- be light although serve be huge and delicious
-PRON- also come with a side of pasta
-PRON- will_definitely be back here for more
do_not get the wrong idea
-PRON- would not say this be a date_night type restaurant
more of a family friendly casual place to get a good italian dinner or lunch without the italian chain restaurant stigma cheese sauce cream stuff everything ugh
dr. chris be a great dentist and the staff be all friendly and capable
-PRON- have a nice clean office too
this be something that -PRON- have to see at night and frankly -PRON- do_not hurt to have a couple of drink in -PRON- to really be sweep away by the music and the show
these fountain be quite spectacular and very interesting
the music be one of the good part and dance along_with the fountain
the light the color the music and the people all add to the experience and this be yet another las_vegas do_not Mississippi
brunch club be among the more solid breakfast\/brunch place in_madison
-PRON- have some tasty twist on breakfast classic good coffee and very_popular donut with unique flavor
-PRON- be not -PRON- favorite but -PRON- seem to be in the minority with that opinion
wait be long at peak time on weekend but that be a good time to eat at the counter
the restaurant have a contemporary take on retro decor with the whimsical artwork of eric joyner feature robots and donuts
there be one entrance to the restaurant from the street and another from the hampton hampton usually offer complementary parking to restaurant guest and that be somewhat irritate when -PRON- arrive only to find that parking be only for hotel guest on that day
-PRON- may be to discourage abuse of the parking for nearby event but -PRON- only seem to be an_issue for -PRON- when there be inclement weather
honestly -PRON- keep go_back so -PRON- can_not be that terrible
nacho be chip with taco_bell meat and obvious nacho cheese from a pump
the beer_selection be weak at good
noisy and the atmosphere be more dive_bar than lounge
will avoid in the future
first -PRON- would like to say that the good sushi -PRON- have ever have be at this little hole_in the wall on the ocean in virginia beach
ahhh sun setting wave gently crash drink -PRON- friend and -PRON- navy seal boyfriend and all of -PRON- crazy friend 80 degree weather back to reality
-PRON- love sushi but do_not eat exclusively at any one spot in cleveland
when -PRON- have a taste for -PRON- whichev restaurant be the close will be the choose one
there be several -PRON- will not go to otani 's in golden gate be at the top of that pile
-PRON- choose to review pacific east because while live in little italy this be the close
and -PRON- eat there at_least_once a week
-PRON- live on the west_side now but still work on the east
often -PRON- stop in to pick_up an order to go
over the many many_time -PRON- order have always be very fresh warm soft and just consistent
-PRON- be a big_fan_of consistency when eat a prefer meal at any give restaurant
-PRON- be irritate when -PRON- expect something that -PRON- just know be go to be good and taste_like -PRON- do the last_time -PRON- order -PRON- but
-PRON- doesn't
-PRON- guess that be why -PRON- old boss would always tell -PRON- to not to have expectation because then -PRON- will not get let down
expect the bare minimum and be pleasantly_surprised
-PRON- worship that man but never do agree with that piece_of advice
pacific east always live_up to -PRON- expectation
absolutely_horrible staff
not one doctor be able_to sit and talk for 5_minute
-PRON- make -PRON- go_through so_many test so -PRON- get money from the insurance_company
on_top_of that -PRON- almost never get -PRON- prescription refill easy
-PRON- never respond if -PRON- leave a message with the triage
by_far the most stressful place to get medical help
look_at an oil leak on -PRON- van for no charge even_though -PRON- be busy
these_guy be great
legit indian_food right here
locate on west craig and the 95 inside a tiny strip_mall opposite the gas_station
if -PRON- blink -PRON- will miss -PRON-
legitimate indian_food be hard to find in_las_vegas and if -PRON- do find half decent food -PRON- be usually some_sort_of infuse restaurant that cost an arm and a leg that be not very good
after realize saffrons be close than expect -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a shot and be not disappoint
every_time -PRON- have be here for lunch buffet dinner or pick_up the quality and standard of this business be 5_star each and every_time
-PRON- recommendation be the rogan ghosht lamb vindaloo and the garlic naan be all top shelf
the bar at the front of house be also not a bad little bar with large lcd screen with whatev sport -PRON- want
also -PRON- be a nice place to knock back a kingfisher while wait for friend
the service be also a fairly oil machine
decor be fairly simple and nothing outlandish that -PRON- come to expect from a lot_of good five_star place on the strip
-PRON- realize -PRON- be pump this business up and -PRON- truly do believe -PRON- a 5_star indian_restaurant
indian_restaurant be one of those hit or miss kinda place that can give -PRON- amazing quality or cardboard
so until -PRON- start to pump out run of the mill stuff -PRON- will keep -PRON- at 5_star
overall price $_$ $ out of 5 cleanliness 4 5 drink 3 5 basic bar food 5 5 service 5 5
do_not shop the produce here the selection be limit
-PRON- be sorry but this may be one of the creepy wal mart ever
-PRON- be not even in that bad of a neighborhood
everytime -PRON- come_here
i almost always get into an altercation with a crazy a customer
the staff may not be the friendlist but -PRON- would not be either if -PRON- work here
-PRON- just now walk_in because -PRON- really want a big iced_tea
the guy work behind the counter be on the phone and do_not even say so_much as -PRON- will be right with -PRON-
just keep chat and walk to the back room and do_not come_back out
so -PRON- leave disappointed
excellent and unique food savory noodle excellent ambiance
but the food be too rich that i do_not need to come_here often haha
maybe once a year be fine for -PRON-
but -PRON- be good tho but.m not for a daily staple
while in_vegas last sunday 10 2 2011 on conference -PRON- friend
and -PRON- stumble_upon this jewel restaurant
-PRON- sit_at the bar and be host by a very_nice and extremely helpful young_lady name sooner
sooner make the experience extremely pleasant and worth the visit
food and beverage be well coordinate
the experience and execution be excellent
this be why -PRON- love to go to vegas
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be so_excited to try this_place and man be -PRON- satisfied
the food come bento style and the portion be great for the price
everything taste so good
-PRON- definitely will be come_back and -PRON- will be bring people here as_well
this be a great place to go after work
-PRON- love to go upstairs to the patio that overlook uptown
the food be pretty_good
-PRON- be typical bar food
the drink be really good and inexpensive
in_vegas and want a good breakfast yelp this_place and -PRON- do_not_disappoint
-PRON- order the chili verde omelet the portion be huge
-PRON- be tasty and very_generous with the amount_of meat not spicy but that be ok
-PRON- husband love chicken fry_steak and -PRON- say this be one of the good cfs -PRON- be have
the gravy be very good
now the service be great
-PRON- have shirley and -PRON- be so cute make -PRON- miss -PRON- grandma
even_though -PRON- be old -PRON- be quick attentive and talkative at the same time
-PRON- be able_to walk_in get seat but do be prepare for a wait if -PRON- go on a weekend
the location be a little sketchy but -PRON- turn_out ok
what a concept a movie theatre that do_not charge -PRON- $ 70 for a movie food and drink for a family of 3
okay -PRON- be not go to be see the new release but for the price this_place be unbelievable
the movie be generally $_3 and the food be cheap_than harkins
-PRON- can also get refill on drink and popcorn unless -PRON- go to the late_night screening and the concession stand be close when -PRON- get out
really_cool ambiance at this_place look_at the picture
for budget conscious family want to go to the movie forget about go to tempe marketplace and forgo all food and drink
go here see a flick get -PRON- junk food and relax
this be -PRON- favourite local watering hole
the space be really big so -PRON- be never too_busy
-PRON- have a big big patio a big bar and about 3 or 4 separate seating area high top booth and regular table and one that be somewhat corner off if -PRON- want to have a big private party
the food be all great
though -PRON- reduce -PRON- menu recently
no more fry mushroom cap
-PRON- burger be garlicky and delicious
and -PRON- nachos be easily one of -PRON- favourite in the city especially b\/c
-PRON- be one of the few place that have lettuce on the nachos
over the year -PRON- nacho portion have get small but -PRON- be still amazing with layered cheese and ton_of sour_cream and veggie
a couple of qualm -PRON- can_not have booze on the patio after 11 and occasionally the server will be slow
but -PRON- find -PRON- be usually the new ish people
-PRON- have a_few server that -PRON- recognize who be always upbeat and on the ball with drink food and just all around awesomeness
this be -PRON- first_time at a korean bbq spot and -PRON- be really impressed
the food come_out really quickly and be really good quality
-PRON- order one of everything on the menu and double up on most of the meat
-PRON- guess the idea of have to cook -PRON- own food at a restaurant sound weird to -PRON- but -PRON- make_sense because -PRON- can cook everything the way -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- do wish -PRON- have more of a selection of meat for lunch but the dinner menu have some more interesting option and also include some sushi
overall chako be a great experience but watch out who be cook the food because there will always be that one person_who forget about something and burn some of the food
order from here with coworker from -PRON- office and -PRON- be all very happy with -PRON- food
the crab rangoon be really great
-PRON- coworker and -PRON- share that and pineapple fry_rice with shrimp and there be plenty for the both of -PRON-
maybe season the shrimp before toss -PRON- in with the rice -PRON- be very well cook otherwise perfect
thank -PRON-
-PRON- have be come_here for over 2 year since live in the hood not really regular but pretty regularly
have both be in the hospitality industry -PRON- enjoy sit_at the bar and chat up with other diner bartender etc
-PRON- still do_not_know -PRON- name -PRON- order not even a perk up with a recognizable nod get throw -PRON- way
-PRON- be pretty friendly people and damn good tipper but apparently not much leave an impression on the majority_of the staff here
-PRON- can_not say all of -PRON- deserve this review but
there a_few who deserve even bad
so why do -PRON- return
damnit the food be good
-PRON- be local always seem fresh make and
-PRON- have a magic spell over nachos that be just impossible to explain
the beer be ok -PRON- like four peaks 8th st. ale way better_than anything on this menu daily cask be typically a winner
the root beer be so_much good when -PRON- be not make with splenda and do_not have that aftertaste
but back to those nachos crispy thin chip perfectly layer with the right_amount_of cheese bean black olive tomato green_onion jalapeno top with dollop of sour_cream and guac
seriously -PRON- be never soggy or too_much
-PRON- know_how sometimes -PRON- get a pizza or nacho that the cook get too liberal with and think more be good
but -PRON- just ruin -PRON-
this_place have the right ratio
the salsa kick the ass of most mexican_restaurant in_town
the wing be crispy tasty
the house salad be a nice mix of real green and veggie no iceberg- whoo hoo
the flatbread sandwich be ok the burger be tasty too though the kobe be not that special in -PRON- opinion but -PRON- coworker love -PRON-
the bread
pudding
-PRON- will spin in the morning do a power yoga set eat veggie all day and have this bread_pudding for dinner
holy hell
-PRON- be amazing
that whiskey caramel sauce drizzle over the top beg -PRON- to bathe in -PRON-
come_here for some consistently good food know -PRON- be support a local_business and do_not get too upset when the staff downright suck -PRON- be not -PRON-
the burger of the week be good
but the waitress mumble
and -PRON- do_not realize -PRON- be the only $_5.00 burger
-PRON- be not even offer a burger passport until -PRON- want to get an attitude about -PRON- at time to pay
the other cheese burger be horrible and the two different_type_of mac and cheese be plain and microwave to reheat
not impressed at all
delicious hide gem
amazing price amazing staff fantastic food
the gyro be huge and will keep -PRON- full all day
-PRON- like the traditional gyro lamb good_than the chicken
a tough review to write
a mix of good and not so good
some of -PRON- be not -PRON- fault also
in -PRON- case -PRON- need to replace some damage flooring hardwood
however -PRON- precise hardwood be not make anymore or rather -PRON- change -PRON- so even_though -PRON- have the same name\/number
-PRON- be different
nobody 's fault there
to the credit of arizona flooring robert the owner -PRON- think help find a close match
-PRON- be the same wood specie and the color be very close
but the texture be different
-PRON- be either that or go with something completely different so -PRON- opt_for the close as -PRON- be go to get choice
the install do_not go as smoothly as -PRON- should have in -PRON- opinion
obviously -PRON- be more difficult when there be furniture and baseboard already in place compare to come in on a bare floor with no baseboard
-PRON- tear out the old flooring and then put in the new
-PRON- seem to -PRON- this crew be not as good as -PRON- should have be
when -PRON- be do -PRON- could see some of the raw wood in the seam imply the tongue in groove be not as tight as -PRON- should have be
this be the tough bit because -PRON- can_not be completely sure if that be -PRON- fault or if the wood -PRON- just do_not seat quite right
however -PRON- showroom sample do_not exhibit this problem and neither do most of -PRON- floor when -PRON- be do so -PRON- tend_to think -PRON- be the installer
-PRON- use a caulking material that also serve as a stain to fill those gap and hopefully color the wood
-PRON- do manage to do nearly the entire job without rip out -PRON- baseboard which be nice
kudos there
though -PRON- do end_up with some ding and scratch in the paint
robert be very conscious of customer_service
so -PRON- have to give bonus_point there
-PRON- be concern and responsive do -PRON- good to rectify any problem and make -PRON- happy
that be a good sign
as -PRON- type this -PRON- be await spare board in case -PRON- need any repair in the future
-PRON- crew do_not leave -PRON- a box and -PRON- be suppose to
-PRON- do_not try -PRON- tiling
tile be do by a different crew
so -PRON- can_not comment_on that
the install -PRON- would have to give 2_star but that may have just be the one crew
selection in the store be perhaps 4_star there be a lot_of wood to_choose_from
robert 's concern for the customer be probably 5_star
add -PRON- all up
and -PRON- would have to go with about 3.5_star if yelp would allow -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- will do 3_star now and if -PRON- have another experience maybe for some tile -PRON- be think of do
-PRON- can up -PRON- to 4_star if -PRON- go better
-PRON- have experience -PRON- drive_thru more time than in store however every_time -PRON- order through -PRON- drive_thru this_location busy or not constantly fail on deliver -PRON- order in under 10_minute
-PRON- be quite difficult to understand how something as simple as tea take so long to make
anticlimatic
$_10 for a glass of cheap cab
-PRON- will not be rush back
that be for sure
look next_door at sansotei
and -PRON- be full with people wait outside
have a short lunch break -PRON- jump next_door to gyugyuya and get the gyu curry rice beef
pretty_good food
-PRON- may avoid -PRON- next_time though because -PRON- be so salty so mainly just for health reason
-PRON- may just get the plain beef rice next_time
but for 12 buck before tax and tip may be a_bit expensive
service be good and fast
good for some quick lunch
quality 8\/10
service 8\/10
value 6.5\/10
overall 7\/10 not an average
i would_recommend no star if -PRON- could
-PRON- see this_place all the time and finally go in to try -PRON-
the food be way overprice no choice bland sauce and poor_quality meat
-PRON- go in with -PRON- boyfriend and neither of -PRON- finish -PRON- food
-PRON- think -PRON- money be better spend elsewhere
the bank be nice but slow
every_time -PRON- come_here
even if there be only 1 person here
-PRON- move slow as hell
-PRON- have be here a_few time but -PRON- will_never go_back there again
do to a large part of management and ownership
as -PRON- wait -PRON- have see -PRON- employee get chew out in front of customer by this woman_who seem to be the owner
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- be ever be to management training but -PRON- get the feeling that -PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- be do
-PRON- be seem stick up and rude
as for the food -PRON- be mediocre at good
the service by the waiter be good
-PRON- do have good chip and salsa
but -PRON- would not support establishment that do_not treat -PRON- employee well
nice arena on asu campus
-PRON- first_visit here be just to check_out the arena and of_course man 's basketball
-PRON- plan to come_back in the near future to see more game and maybe check_out the the concession
-PRON- come_here since -PRON- be at the airport right by
this be a small chipotle but -PRON- be sooooooo clean and the service be great
plus -PRON- be always a fan_of chipotle and this one definitely represent the company in a great way
yum
not awful but definitely do_not think -PRON- be worth -PRON- hype mainly because the crust be really bland
service be prompt and folk be super_friendly just not a $_15 pizza in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- favorite bagel place in lv
staff be really friendly
get the everything bagel with jalapeño cream_cheese on one side and vegetable cream_cheese on the other
sooo good
quite_possibly -PRON- favorite pottery barn in the valley
first -PRON- be easy in and easy out
-PRON- can park fairly close and not have to trek all thru the mall when what -PRON- really come for be right there in the pb store
-PRON- live in the biltmore area and instead_of go to close pb store -PRON- make the drive over to chandler to go to this one
the staff be friendly and helpful
-PRON- purchase a floor sample wing chair for -PRON- sitting room for_example and -PRON- load -PRON- into -PRON- little german trunk and wrap -PRON- in plastic rope -PRON- and even tell -PRON- a good cleaner that would come to -PRON- home and take off the floor dust
how could -PRON- resist
-PRON- be the perfect cozy chair at more_than 2\/3 off the original price
if there be something in the catalog that -PRON- see and want -PRON- will order and have -PRON- send to -PRON- home and once even to -PRON- place in dc
-PRON- even get a new homeowner 20 discount to go with
-PRON- be always a fan_of pb and -PRON- love the sale section

have not find outstanding wine there yet
but the food selection be good and the outdoor_seating fun
-PRON- nail stylist be q at first -PRON- act_like -PRON- do_not want to do -PRON- nail
but -PRON- do a great_job do -PRON- fill take -PRON- time do -PRON-
-PRON- add a gel top coat file down -PRON- nail at the correct length make -PRON- look more square
total cost be $ 21 which be not bad
the store have a sort_of fun_vibe -PRON- get to watch while the dog be grill and -PRON- smell good
the food be not good though especially compare to the other hot_dog place on broadway
also -PRON- be kind_of dirty inside and the cashier be rude
this_place be awesome
-PRON- treat -PRON- very kind on -PRON- tour
and -PRON- be kind to -PRON- as_soon_as -PRON- step foot in the brewery
the place be spotless
the tour be only $_10
-PRON- be about a 35 40_minute tour
the tour guide -PRON- have be great
unfortunately -PRON- forget -PRON- name
-PRON- know a lot about beer the history of the company and toronto
3 fired guy
-PRON- get to walk_around the entire facility and meet people
there be plenty piece_of art around the facility mostly in the office and the main bar
so for 10 buck -PRON- get the tour of the facility a free bottle_of steam whistle beer and a souvenir
-PRON- take the steam whistle glass
-PRON- can either get a glass or a bottle opener
there be a tour where -PRON- can get a case of beer as_well
make_sure to check the date and time of the tour
-PRON- find out about -PRON- last_minute
but -PRON- be definitely a great tour for the price
nice little spot nestle on the south side of town with kombucha on_tap as_well_as craft brew
nice atmosphere and doggie friendly
-PRON- just make -PRON- second trip to 1511 and -PRON- will choose somewhere_else next_time
-PRON- have be eat at mama ricotta 's for 15 + year and have eat at big daddy 's a couple of time
-PRON- enjoy both of the sister restaurant
so -PRON- do_not_know_what the problem be with this restaurant
on -PRON- first trip -PRON- want to start with the guacamole that -PRON- read so_much about on_yelp
-PRON- order -PRON- and just when -PRON- be start to think that the service be really slow -PRON- be a pack saturday_night
-PRON- entree come_out
when the manager that bring -PRON- food ask if -PRON- have everything -PRON- need
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- never get -PRON- appetizer so please cancel that order
-PRON- apologize and offer to bring -PRON- out now but -PRON- decline since -PRON- dinner be there
-PRON- do give -PRON- a coupon for a free guacamole which -PRON- think take_care_of the situation
another manager come by and apologize as do -PRON- waitress who -PRON- see less of than the waitstaff at all the table around -PRON-
the food be pretty_good so -PRON- know -PRON- would try -PRON- again
trip two
-PRON- get there early this time well before the crowd and order the guacamole forget the darn coupon and a beer to start while -PRON- look_at the menu
-PRON- beer come_out -PRON- order entree the guac come_out and before -PRON- could enjoy 3_4 chip -PRON- entree hit the table
-PRON- seem determined that -PRON- will not get to enjoy any guacamole
well equally determine -PRON- slide -PRON- dinner aside and dig into the chip
truthfully -PRON- be waste effort
-PRON- really be not that good
there be very little flavor
unless -PRON- snuck -PRON- in while -PRON- be not look there be no garlic no salt and no pepper add
-PRON- doctor -PRON- at the table but -PRON- have have good pre_make from the grocery_store and that be not $_9.00
-PRON- usually choose a local place over a chain when possible and -PRON- really want to enjoy 1511 but the entree be nothing_special and the service do_not meet -PRON- expectation
the price be high_than say on the border and while -PRON- never feel_like a sombrero wear group would start sing happy birthday to the table next to -PRON- that be hardly enough to bring -PRON- back
adios cantina 1511
a newer mid price hotel on madison 's west_side
-PRON- stay two night in september for a badger football_game weekend
the hotel be rather large 5 story and have quite a_few room
-PRON- have a junior suite which be in the corner so have some extra floor space which include a small kitchenette sofa sleeper desk and tv
not quite two room but a good amount_of space especially if -PRON- be stay for an extended period of time
overall the room be clean and comfortable although not terribly chic or stylish just one big beige space
-PRON- certainly understand the desire for a timeless color pallet but -PRON- could do with a_bit_more personality
as for the room feature the bed be quite firm which -PRON- like as be the pillow not so great
bathroom be on the small side but have all that -PRON- need
-PRON- go here last_night for -PRON- brother 's 30th birthday
-PRON- be pricy but definitely_worth -PRON- for a nice ocassion
plus
-PRON- highly_recommend the moscow mule
-PRON- have vodka homemade ginger beer ice cube that do_not melt and be serve in a copper mug that stay cold
the bartender carol be super_nice and cool
a must
great atmosphere at the tempe location
great beer pizza and salad
come_here on a thursday_night there be karaoke go on
and -PRON- be 40 50 full a little info hookahs -were km hookah bowls
-where vortex phunnel
hose -tonic plastic washable shisha -alfakher starbuzz fumari etc
-PRON- have most common brand coals starbuzz coco buzz coconut coal
-PRON- offer soda chip popcorn candy
what -PRON- do_not like staff be dress normal and take -PRON- 10_minute to identify someone that could actually help -PRON- table be dirty and have empty bottle and wrapper every where so -PRON- could_not tell if -PRON- be occupy or take -PRON- be sit by a young_man and -PRON- do_not even_bother to grab the trash on the seat or table
this definitely will not be -PRON- first choice for a hookah lounge if -PRON- go out
so to begin christina do a great_job take -PRON- from brassy golden blonde and level 5 brown to a bright buttery icy blonde
-PRON- would go to -PRON- again because -PRON- color skill be there and -PRON- slap those highlight on super quick
three_star because -PRON- call and confirm that -PRON- clip in extension could be color
-PRON- be tell yes
but -PRON- be not responsible if -PRON- be damage which be totally fair
when -PRON- arrive the first thing christina and -PRON- talk_about be how -PRON- be not comfortable color extension because -PRON- always turn_out pink or some crazy color
ok
good thing
-PRON- drive 2_hour from tucson to come to this salon that look_like -PRON- pretty on_top_of blonde hair and extension
anyways -PRON- do a test color after -PRON- make -PRON- very clear that -PRON- would prefer -PRON- hair be grey\/green on the ash scale vs. golden or warm at allllll and -PRON- come_out pink as predict
-PRON- ask what color -PRON- use and -PRON- tell -PRON- 7n and 7g
-PRON- mean g like golden
yes g like golden
oh
in the past mention this also
-PRON- have have stylist use 7aa and the color turn_out awesome(ly not pink
moral of the story do_not bring -PRON- own extension
christina do solid highlight work and there be little to be find of -PRON- rusty old color
probably not worth a 4 hour round trip plus chair time
-PRON- have never have bad service in the 4 5 time -PRON- have be here in the last two month and this be the perfect after work cool off happy_hour joint
the beer be never stale and -PRON- always get another when need request
app be always great
-PRON- have more con 's about the cheeser who seem to irritate the bar tender
wait staff than the joint -PRON-
-PRON- would_recommend this as a good place to chill with -PRON- friend and kick back a_few drink
godevils
-PRON- be there today around 11 pm have a feeling for a pad
thai and -PRON- be the only open at the hour
order a mix of chicken and beef -PRON- arrive to pay and see -PRON- be charge an_extra $_2 for chicken when -PRON- specifically ask for mix
-PRON- get home anxious to try one of the most_expensive pad
thai 's -PRON- eat in_las_vegas $_14
not only -PRON- be cheap on the amount_of chicken and beef
-PRON- be the bad pad
thai -PRON- have in_town
-PRON- will not come_back or refer anyone
-PRON- would say -PRON- be good overall
reception be 24_hour so arrival time at the hostel be less of an_issue when check in
and the staff be really nice and very_helpful answer_any_question -PRON- may have
the room be nice with enough space between the row of bunk bed
and each room have -PRON- own set of locker as_well_as -PRON- own bathroom
the bed be comfortable but sometimes -PRON- may not have a ladder for the top bunk
make_sure -PRON- tell the staff about this as -PRON- can be difficult and dangerous to reach the top bunk
the bathroom be good with enough room for 1 person
though with 6 or more people in the room that can be an_issue when -PRON- come to crowd
but there be an alternative which be use the bathroom in the lounge area mainly for sink and toilet
there be the option of the elevator if -PRON- have a lot_of luggage and need to get to the high floor
the hallway look interesting with each door be decorate like a country 's flag
plus there be an outdoor swimming pool
there be a lounge area where -PRON- can hang_out
and there be a pool_table along_with shelf that have book and board game
plus there be a kitchen as_well
and -PRON- seem_like so_much space in these room and more
there be a couple computer by the reception desk
one of -PRON- be work good while the other be have a problem
also if -PRON- need to print something -PRON- will have to e_mail the link to reception in order to have -PRON- print out
and wifi be include as_well
the hostel -PRON- be a great one
the location be the only main issue which be out of the way from
well everything_else
definitely plan accordingly which may mean end -PRON- night early if -PRON- have an_early morning flight

-PRON- server be carlo both time and -PRON- be attentive and awesome
-PRON- tell -PRON- the place be like a family and as -PRON- look around -PRON- see the staff work as a team and help each_other
-PRON- like that about any place- but the food and cocktail in this_place
put -PRON- above the other restaurant around this area of town

-PRON- have such a great experience at this restaurant
all of the food be exceptional
-PRON- have a wedge salad and the ribeye with a side of mushroom and crunchy potato

and unless -PRON- refund -PRON- flight or bag or something -PRON- will make_sure everyone -PRON- know include -PRON- 3,000 fb friend family etc know_how horrible of an airline this be
-PRON- will be surprised if -PRON- be still in business within the year

-PRON- show_up at 11:30 -PRON- open at_11_a.m. and -PRON- wait for over_an_hour to place -PRON- order but -PRON- be worth_every minute in line
the pull_pork be also perfection and the sausage be amazing
the bean and potato_salad leave something to be desire but be delicious all the same

some of the product do_not have size list
the facebook advertisement say there would be food drink and a food truck there be not
clothe seem cheap and be all wrinkle
pretty_much everything be small size
-PRON- understand this be an opening and thing will improve but there already be an exist store
oh and the bad thing the fb ad and there website have one address but the store be a mile over
-PRON- have to call the mesa store to find out where -PRON- be
-PRON- be tell the manager must have forget to change -PRON-
-PRON- would_recommend the wish app same product a lot cheap
cheesecake factory be -PRON- absolute fave restaurant but this be the second_time -PRON- have be at_this_location and have sub_par service

the manager come_out and say -PRON- still have -PRON- food in the window -PRON- have not throw -PRON- away -PRON- can make -PRON- fresh biscuit and re plate -PRON- like really
-PRON- do_not want that
-PRON- be just totally upset and as much as -PRON- love this restaurant
-PRON- will not be back at_this_location
a big_fan perhaps one of the good pizza place in the whole gta
be feel seafood for -PRON- birthday but want to try something a little different_than popular place like boiling crab and hot n juicy
-PRON- also have a fairly good amount_of people in the party
so -PRON- look for place with the good prices\/option
like hot n juicy this_place have family style order option but more value in -PRON- such_as more pound of seafood and high_quality seafood for a slightly cheap price
the option look amazing so -PRON- book the reservation and give -PRON- a try
-PRON- go on a thursday_night
so -PRON- be not crowd at all
although -PRON- should be be shocking that -PRON- be not
hospitality be wonderful
the waitress be very kind attentive and help of -PRON- need
especially kim -PRON- main waitress
-PRON- also have a great sense of humor
on to the food -PRON- be all delicious
-PRON- pick just the right flavor and everything taste fresh
-PRON- get the regular and kumamoto oyster
-PRON- be still long for more of those
-PRON- pick 2 of the big family size order
the clams king_crab and snow crab be killer
although -PRON- be all tasty those just stand out more to -PRON-
one order -PRON- mix garlic butter and lemon pepper with mild spice
the other be the urban mix with mild as_well
both be delicious just depend_on what -PRON- feel_like more
feel a little more spice then -PRON- would go with the urban mix
-PRON- also get calamari and a_few order of shrimp fry_rice
everything be perfect and great together
-PRON- will_definitely be go again and more_often
this be go to be -PRON- new go to for this kind_of seafood
good food for the price
the server be always good
big place standing room only
fast service
sometimes -PRON- feel_like -PRON- have to hurry and eat and go
not a leisurely atmosphere but kid friendly
-PRON- can_not beat the happy_hour
great sushi selection all at a great price
the crazy and dragon roll be delicious
if sushi be not -PRON- thing order the teppenyaki
-PRON- have never be disappoint here
update -PRON- end_up take $_10 off -PRON- bill and refund -PRON- to -PRON- credit_card
-PRON- would go here for the skinny margarita but not the food ever
omg
how hard be -PRON-
first -PRON- order the queso and chip which what come be a cold mold scoop of something resemble spicy process pimento_cheese dip that -PRON- send back because -PRON- be disgusting
then the lady_who be wait on -PRON- offer to bring -PRON- some salsa for -PRON- chip
ok so -PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- have
so -PRON- say -PRON- can bring -PRON- the tomatillo
-PRON- do_not_know because no one ever tell -PRON- that the terrible salsa -PRON- bring -PRON- be replace the terrible queso
the guacamole also be not good but sort_of familiar
so -PRON- eat -PRON-
then all of a sudden there be some other waiter with red hair and a terrible acne problem who -PRON- do_not_know who -PRON- be act_like -PRON- be wait on -PRON- who bring -PRON- -PRON- bill and then can_not stop talk and just take of the situation and take the $_5 off the bill for the nasty food -PRON- do_not eat after -PRON- explain this entire story to him
-PRON- hem and haw because -PRON- say -PRON- do_not_know and
blah blah blah tell -PRON- this be not a tex_mex restaurant -PRON- be more southwest mex and for -PRON- to think mesa desert finally say do -PRON- want -PRON- to get the manager
omg
really -PRON- can_not take_care_of the situation and now -PRON- have to repeat -PRON- to another person for the $_5 that should have be remove from -PRON- bill in the first place due_to -PRON- nasty food that -PRON- send back
but ya_know what fine
-PRON- do_not have time for -PRON- incompetence for a whole $_5
so -PRON- can keep -PRON- $_5 the $_4 tip -PRON- leave on the $_20 bill
welcome to -PRON-
yelp_review for -PRON- trouble and get rip_off and completely put out by -PRON- numbskull behavior and not just take_care_of the situation by remove the $_5 from -PRON- bill instead_of argue_with -PRON- about
ridiculous
fyi -PRON- have be to the mesa desert in the southwest in both arizona and new mexico where -PRON- know hatch green chile come from
and -PRON- get the same kind_of queso as -PRON- get in texas consider -PRON- use hatch green chile in -PRON- hot queso dip as_well from hatch new mexico
roll -PRON- eyeball
-PRON- stop_by this_place as -PRON- be very close to -PRON- apartment
and -PRON- have always be curious about -PRON- what be a jack flap
-PRON- fiancé and -PRON- split a cherry cola jack flap cola peach cherry cobbler streusel whip_cream also the veggie omelet
the veggie omelet have caramelize onion roasted red_pepper brie and arugaua which give -PRON- a nice crisp bite
-PRON- feel_like the food have a pretty different thoughtful and uniqueness to -PRON-
the jack flap be fluffy and delicious with each ingredient compliment the other
the omelet also have great ingredient with the arugula and brie play off one another
-PRON- be busy but the service be still pretty_decent -PRON- feel the vegetable hash be a very nice_touch and creative more_importantly delicious
the coffee be also pretty_good
-PRON- will_definitely be back
as -PRON- finish write this -PRON- realize -PRON- have no choice but to leave a perfect rating as this hit every aspect -PRON- would expect in a good breakfast spot
the price could maybe come down just a tiny bit but overall -PRON- be right where -PRON- should be
horrible customer servie unnecessarily rude service staff that talk down to -PRON- and a small selection of rental equipment
-PRON- will go_back only if -PRON- have no other option
-PRON- recently_move to the area and have be on the hunt for a good bagel shop\/bakery
-PRON- have be here_twice now and have not be impressed either time
the first_time -PRON- go inside which be nice
-PRON- order the cinnamon bagel with honey_walnut cream_cheese
-PRON- must_say that cream_cheese be divine
the blueberry muffin be a joke really greasy and not tasty
-PRON- come_here again for breakfast and go to the drive_thru which be really fast and efficient
-PRON- just keep -PRON- simple with a plain bagel and plain cream_cheese and do_not have any complaint
all in all this_place be ok but nothing_special
-PRON- really wish -PRON- have more bakery item to_choose_from since -PRON- restaurant have the word bakery in -PRON-
delicious food and probably the good burger in_las_vegas
but make_sure -PRON- have plenty_of time to wait
once -PRON- put -PRON- name on the list -PRON- a good 45_minute before -PRON- get any glimpse of -PRON- food
if server here work in an emergency room patient would be dead in the grave before -PRON- get -PRON- name call
try -PRON- out last_night for the first_time
bad service -PRON- have ever experience
be not greet_by anyone so guess -PRON- should seat -PRON-
finally an annoyed look waitress come over to get drink -PRON- return with empty kid cup and a pitcher of water for -PRON- to fill
wing be deliver with no plate drink be empty
finally pizza be deliver and plop next to the table without so little as a smile
so -PRON- have to stand up to serve -PRON- family
-PRON- pizza again drink empty
pizza be subpar at good
-PRON- have to get up to find waitress gossip and play on -PRON- phone behind counter for silverware plate and drink
when the bill arrive -PRON- have add gratuity because -PRON- be a party of 5
go with -PRON- husband and 3 kid young of whom be a baby
wow bad service and shady waitress
this sunchain location have the good staff ever
always super_friendly and helpful
great tanning lotion and suggestion also
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go to the sushi make class at aip
get creative and -PRON- be a blast
-PRON- show -PRON- exactly_what to do in prepare sushi from start to finish and talk_about the history behind -PRON-
-PRON- make a ton_of roll inside out cone etc and -PRON- give -PRON- a variety_of ingredient to add and create
-PRON- be a great event and -PRON- be something_different to do for a date_night
-PRON- have lot_of other class and some be multiple day
-PRON- will def be sign_up for another class soon and can_not wait to see what -PRON- will learn next
-PRON- get the work do but -PRON- be interested_in what most car shop be interested_in -PRON- money
-PRON- have a lot_of repair work recommend for -PRON- car that in -PRON- opinion be not necessary
-PRON- would skip this_place as there be good service shop in the area
of_course -PRON- be best know for the weird stuff
as a transplant from new_york who believe that the regular cheese slice be the high human creation -PRON- be horrify by the idea of mac_n_cheese or taco pizza or_whatev oddity be available on a give day
but what often get overlook about ian 's be that -PRON- cheese slice be very good
so_many place just pile cheese on bread neglect the third of the canonical pizza ingredient and while cheese be delicious at ian 's -PRON- take the sauce seriously as_well
in -PRON- view -PRON- be the good new_york style slice in_town
-PRON- have have a_few of the less adventurous specialty slice and -PRON- be good too
but do_not let all the hype about all the strange slice or the image of the place as the place where drunk college student go at 2_a.m. deceive -PRON- ian 's pizza be really good
sakura al
alternative zu fai sushi wollten meine
kollegen und ich schon lange ausprobieren
die inneneinrichtung ist eher karg obwohl die
roten laterne draussen ganz nett waren
die bedienung ist begrenzt freundlich aber recht flott und_die abräumgeschwindigkeit lobenswert nicht ganz unwichtig beim run sushi
meine kollegen haben sushi all -PRON- can eat genomman während ich ein gericht aus der mittagskarte bestellt habe
beim sushi bewertung muss ich mich meinem vorgänger anschliessen be da auf dem band einem entgegenkaman hatte in den meisten fällen mit original sushi nur sehr entfernt be zu tun
da es mittags war und da buffet nur
9,- kostete
waren die eher teureren
nigiris auch rar und schnell weg
meine kollegen waren trotzdem zufrieden schließlich ist das sushi bei fai deutlich teurer und auch nicht viel besser
mein mittagsteller mit suppe war jedoch für den
preis erstaunlich lecker und appetitlich zubereitet
der reis war flockig die sauce geschmackvoll und das gemüse frisch und das ganze für 5,5 eur
dass der chinesische teil der speisekarte deutlich besser war mag damit zusammenhängen dass alle
mitarbeiter des restaurants chinesen waren und nicht japanern
meine kollegen wollen auf jeden fall wieder hingehen wenn sie lust auf sushi haben und ich werde wieder be chinesisch bestellen
as a former resident of western washington -PRON- feel -PRON- be necessary to make -PRON- clear that this haggen be no haggen
this_location and -PRON- be assume the other in the valley lack the piece that make haggen awesome the delightfully complicated floor plan the wide_selection_of specialty and organic food wonderful and fresh produce and a make to order deli with sandwich sushi and salad\/cheese\/olive bar that be a regular lunch staple for -PRON-
if any east coaster be familiar_with wegmans haggen be like a west_coast wegmans
sure when money be a little tight -PRON- would go to haggen just for meat produce and a meal from the deli and pick_up the other pantry staple somewhere cheaper but the price -PRON- pay for those item be well_worth the extra cost
here though the produce be overprice and low quality the deli be absolutely nothing like how -PRON- should be and -PRON- find expire milk and bread
-PRON- husband and -PRON- be so_excited when -PRON- get the mailer think -PRON- could return to -PRON- favorite grocery_store from wa
however this_location be basically probably literally an_old vons that -PRON- put no effort into make a real haggen -PRON- just slap some haggen sign throughout
-PRON- be disappointed and will_continue shop at sprouts on w. sahara
-PRON- be at the beaches the other day and see that a line be start to form outside this restaurant
so of_course -PRON- have to see what the fuss be all about
the place be pack
-PRON- be the thursday evening before the good friday holiday but -PRON- do_not really need to wait that long 15_min max maybe
-PRON- wish though that -PRON- have a big waiting area or at_least a warm one anyway
the interior be cozy and like another_reviewer already mention -PRON- do get a little noisy
service be friendly and quick
-PRON- get the chicken shish kebob with house salad and basmati rice and -PRON- friend order the salmon fillet with white_wine cream sauce with caesar_salad and mash_potato
-PRON- chicken be juicy and grill just right
even without the sauce that come with -PRON- -PRON- be so tasty
two skewer come_out to about 9 piece_of chicken which be way_too_much for -PRON-
have enough to take home and eat for lunch the next_day
the salmon although also very good be swim in the cream sauce
if -PRON- like that sort_of thing -PRON- may appreciate the extra extra extra sauce
but -PRON- would have prefer the sauce cut in half
-PRON- would have be just as delicious
what -PRON- must stay_away_from however be the peach bellini which taste so_much like robitussin or_whatev -PRON- cough syrup preference
all in all though -PRON- be a great meal
be about $_50 for two
so not so bad as the serving be huge
would definitely go_back and try other item in the menu like the trout and maybe -PRON- salad
-PRON- be persian i come from san jose ca to visit -PRON- friend and -PRON- take -PRON- to persian room and this be the good persian food outside of iran and ca
try the koobideh -PRON- will not regret -PRON-
very_flavorful delicious food
cafe soban may now be the place for -PRON- to hang_out and chill while wait for -PRON- date
black sesame_seed latte $ 4.49
need -PRON- say more
right at the corner of yonge and finch talk_about location
plush comfy seating with ton_of booth seating overlook yonge or finch talk_about scenery
fast reliable wifi and with ton_of outlet
-PRON- usually hang_out at starbucks across the street but lately -PRON- wifi never work
not too_busy but do have kpop as background
if that be not -PRON- thing maybe -PRON- need some ear plug
-PRON- use et limo for -PRON- wedding
-PRON- just take -PRON- and -PRON- wife back to the hotel and -PRON- only regret be that -PRON- do_not use -PRON- for more of -PRON- transportation
-PRON- choose the chrysler 300 stretch which be one of the cool limo -PRON- have ever be in
-PRON- driver be on time early even courteous and helpful
-PRON- be exactly_what -PRON- be look for in a limo company
take -PRON- wife here on a date
-PRON- go on a friday_night and get seat within 20_min
-PRON- server would not stand still long enough to get -PRON- whole order
-PRON- actually have to stop -PRON- from walk_away so -PRON- could order a beer
-PRON- could never get -PRON- stationary long enough to order -PRON- wife a drink
so -PRON- stick with the water that never get refill
-PRON- wife get the rubin melt -PRON- be ok
but -PRON- say -PRON- would not come_back for -PRON-
-PRON- have the triple bypass burger and -PRON- be one of the good burger -PRON- have have
-PRON- beer brew on_site be amazing
the atmosphere be a little loud
but_hey -PRON- be a friday_night
-PRON- would have give this_place 4_star if the service be not so poor
-PRON- have have a_few people contact -PRON- about -PRON- experience and ask how -PRON- eyebrow be now and figure -PRON- would post an update
-PRON- be still extremely happy with -PRON- eyebrow
-PRON- look great and natural and over the moon
-PRON- have post before and after picture
-PRON- will_definitely be go_back every couple of year for a touch up
-PRON- go there expect a kind_of bland taste that -PRON- would expect from a healthy burger joint
the food be very good good_than expect
-PRON- be a little_pricey and everything be separate i.e. burger be separate from fry from drink there be no value meal
other_than_that very much recommend
this_place be tuck in at tecumseth between king w and queen w.
-PRON- be small with a_few table outside
-PRON- would say that the tapas be more on the high price end and well of_course tapa sized
also the food be predominantly local with wild meat
-PRON- should say that the menu be not accommodate to those_who do_not eat pork
-PRON- would say that 9\/10 menu_item contain pork
that lead -PRON- to say that the waitress be not very familiar_with the menu which be somewhat concern
-PRON- grow_up in the family business
so -PRON- know that -PRON- be important that the waitress be knowledgeable of the menu_item fix item as_well_as seasonal
service be okay
food be good
-PRON- do_not get any good_than this_place -PRON- wish -PRON- have a location in the nw valley but -PRON- probably would not be as cool
-PRON- love the casual atmosphere have a rocky point feel to -PRON- and -PRON- usually get good service
when -PRON- be really busy
-PRON- just get -PRON- drink from the center bar and -PRON- be always fast
-PRON- be also not too_loud here when -PRON- be have a conversation like many_other place
price be not bad either just -PRON- favorite all around bar that seem always to be busy just because -PRON- be too cool
oh and the food be good too
auf der oberen empore be mediamarkt -PRON- be breuningerland gelegen
innen ca 30 sitzplätze vor dem si auf der empore ca
50 sitzplätze wobei die tische sehr nahe zusammen stehen
der kellner ist zackig das_essen wurde sehr zügig serviert
keine location für_ein rendezvous oder größer geschäftsessen für_ein fix mittagessen aber mehr al ok
do_not buy a timeshare from -PRON-
all -PRON- do be tell -PRON- lie to get -PRON- to buy from -PRON-
2 manager have tell -PRON- -PRON- would call -PRON- back and follow_up with -PRON- and neither of -PRON- have call back
sunny chuck and luis flores be full of bs and then -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- will put a reminder in -PRON- calendar to make_sure to call -PRON- back with a follow_up beware -PRON- also run -PRON- credit with out tell -PRON- until -PRON- be already be run and -PRON- go to the back to fill paperwork out
nothing but lie lie lie
horrible company stay_away
fantastic yorkville staple
sato be a legend still do -PRON- thing in stride
unless -PRON- be offend by dated sport memorabilia or fantastic sushi -PRON- will like this_place
menu be simple and well execute
fish be always fresh delicious and generously cut
everything from miso_soup to tempura be excellent
fresh honeydew and orange with -PRON- cheque
this review be for the pho and bun_bo_hue
after a fun night on the town and very little sleep a bowl of pho be the type_of comfort_food -PRON- need
the pho broth be ok but the flavor be not as rich and develop in comparison to other pho -PRON- have have
the bun_bo_hue be not very spicy and the broth taste thin without much depth or flavor
-PRON- recently visit restore before attend a cleveland indians baseball game
the staff be very_friendly and knowledgeable as -PRON- guide -PRON- through the different choice
-PRON- choose juice 1 -PRON- be outstanding
-PRON- highly_recommend -PRON- take the time to visit restore cold pressed
-PRON- will not be disappoint
nico be -PRON- favorite restaurant and -PRON- have be die to try the octopus from virtú for so long now and -PRON- finally try -PRON- amazing
-PRON- server jessica be very sweet and help -PRON- with the menu choice and give great recommendation
-PRON- miss the steak with cherry
that be a favorite but still love the other thing -PRON- try also
sticky toffee chocolate_cake have change since -PRON- use to go seem a_bit_more dry also still a favorite dessert though
-PRON- eat at fnb while visit scottsdale largely base_on the rave_review of -PRON- fellow yelpers
love the amazingly edit flavorful really interesting menu which -PRON- be sure change really often
this so could have be 5_star except other_than get -PRON- order and rush -PRON- out with the check -PRON- service be pretty
absent
although shout_out to the water boy who keep -PRON- hydrated
-PRON- other beef be about the b in the name
in -PRON- mind there would be some expectation of real drink option base_on the name alone
-PRON- be usually a fan_of byo but -PRON- think the corkage fee even for beer be inordinate and not keep with the spirit of the place
-PRON- love this target
-PRON- be always clean and well organize and the people be pretty friendly
-PRON- be way more pleasant to shop at then the local walmart
-PRON- would give -PRON- 5_star if -PRON- have a big good grocery section
love the food here
great breakfast
kimberly the hostess greet -PRON- with a smile and be awesome
-PRON- server on the other_hand be not so good
-PRON- be slow and never see -PRON- after the food be deliver
alejandr be busy talk and text instead_of get -PRON- food
drink be never refill and after wait for a long_time -PRON- finally go to the register and get -PRON- check
great food
bad service
love the smith center
see wicked and chris botti here
-PRON- be an_amazing facility with great seat great ambiance and great service
the secret be to go to the top floor grab a drink and step out in the balcony and look_at downtown
gorgeous
-PRON- love the fact_that -PRON- the local have a place that would rival the theater 's in la
the parking be even free
-PRON- highly highly_recommend see a show here at on of the local treasure in_las_vegas
$ 470mil well spend
-PRON- want a quick_bite for breakfast -PRON- be either this or the buffet at harrahs
-PRON- have the oatmeal and the fruit platter
-PRON- be surprisingly delicious
everything be fresh the oatmeal be not dry or clumpy
-PRON- be a happy camper
the seating situation in this_place be ridiculous
-PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- have a diner card and if -PRON- do_not -PRON- show -PRON- to something that resemble a cluster of people
-PRON- have_no_idea whose next where the end of the line or cluster be
-PRON- be really unorganized
so unorganized that -PRON- actually leave because -PRON- be confused
-PRON- go to check_out the buffet come_back to the cafe 5_minute later there be a new group_of people wait in the cluster and -PRON- skip -PRON- all because after all -PRON- be wait before
nobody notice anything nobody say anything -PRON- just cut in front of everyone
-PRON- be not complain
but -PRON- be what -PRON- be unorganized
all in all good cafe food a little overpriced but -PRON- be in_vegas
if -PRON- like over the top cheesy neon colour lighting over price sweet cocktail that do_not taste_like -PRON- have booze in -PRON- and very average food then -PRON- will be happy here
-PRON- kind_of feel_like -PRON- be walk on to the set of an ed hardy commercial except -PRON- be dead in there
one of the good burger place to go to in north carolina and also home to some great appetizer dessert and salad
-PRON- enjoy an_amazing three course meal at bad daddy 's ballantyne with great service
-PRON- waitress suggest try to bbq chicken nachos with grill pineapple that definitely live_up to -PRON- expectation and more
for -PRON- entree -PRON- try the frenchie sandwich with a turkey burger grill apple brie cheese bacon and more with sweet_potato_fry
-PRON- get -PRON- meal very quickly and -PRON- could tell everything be hot and fresh
for dessert -PRON- treat -PRON- to the peanut_butter pie
and oh -PRON- goodness
the pie crush taste_like a pb\/chocolate cookie and the filling be a mousse texture with chocolate drizzle on_top
typically pb brittle be serve on_top but -PRON- decide to not get that
on the other end of the spectrum -PRON- salad be also a great option with the greek be -PRON- favorite
overall a great experience
will_definitely go_back
the girl be great and the taro milk_tea be fantastic
-PRON- really like the experience

instead -PRON- order a sonogram to rule out any problem
-PRON- have this do one year_ago and -PRON- have to record of -PRON-
-PRON- be fine
and this be a first
but -PRON- could_not believe -PRON-
-PRON- be tell to skip across the hall into the office to have the sonogram
yes naked from the waist down

but that person have to grab -PRON- clothing and purse out of the room
-PRON- change back into -PRON- clothe in that office after that be do
-PRON- will now receive a hefty bill for this and know -PRON- insurance will not pick -PRON- up
-PRON- adore the nurse zane but dr. o be so young and
what make -PRON- mad be that -PRON- do_not even look_at -PRON- and -PRON- be due for a pap -PRON- tell -PRON- to wait until august
this sort_of thing never happen in the past
-PRON- have no desire to return
nice staff but -PRON- be turn_off by way_too many thing that day
gross out that -PRON- do_not even cover the foot rest in the stirrup
-PRON- be cover by what look_like used sock
-PRON- will not go_back
-PRON- friend and -PRON- trek out to corktown to grab brunch at morning glory only to discover -PRON- be close
this work out well in the end as -PRON- walk down a laneway and end_up at gilead cafe instead
this be yet another jamie kennedy restaurant
like -PRON- other venture this_place be excellent
despite be in a pretty unassuming light industrial building the interior of the restaurant be really nice
-PRON- do a great_job decorate the space and -PRON- have a lot_of character
the food be delicious
-PRON- friend and -PRON- have the poutine a grill_cheese sandwich and a spring salad and all of the dish be quite good
kennedy know_how to make fry and the poutine be really something_else
this_place be definitely_worth check_out again
five_star for this_place
-PRON- carry some cute stuff which always surprise -PRON-
the store be not the huge but -PRON- be big enough for -PRON- -PRON- think
-PRON- always can find what -PRON- want in this store
and the price be reasonable
some stuff be cheap_than toy r -PRON-
and the location be good for those people_who live around downtown toronto
-PRON- be easy_parking on the street
but the facade of the store be not that attractable -PRON- can_not find out that be a baby store if -PRON- just walk_through
-PRON- be randomly in mesa with two people_who also have no knowledge of mesa
-PRON- end_up here and -PRON- be fine but probably not the place -PRON- have in mind
red white and brew be like a glorified applebee 's
lot_of family lot_of wood booth
base off the name -PRON- be hop to be blow_away_by the beer_selection but -PRON- be pretty standard
maybe the real problem be that -PRON- server be a little odd
very_friendly but odd
-PRON- stand a little too close come over a little too often
one of the odder thing be that -PRON- snatch -PRON- full glass of water because there be no ice in -PRON- anymore
that have be intentional -PRON- do_not like ice in -PRON- water and have be wait for -PRON- to melt
again not ill intention but a little odd
-PRON- order the pita pizza appetizer and -PRON- be cold the cheese partially melt
meh
the main be all fine but again very comprable to an applebees
-PRON- do_not live anywhere near here but if -PRON- do -PRON- would not be back
overall a pretty great venue
-PRON- be set_up so -PRON- can see well from any seat in the house
plenty_of bar and restroom available which be nice for a venue this size
-PRON- always prefer a seat to standing room and the seat at the top do_not_disappoint
-PRON- could easily see even with all the seat in front of -PRON- fill
the sound guy do an_excellent job of ensure the instrument do_not drown out the vocal
what be even good be price be reasonable too
maximillion salon and spa offer an experienced and caring staff who listen to the client need
each stylist have 30 plus year experience and keep up with the current trend with on go education to give each client a fresh new look
rebecca rose and suzie be master colorists and stylist and have a true passion for the industry

-PRON- tell -PRON- monta be not all that
do_not get -PRON- wrong service be pretty_good actually
maybe too good
cuz -PRON- raman come_out within_minute of ordering
how be that even possible
do -PRON- have -PRON- pre_make in the back
and -PRON- be just microwave or something
-PRON- have very high hope for monta sadly
-PRON- will_never return
here be -PRON- reason 1
too_salty
and even if -PRON- ask for less salty you're still go to feel bloated as shizz from the sodium
2
noodle be no bueno
-PRON- be like thin vermicelli noodle
-PRON- like -PRON- raman noodle thick and with the right kinda chew
3

all in all -PRON- be a good meal and nice atmosphere
-PRON- can_not tell -PRON- how thankful -PRON- be to have find this_place
two year_ago when -PRON- move to az -PRON- husband buy -PRON- a beautiful michele watch and -PRON- need -PRON- size

but too_bad -PRON- do_not get a chance to come in on friday
the crowd -PRON- be rather unpleasant
a lot_of pushy people and rude
but this have nothing to do with the service or food
-PRON- personally like dragon pearl better because -PRON- be basically the same
but -PRON- get half a lobster
at $ 31.99 -PRON- be not a bad place to go for a special occassion
senior over 65 get 20 off -PRON- meal

original review
take -PRON- 2006 dodge charger daytona edition to get a quote for 2 motor mount
-PRON- be tell -PRON- be approximately $ 1,500
-PRON- never receive a call

-PRON- never call to tell -PRON- the price be go to go up
-PRON- say the part cost more how do part cost go up that quickly
let_alone why do_not anyone call -PRON- to confirm the new price before get start on -PRON- car
what if -PRON- do_not have the money
this_place be a rip_off and know -PRON- have a monopoly since -PRON- only competition be towbin which be bad
-PRON- will_never go there again
goodbye dodge -PRON- dealer be not honest
what be say be -PRON- be try to get honest dealer work because -PRON- want to save this vehicle to hold as a classic
would not recommend and very_disappointed in -PRON- inability to call -PRON-
this_place have the best iced latte -PRON- have have in a long_time and the barista be not pretentious and too cool to be nice to -PRON-
-PRON- even fill_up -PRON- 64 oz water for -PRON- since -PRON- be head to red rock after
-PRON- be so sweet and the espresso be so delicious
-PRON- wish this_place exist in -PRON- city
the food be good but expect more from all fuss people be make
the wait kill -PRON-
-PRON- be quote an_hour
so -PRON- walk_around and come_back
-PRON- wait a total of 1_hour 20_minute and be seat just as -PRON- be walk_out
when -PRON- come_back -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be the next table of three but find -PRON- seat other before -PRON-
have to complain twice to make_sure -PRON- be really next
-PRON- also forget -PRON- biscuit and scone
but the waiter give -PRON- one for free even_though -PRON- cancel the order
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go to scarpetta on -PRON- recent anniversary trip
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- start out with the scallop appetizer and -PRON- be great delicious and cook_perfectly
-PRON- husband have the spaghetti and -PRON- have the stracci
both dish be delicious
-PRON- end the night with a gingerbread pear crisp with cinnamon ice_cream
everything have be great
to make the night even better the service be the good -PRON- could ask for
-PRON- waiter be attentive and knowledgeable
-PRON- will_definitely be back when -PRON- go to vegas again
hidden_gem one of the good chinese spot in_town better then pf chang in quality and value
hot as in turn on the a\/c
holy swamp ball batman
this be one of -PRON- stop via nite tours
and -PRON- wish this be not one of -PRON-
the music be good but -PRON- be crowd and there be about to be a throw down near -PRON-
-PRON- do_not want -PRON- kick to get mess_up
so -PRON- snitch on -PRON- and have security diffuse the tension
drink price avg $_12 14 decor be cool upstairs and -PRON- be really not feel the crowd at all
this be -PRON- second_visit
the first be in the evening with a wait
this time be lunch with no wait
the food be good but not amazing
-PRON- split a jerk turkey burger which be of ample size and tasty
-PRON- also split the cauliflower side
thought -PRON- be a bit_overpriced for the size
the caesar_salad be excellent but again a_bit small for the portion_size
come on lettuce
with so_much competition nearby -PRON- need to up -PRON- game a_bit
much potential
-PRON- love mediterranean food and good service
this restaurant be neither especially the latter
-PRON- have work at a 5 star\/5 diamond restaurant but have -PRON- favorite hole_in the wall no star joint with excellent service and quality food
will_never step foot into this restaurant again
no customer_service no one greet -PRON- as -PRON- wait at the podium for 10_minute and server keep pass_by and food be mediocre
do_not taste authentic and food be overprice
not recommend
first_time at this_place
unbelievable staff
very_friendly
great food
would_recommend to other people
-PRON- be go to do -PRON- good to describe the meal -PRON- just have at tako but -PRON- certainly will not do -PRON- justice
suffice -PRON- to say -PRON- be one of the most perfect experience din out that -PRON- have have in a long long_time
-PRON- know come in to not over order taco like -PRON- do the last_time which put -PRON- in good shape
to start -PRON- have the classic guacamole and the poke appetizer
the guacamole be as good as the last_time with some homemade still warm tortilla chip
the poke
one of the good appetizer -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- be serve with a spicy soy dressing whip lime and guacamole which -PRON- be not expect
-PRON- eat -PRON- over some rice cracker and -PRON- melt_in -PRON- mouth
for -PRON- taco -PRON- decide on the bistec and the special korean fry_chicken which be both incredible
the couple next to -PRON- overorder like -PRON- do on or first_visit -PRON- could see -PRON- in -PRON- face immediately
-PRON- be drink beer and a cucumber margarita that have -PRON- wife salivating
after dinner -PRON- have a pour -PRON- reposado to go with -PRON- sangrita
-PRON- do_not have sangrita last_time -PRON- be here so -PRON- be glad -PRON- add -PRON- to the menu as -PRON- manager promise
which lead -PRON- to dessert
fresh cheesecake serve in a bowl with vanilla ice_cream fresh berry and a lime strawberry sauce
-PRON- be not even that big on cheesecake but once_again perfection
-PRON- do_not have any crust or crunch element but the fresh berry and mint be fantastic
-PRON- be a special_occasion but the bill be only $_100 which for what -PRON- get be incredibly reasonable
-PRON- book the reservation 3_week in_advance so plan_ahead of -PRON- want an_early enough reservation
-PRON- definitely cater to couple of two as_oppose to party
the hotel be get a little dated
-PRON- be locate right next_door to the new arena be build which would be great once complete
there be several other construction project that make walk the strip a little difficult on this side of the street
the hotel wifi be only available on the first 2 floor which be lousy these day
-PRON- bathtub faucet drip all night and the fixture could have be a little nice
the shower head be very low for someone 6 tall
the food be decent overall for the price point this be a 3 of 5
-PRON- use to love serrano 's
-PRON- be definitely -PRON- go to mexican_restaurant
however the last several_time -PRON- go the service be poor
-PRON- appear as if -PRON- need more server
-PRON- waiter be slow or too_busy to attend to -PRON- table
the food be good
the salsa be great and -PRON- be nice to get the bean dip as_well
overall -PRON- would still recommend -PRON- if -PRON- be not in a hurry
-PRON- have never have great experience at_this_location but never feel_like -PRON- be worth -PRON- to write a review but tonight 's experience push -PRON- over the edge
-PRON- mom and -PRON- go to subway because -PRON- be one of the quick place to eat around that be still open
-PRON- walk_in at 9:30 and -PRON- close at 10
-PRON- feel_like that give -PRON- enough time to
and -PRON- be not go in right before -PRON- close
well the employee must have think differently because -PRON- be give -PRON- attitude from the get go
one of the lady be at_least try to be pleasant but the other one be not whatsoever
-PRON- act as if -PRON- walk_into the store be a huge inconvenience to -PRON- and the fact_that -PRON- stay and eat there make -PRON- even bad
but what make -PRON- even worse be that while -PRON- be eat -PRON- turn_off the front light so only the back counter light be on and -PRON- lock the front_door before -PRON- be even closed
if -PRON- be closed and -PRON- stay past -PRON- operating hour -PRON- would understand such treatment but consider -PRON- lock the door and turn the light off while -PRON- be suppose to be open be both bad business and super inconsiderate to those that be still in the store
-PRON- be infuriate by -PRON- poor_customer_service
what a great collection
-PRON- visit the rom to see -PRON- darwin exhibit which be incredible
not only be the collection huge -PRON- be display in a way that do_not overload -PRON-
-PRON- other favorite be -PRON- egyptian collection
-PRON- have a whole wall mural that be spectacular
-PRON- do_not recall all of the permanent collection but the museum have vast collection that could take hour to take -PRON-
-PRON- can_not wait to go_back and view the rest
parking be not difficult and the tim_horton 's across the street be a great place to grab a bite while take a rest
bomb.com but 1hour wait fk that
with all the $_$ -PRON- make -PRON- need to expand the place
poor service mgr would not accept criticism when tell waiter to charge for bad order good food bad attitude need service improvement
this be -PRON- go to place in gilbert when -PRON- want to grab dinner
-PRON- be close by and the food be always hot and delicious
-PRON- personally like the buffalo chicken wrap and the burger
-PRON- family frequently get the rib and the monte cristo
only 4_star because sometimes the service be not be the best-
but -PRON- be never be horrible
-PRON- elderly mother be twice conveniently cancel for -PRON- initial checkup by the dr 's office
doctor apparently have surgery often on thursdays and -PRON- do_not hesitate to cancel without warn
-PRON- call twice the day before
now -PRON- have to scramble to get -PRON- mother another doctor as this one be just too unreliable for appointment
love these_guy love the double decker
quality pie nice staff good price
come_here eat pizza make friend
the one good thing_about this_place be -PRON- be always consistent the bad thing be -PRON- be always a consistently not good
the margaritas be so so the food be so so and so be the service this time -PRON- luck out and get an adequate server
most of the staff be poorly dress and unkempt
make_sure to order -PRON- next cocktail way before -PRON- first be finish so -PRON- get -PRON- in time
the kicker the state of the restaurant -PRON- be dirty unkept and in desperate need of a face lift or at the very least a fresh coat of paint and pressure wash
a friend that be with -PRON- state that -PRON- be because college kid do_not care_about the environment that -PRON- eat in
look around
-PRON- point out the family and say that if -PRON- appeal to the family and the corporate office in the area -PRON- may have a good environment for guest and staff
so why do -PRON- keep go_back
-PRON- be never -PRON- choice
-PRON- only go at the request of other and do_not recommend -PRON- to anyone
have -PRON- contact -PRON- about poor device issue
yes management have reach out to -PRON- in the past but with each visit -PRON- be clear to -PRON- that guest feedback do_not effect how -PRON- run -PRON- business
the good news -PRON- be america and -PRON- can run -PRON- however
-PRON- choose and as long as -PRON- be in the black -PRON- be not go to do anything to change
can_not argue_with that logic -PRON- suppose
-PRON- would suggest -PRON- jimaca summer salad though the dressing be the thing that make -PRON- great
but -PRON- be go to be on the hunt for jimaca for -PRON- salad at home
-PRON- will just keep go to fuzzy 's for -PRON- mexican_food and entertain -PRON- friend at cafe boa
suck to put -PRON- lightly
shame on the tropicana concierage for arrange this crappy service
this business should be name bell trans shuttle disservice
late late late
always late read the other_review
a complete waste of time and money
never refund -PRON- for a shuttle that never show
if -PRON- be on the southern part of the strip save -PRON- the time frustration hassle and discomfort and just take a cab for a_few buck more
-PRON- will probably end_up not want to miss -PRON- flight and cabb -PRON- anyway
great new shop super fresh food
open_kitchen and sup friendly_staff
food be quite delicious and fast and the price be reasonable
the food be good enough -PRON- have to add this business to yelp

overall great atmosphere -PRON- recommend completely
-PRON- aunt get food from pedro 's almost_every week and when -PRON- can drag -PRON- to that side of town -PRON- always eat_here
-PRON- be here last_week for dinner and have a delightful cheese crisp truly the good invention ever as_an_appetizer
-PRON- usually order -PRON- combo with chicken taco but decide to order a chicken burro this time
-PRON- burro plate come with a burro no sauce and rice and bean
the burro be decent beware -PRON- chicken be cook in a sauce so if -PRON- be not a fan_of sauce -PRON- may catch -PRON- off guard
-PRON- like -PRON- though
-PRON- like the bean but -PRON- rice lack something
the rest_of -PRON- food be really good
-PRON- mom always get the shredded_beef burro enchilada style with green sauce and -PRON- be delicious
lot_of shredded_beef
bottom_line this_place have be here forever and be always pack
that should speak volume as there be a milion restaurant in this city
if -PRON- be in glendale go to pedro 's
-PRON- have have many massage throughout -PRON- adult life in different state country include cruise ship
-PRON- do_not write this to sound_like -PRON- be some expert on massage but to let -PRON- know this be by_far one of the good massage -PRON- have experience
miriam 's technique and the feeling of complete euphoria far exceed the trendy massage parlor or hotel spa
-PRON- be a true artist and -PRON- be truly grateful to have find miriam
-PRON- have live in_las_vegas for six year and -PRON- get a massage approximately once a month
miriam be now -PRON- go to masseuse

such an easy airport to fly in or out of
food option be improve and there have be some awesome update in the security area
finally -PRON- make -PRON- back here after a first fail attempt over 8 year_ago
-PRON- love love -PRON- happy_hour deal although -PRON- have the lavender lemon drop which be delicious
the slider taco and brie platter be awesome at just $_3 a pop
-PRON- think the margarita be also $_3
-PRON- can_not wait to come_back and bring -PRON- in law
-PRON- know -PRON- will love the setting and ambiance
such a beautiful place
awesome thai food make fresh to order
hawaiian food be excellent and the mac salad be legit
thai hawaiian fusion food place
mom and pop run store real local hawaiians touch of aloha and genuine care go into the food
-PRON- offer thai hot on the scale rating if -PRON- dare
can_not say enough of how good this_place be
this be truly a classy restaurant san the feeling of snooty claustrophobia
the wait staff be attentive the wine_list be impressive and the food devine
-PRON- have the bison and tuna and both meal be artistically present and season to perfection
-PRON- -PRON- will be back
-PRON- can throw a rock and hit a supplement store in this town but most of -PRON- do_not have the great pricing and selection as vdn
-PRON- be that person whip out -PRON- cell_phone and price check everything and -PRON- be actually pretty rare to find anything cheap even on amazon
selection be pretty thorough- from liquid amino and pb2 powder in the food area ample pre workout and bcaa and natural vitamin and a whole back wall of refrigerator -PRON- have not even look_at yet
staff be cool about check in on -PRON- or let -PRON- know where to find something
bonus_point for have a clearance section front right corner by the meal prep bag and offer a sample station to try featured product and flavor to help in the decision make process
other_review indicate that -PRON- give out free sample at checkout but so_far -PRON- have not see any-
maybe -PRON- discontinue this practice
-PRON- know the expression about sailor have a woman in every port
well on -PRON- recent_trip to the usa -PRON- have yelper in every town to host entertain and amuse
vegas elite dennis t be -PRON- lunch companion when -PRON- be in_town
not only be -PRON- gracious enough to clear some time in -PRON- busy schedule to have lunch with -PRON-
but -PRON- be honour that -PRON- make -PRON- meal together -PRON- 100th review dennis give -PRON- a list of tempting option for lunch
-PRON- have to watch how_much -PRON- be go to have for lunch as -PRON- have a dinner reservation at raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster slider at delmonico catch -PRON- eye so that be -PRON- choice
-PRON- have a nice time wander through the venetian on -PRON- way to delmonico
the size and scale of u.s. building in_general amaze -PRON- but the venetian be certainly very ornate and -PRON- enjoy look_at the menu while walk down restaurant row on the way to delmonico -PRON- instantly recognise dennis from -PRON- yelp picture and like all the yelper -PRON- have meet
conversation flow like -PRON- be old friend
so_much so that unusually for yelper -PRON- be chat so_much that ordering take_awhile as -PRON- have not look_at the menu the first few_time that -PRON- waiter approach to take -PRON- order
the restaurant be certainly deck out to appeal to the high_end of customer
-PRON- be a quiet lunch service when -PRON- din and while -PRON- provide a good ambiance for chat -PRON- perhaps do_not see delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that -PRON- be
-PRON- have already decide on -PRON- main_course of lobster slider and use -PRON- personal rule of take the opportunity of eat food that -PRON- do_not come_across often -PRON- pair that with an appetiser of traditional new_orleans gumbo
-PRON- be not in any position to comment_on the authenticity of the gumbo but as emeril lagasse start -PRON- celebrated celebrity chef trail with -PRON- first restaurant emeril 's in new_orleans -PRON- be guess -PRON- can cook a good gumbo
-PRON- be certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock
be asian -PRON- be also impressed to see that the rice have be cook well dennis be pleased_with -PRON- appetiser of lobster_bisque follow_by caesar_salad
-PRON- may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse
however -PRON- have always like the sound of lobster roll but still have not try one yet
-PRON- see these lobster slider as the near -PRON- could get until -PRON- make -PRON- trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll
well the slider be excellent soft roll contain morsel of sweet lobster meat mix with the right_amount_of mayonnaise and seafood dressing
dennis however be not quite as lucky with -PRON- fillet steak which arrive look rather lonely on the plate
dennis decide to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness
but -PRON- take a long_time to appear
and when -PRON- do -PRON- seem a_bit watery
in an effort to not be too piggy dennis and -PRON- split the banana cream pie
well the combination of banana pie whip_cream caramel and chocolate shaving please -PRON- palate probably more_than -PRON- artery
-PRON- do_not have a really sweet_tooth
but -PRON- really_enjoy
this dennis be kind_enough to give a lift back to -PRON- hotel down the strip which give -PRON- a good touristy view of the sight
a friendship seal
a celebrity chef tick off
lobster slider consume
a most successful lunch rendezvous indeed

-PRON- have eat_here a_few time
and -PRON- have think the pizza be pretty_good
-PRON- have order those time just pepperoni and simple stuff like that
tonight however be different
laura look on the menu and order a specialty half uno deluxe and half chicken bbq
-PRON- be starve and when -PRON- see that pizza box open up -PRON- be not let down when -PRON- bite_into that deluxe
at that moment -PRON- quite literally feel -PRON- be good piece_of pizza -PRON- have have in year
the sausage be so good
-PRON- then continue eat and eat a piece_of the chicken bar bbq
-PRON- know at that moment -PRON- would be write a review later
high_quality and great customer_service
thank -PRON- caleb and team
horrible employee
when -PRON- call in to place a balloon order -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- need to come in
when -PRON- come in -PRON- give -PRON- a disgust look and tell -PRON- there be an_hour wait
really
-PRON- employee have no type_of customer_service_skill nor do -PRON- have the will or tact to serve -PRON- customer
-PRON- need to retrain or hire new employee who be eager to serve -PRON- customer the reason_why -PRON- have a paycheck
this would be the rainbow 215 store
-PRON- have be awhile since -PRON- have be to woodlot or hear much about -PRON- but -PRON- be happy to report -PRON- be still incredibly tasty food and a great experience\/ too notch service
most affordable dining_option
no but great food and a lovely special night out
this review be slightly delay so -PRON- be still on the tail end of -PRON- winter menu
-PRON- advice at woodlot be try to order a_few small_plate so -PRON- can try a_few different thing
-PRON- also have a full veggie menu and a full meat menu so regardless who -PRON- be din with -PRON- will have some choice
-PRON- dinner companion and -PRON- start with grill hen o the wood mushroom and roasted winter squash dish which have pomegranate seed cheese and who know_what else deliciousness
both dish be flavourful and rich
-PRON- companion do_not actually like squash or mushroom that much but enjoy both
for -PRON- main -PRON- have a half order of smoke crab agnolotti
good to note
-PRON- can do half order of any pasta
the smoke crab make -PRON- kind_of light and delicate and -PRON- be really good
-PRON- dining companion have pork_chop which also get top mark
weirdly the only food item that fall a little short be the bread
while -PRON- wood oven cook sourdough be still good -PRON- be a_bit of a let down to have -PRON- cold
but that be an_extra and just bread so still a 5_star meal
good wine_selection with some reasonably_price glass
decent beer_selection but not on_tap
service be attentive and knowledgeable without be annoying
-PRON- make a reservation and -PRON- be in the upstairs area
-PRON- be cozy
will go_back and have some french_onion_soup -PRON- have have -PRON- on a precious trip to woodlot and -PRON- be delish
every_time -PRON- come with an_appointment -PRON- never touch -PRON- car until 30 50 minute_later
-PRON- have -PRON- car check and -PRON- say -PRON- need -PRON- engine mount and -PRON- serpentine belt replace
take -PRON- somewhere_else
turn_out -PRON- serpentine belt do_not need to be replace
when the other location have -PRON- repair -PRON- run smooth than ever before
rate here seem high_than other place
-PRON- quote -PRON- almost $_1000
meanwhile the other location be so happy to do -PRON- at $ 500
-PRON- feel as if this_place be dishonest so -PRON- will probably not be come_here again
-PRON- have all 4 tire replace here
make -PRON- wonder_if -PRON- even need -PRON-
-PRON- wifi never work and -PRON- get poor cell service in this building
good_luck waiting
-PRON- be the contractor that -PRON- home warranty company hook -PRON- up with
and -PRON- think -PRON- do very good job
-PRON- be tell -PRON- would show_up between 3 and 6 but bob be delay and do_not make -PRON- until 7:30
-PRON- do call to let -PRON- know -PRON- be run_late
-PRON- call at 6:30 but at_least -PRON- call
end_up be a minor issue fortunately
-PRON- would definitely use -PRON- again
the good independent rental shop in all of toronto this store locate_in church wellesley village have a great selection of title when compare to the rogers plus store locate down the street on wellesley street east
with an_adult section a great selection of documentary and independent film and many use rental on sale -PRON- can_not beat this_place when look for the right film to watch on any give night
unreal how amazing a job -PRON- do for -PRON- car
make a 5_year old car that have be rough up by dog and gardening equipment over the year look brand_new
amazing
-PRON- will_definitely be go_back there religiously
really bad for a pub and grill
gordon should be careful of where -PRON- name go
-PRON- need to visit this_place and kick someone rear
appetizer be good salmon and scotch egg
the main_course be well
the christmas holiday prime_rib meal
only prime be cost for a bad cut of meat fatty and bad
the yorkshire pudding taste_like well nothing just like dough
the only good thing be the cold beer
wish -PRON- would have spend -PRON- $ 100.00 elsewhere on a good meal just have an_appetizer and a beer
a polish platter and a yuengl beer equal happiness
-PRON- really be a family bar
there be a sign on the door caution -PRON- not to swear and a large picture of pope john paul ii over the bar as_well_as year round christmas light illuminate -PRON- holiness
-PRON- have see many a father and young son eat polish platter while dad sip a longneck and sonny boy have an ibc root beer to try to be like dad
as close to christmas eve as_possible this_place even have a polish christmas carol night
steer clear of the duck blood soup though
-PRON- do_not try -PRON- but -PRON- dad say -PRON- be nothing like what -PRON- grandmother make
-PRON- dare -PRON- to try -PRON- but the iron smell of blood soup or blood pudding
-PRON- just can_not do -PRON-
also while the bbt do make a fine pierogi -PRON- do_not think -PRON- be the good pierogi in pittsburgh
st. john 's in the south side or visitation in Mount pleasant be just as good or good
horrible incompetent disorganized a big waste of time
not to mention sooooo unprofessional to say the least the doc even call -PRON- and say -PRON- be hold -PRON- husband prescription unless -PRON- come_back in for a follow_up on the same contact -PRON- have wear for year
then -PRON- hang_up_on -PRON-
i be amazed -PRON- be still in business
save -PRON- the time frustration and trouble
go to 20\/20 image down the street way good experience
wish -PRON- have go there first

-PRON- be prompt and professional

reminiscent of the classic deli back on li
-PRON- go to give this airport 4_star not because -PRON- love -PRON- but because of how_much -PRON- appreciate the work that go into the efficiency of this_place
-PRON- be a very very busy airport and -PRON- be full of the clueless flier ilk which can slow down the process of get through the airport
fortunately -PRON- be armed with a priority screening pass
anyway everytime -PRON- see the line at security -PRON- heart sink
yet -PRON- seem to never take more_than 15_20 minute
contrast with the efficiency of say john wayne in orange county where -PRON- can expect 45_minute on a normal day -PRON- would say this be pretty painless
on the other end -PRON- do a head count of the head in the cab line on a recent_trip
-PRON- stop at 1000
yes one thousand
get -PRON- cab in 30_minute
-PRON- be a long_time to wait -PRON- know but 1,000 people serve in 30_minute
let -PRON- see mcdonald_'s match that
the southwest terminal where -PRON- hang be crowd and have few amenity one restaurant unless -PRON- count the prezel and fast_food place as amenity
sbarro echh
if -PRON- have money leave over spend -PRON- here on oxygen penny slot tacky jewelry and other trinket and trash
there be also a_bit of confusion on the gate where to line up and such particularly around the gate at the end of the terminal
still -PRON- admire the people_who work there who have to deal with las_vegas tourist perhaps the bad in the us and give -PRON- 4_star for effort
especially the southwest airlines crew
nathan and team have be care for -PRON- home for several month
-PRON- team be reliable and take great care of the property with little input from -PRON-
palm trim water system maintenance and all the rest

butterfish be great
the pear salad just the right mix
and -PRON- dessert put together beautifully
desert canyon be still a fav of the guy -PRON- golf with and -PRON- always make a time to play there when -PRON- be in_town
the course be in good condition as always and the staff be great to deal with
the only down side be the pace of play which as some tee can be very frustrating and consume
when -PRON- get the while be young idea into the course -PRON- will be one of the good all round course for the price
-PRON- order food for 40 people this_past_weekend and when -PRON- get there to pick -PRON- up

-PRON- be a brown ugly color and not green
all the food be waaaaaay too_salty and -PRON- be very embarrassed by -PRON-
-PRON- will_never order from somburros ever again
-PRON- pay_$ 2.50 for 5 piece_of hush puppy that be too hard
the sweet_tea be delish perfect for a hot summer day
food be excellent
all fresh_ingredient and worth the money
service be just a good and consistently impressive
highly_recommend the garlic_knot
place never_disappoint
really bad location
-PRON- always get -PRON- order wrong or try to hand -PRON- someone_else 's stuff at the window or attempt to give -PRON- someone_else 's total at the window before that
-PRON- have get a stale wrap or a hard bun on many occasion
the last_time -PRON- go the old asian woman tell be that -PRON- can_not punch a bacon mcdouble dress like a mac into -PRON- computer so -PRON- can only give -PRON- a mcdouble dress like a mac but with bacon
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have have -PRON- here before many_time and suggest -PRON- ask another employee to help -PRON- figure_out the computer

crap service be the norm
this just really piss -PRON- off
-PRON- coulda ask for help

-PRON- would definitely eat_here again
-PRON- hope these_guy do well
-PRON- would love to have a japanese restaurant closer to work
but the competition around s. tryon
shopton rd be too stiff
some change to the menu will be require
at the moment the menu only have hibachi grill style item and a total of three sushi item
the current promotion be buy one get one free meaning -PRON- spend_$ 6 a piece
not bad when discount but not good at the regular price
-PRON- would_rather go down the street to fortune cookie ii
-PRON- be a great idea with some potential but with the current menu and price -PRON- be sad to say pika japanese will not be around too_long
-PRON- want to love mirch masala
-PRON- really do
-PRON- tend_to hate buffet as -PRON- love -PRON- food prepare to order
in this case the food actually have pretty_good taste and flavor

good location
-PRON- be locate next to the planet hollywood hotel and the miracle mile shop
so there be a lot_of shopping and dining_option locate right downstairs

good price in_town
great staff
first_time there this morning service be a little_slow apparently a waitress call in sick
food come_out quick ham steak and egg for -PRON- and french_toast for -PRON- wife
everything be super delicious the 12 grain toast -PRON- get with -PRON- breakfast be some of the good toast -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- only have one complaint jelly selection poor and brand be cheap
-PRON- need to step -PRON- up in that department
other_than_that sound_like this be a new find breakfast restaurant for -PRON-
-PRON- will be back soon
this brand_new hotel be beautiful clean but very small quiet and cater to asian to an extreme so_much so that -PRON- play only chinese music all day
everything be in english and chinese -PRON- be in a really bad unsafe part of town the window be tint pink which be weird
the pool be tiny only a little big than the pool in -PRON- backyard and there no jacuzzi
all the drink be chinese
there be mostly asian people there and casino next_door be chinese as_well
no american game like craps
the people at the restaurant look_at -PRON- funny like -PRON- do_not belong and the food be not that good to -PRON- either
-PRON- be extreme so beware
if -PRON- be not look for authentic asian place and -PRON- want the true american las_vegas experience don't stay_here
-PRON- miss the excalibur so -PRON- check_out and go_back there
so_much happy for the same price
bad bar in cleveland
this be the type_of place that make -PRON- not want to go downtown again
the service be horrible
the staff be rude
most of the time the resort restaurant be expensive and okay tasting
while the price for here at resort level -PRON- can get away with some credit towards breakfast as a globalist hyatt member
the breakfast have a good selection of some savory and sweet item
the plus here be everything be a la_carte and freshly make even some condiment like -PRON- jam
-PRON- come late for breakfast one day and -PRON- become the timing for the weekend brunch
-PRON- be glad -PRON- miss out on breakfast because the brunch be phenomenal
for $_60 per_person -PRON- can get 1 starter 1 main dish 1 mimosa savory buffet and dessert buffet
let -PRON- tell -PRON- the savory buffet have some great item like crab and shrimp
if -PRON- be a seafood fan -PRON- will get more_than -PRON- money 's worth

which be unheard of in this industry
-PRON- nail_technician take -PRON- time and do_not pry into -PRON- business with -PRON- small talk
if -PRON- can pick this shop and bring every aspect of -PRON- to san_francisco with -PRON- -PRON- totally would

all lump crab and cheese no filler none
here be a rundown of everything -PRON- have have
on the dinner menu appetizer first let -PRON- say this

for entree -PRON- have have the follow blacken heart of ribeye good filet_mignon medium good just for the halibut good but not a fan_of the potato cake as -PRON- get mushy under the fish lump crab_cake good
but -PRON- have filler and be on the small side rack of lamb be bomb
very good shrimp and grit very good braise short_rib very good and the shrimp and lobster linguini which be no_longer on the menu but be very good
also -PRON- can_not go_wrong_with the mac_n_cheese and the dessert
-PRON- have to give -PRON- to dressler 's bc
-PRON- have always take good care of -PRON- crew
and -PRON- the food be very good
not for the museum or the exhibit
-PRON- be in_town for a conference and one of the reception\/cocktail hour
be at the top floor of the mint museum and -PRON- get to say -PRON- be a beautiful spot for this sort_of event
at the top floor -PRON- get a beautiful view of the city westin duke energy nascar building
-PRON- be not that high up
but -PRON- still offer a bird 's eye view
the patio area be spacious and the ballroom be big enough to hold quite a_bit of -PRON- there
of_course food be cater as_well_as the bar since -PRON- doubt the museum have a full kitchen
-PRON- be just sad that -PRON- do_not get to check_out the museum for -PRON-
-PRON- be not an expert on art especially modern art but -PRON- be always neat and enlightening to see thing from other 's point of view and dive into the psyche of -PRON- creation
overall this space be gorgeous and spacious
lot_of people clamor how great -PRON- be and definitely leave a big impression on all the outside towner
while the gerber collision glass company be amazing john bernie ruth and the rest_of the team at the hampton location in mesa be absolutely unparalleled in -PRON- customer_service attention to detail communication throughout the process and quality of work
if -PRON- could give six star -PRON- absolutely would
high reccomendation for any car\/glass repair
-PRON- go here for a work event one time
be a pretty_good experience
the waitress be very_friendly and knowledgeable -PRON- name be acacia in case someone read this give -PRON- credit
this_place have a great beer_selection and carry one of -PRON- favorite left hand brewery milk stout
the appetizer and dessert be very good
-PRON- have the creme_brulee at the waitress recommendation and -PRON- compliment -PRON- beer perfectly
definitely_worth check_out
be very well make
also another good beer to try here be the young 's double chocolate stout be pretty solid
only_downside i could see for some people be the pricing for drink could add up quick however i do_not so_much mind pay a high price for a good brew and nice environment
in_term_of cleveland area yacht club edgewater be one of the good
located right_next to edgewater metropark the location be top_notch

but really the good stuff
-PRON- do junior sail teams and race camps which -PRON- totally love

-PRON- come in due_to abdominal pain and -PRON- be very_attentive
-PRON- see -PRON- as_soon_as -PRON- register at check in

-PRON- do all need exam in less_than an_hour
and -PRON- be probably in the er for a total of 2.5 hour top which be actually really quick
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- will find good care elsewhere at any_other hospital here in_vegas
-PRON- highly_recommend this_place to anyone seek emergency medical attention
as_soon_as -PRON- walk_into this_place -PRON- fall in love with the ambiance
-PRON- be obvious a lot_of love go into this_place
everything be clean and nicely arrange not just shove on shelf to be forget
the only problem with this_place be that because of the size there be just not a lot_of clothing which be what -PRON- usually come for
what -PRON- do have at_least in the plus size seem to be all winter item
-PRON- do have some super_cute dress and such in small size
price be reasonable
the art gallery upstairs be super_cute
see a lot_of way overprice junk and a lot_of cute reasonably_price stuff
-PRON- be nice to take a look_at
who know there could be good sushi in the desert
hachi do -PRON- right
the service be great and both the waiter and the chef be extraordinary in accomodat -PRON- gluten_free need
kobe_beef sashimi be worth -PRON-
peyote roll be delish
even the cucumber_salad be fancy
this be one thing -PRON- do_not want to stay in_vegas
sure -PRON- be pricy for sushi when -PRON- consider the normal price for thing on the east_coast where fish be easy to come by but this be one place -PRON- would definitely_come_back to during -PRON- next vegas visit
unexpectedly great which be the main_reason -PRON- get 5_star
-PRON- stay_here for a couple day midweek when -PRON- regular hotel be sell out
the price be right and i like to stay downtown
check in and out be simple and straight_forward
-PRON- be on the 19th floor so sometimes -PRON- would have to wait for a while for the elevator but that be to be expect
-PRON- room be big clean and comfortable
well appoint
but -PRON- could have use some more outlet
-PRON- do_not gamble here so i can_not comment_on that

but the past 8 month -PRON- be like the entire company change
claim be always mess_up
-PRON- take -PRON- 3_week to get around to even start to process a claim
claim be deny because of -PRON- mistake and -PRON- take multiple phone_call and email to get -PRON- to make correction
-PRON- give -PRON- 2_star because -PRON- be good in the past
if -PRON- be rat -PRON- on the past 8 month alone -PRON- would be 0_star
price be always comparable to -PRON- typical exxon or shell station
if near matthews -PRON- be good to utilize -PRON- membership and purchase gas here as -PRON- be decent gas at a decent price
-PRON- tend_to plan -PRON- costco shopping trip around -PRON- gas need only if -PRON- do_not go to sc for gas beforehand
the customer_service at the station be pretty legit -PRON- have have some exceptional people work on day -PRON- have visit and -PRON- have have some people_who barely want to be there and just there for the check with no personality at all but all in all
-PRON- be good for what -PRON- be for = gas
overall the food be fantastic
would have give a 5 but the kid chicken_finger be pretty dry
the brisket and smoked chicken be excellent
the kid macaroni and cheese be the good thing on the table
drive 5 1\/2_hour from covina and wait 1 1\/2 to get
seat
order a deep_dish and say another 1 1\/2 wait
ridiculous will not come baxk
justin and jon make a great team
-PRON- be very efficient do_not oversell deliver on everything -PRON- propose and have the nice group_of folk work for -PRON-

-PRON- will be back again and again especially on those rare cold rainy day in lv
nice place
not fine_dining of_course
clean environment happy employee
have a good time can_not beat the price for the portion quality
-PRON- know everyone be a critic want $_1 well drink or giant kid meal but want to say this_place be just right
thank -PRON-
-PRON- know -PRON- wan't really like wow sushi
-PRON- be good good_than grocery_store sushi
-PRON- think -PRON- be expect better so -PRON- have to rate at 3_star because of the lack of motivation on go_back for more
always great food
breakfast be the good
the pancake be yummy and -PRON- mexican plate be so good
ever get that awkward feel -PRON- be look by the only 10 customer at a restaurant while -PRON- waiting to be seat
-PRON- feel_like forrest gump jump on the school bus for the first_time
-PRON- family and i decide to eat out at a place -PRON- actually never be to before and this be what -PRON- find
-PRON- forget what the fry be call but i have -PRON- vegas style
that and -PRON- raspberry vinaigrette toss salad be about the only_thing -PRON- have go for -PRON-
-PRON- entree for the night be drunken cajun chicken and be not the good choice ever
-PRON- be more spicy than anything
-PRON- mean yea
-PRON- say cajun but this be over cajun'ed to the point where there be no flavor
which i absolutely dislike
-PRON- cousin chicken_finger just have cheap barbecue sauce top over -PRON-
for the price the quality of food here be not great
this be the first_time i have ever have -PRON- appetizer actually taste better_than -PRON- actual main entree
good thing
-PRON- waitress be real professional and friendly or -PRON- would have be face a 1_star
very interesting place
-PRON- be call raman bar but -PRON- offer other asian soup noodle really
-PRON- get the japanese udon noodle with clear broth and -PRON- husband get the raman raman with spicy miso broth
to start_off -PRON- always get the chicken karaage
the chicken be definitely very tender and juicy inside but the outside be not crunchy enough for -PRON-
-PRON- feel a little too oily from the outside as_well
the noodle bowl be big and will fill -PRON- up
but the broth be not fantastic and the noodle be just too soft for -PRON-
the egg be good though -PRON- have the yolk a little runny stiff
normally -PRON- would rate carolinas much high in star except for today
-PRON- mean the food be good as_usual but the experience make -PRON- want scream
-PRON- let a patron with a dog in a food establishment
no no
no
not where -PRON- eat
-PRON- love dog and love -PRON- but would never consider take -PRON- in a restaurant
great friendly service with frank k or francisco
-PRON- get -PRON- deal for a mustang convertible through costco.com $ 227 for 7 day
the line be long but -PRON- be help in about_15 20 minuet
have -PRON- own car insurance
-PRON- get pricey for all the add on but frank never pressure -PRON- or make -PRON- feel obligate about the add on
-PRON- additional driver be free
-PRON- do hold $_200 on -PRON- account but honestly -PRON- current online bank statement do_not have -PRON- on there
-PRON- pay use -PRON- debit\/visa card
the review -PRON- read for this_location get -PRON- a little worried but -PRON- pray for favor everything go absolutely smoothly
-PRON- be very happy with -PRON- black mustang convertible -PRON- be -PRON- 1st time here in_vegas
-PRON- be a current member but not happy with the club
average food below_average sport club
-PRON- be super_excited to try this from a place because -PRON- favorite sandwich in the world may just be pastrami for a ribeye sandwich
-PRON- be a toss up but with pastrami in -PRON- name of -PRON- business -PRON- should be the great on earth or not -PRON- be good meat be a little cold
-PRON- be around 1 end of the lunch rush so may have be sit around for awhile slavery be good
just a little cold do_not like the bread taste a little old
still not_sure just very_friendly staff and for a pastrami sandwich -PRON- be on the cheap side
the pickled taste expire have a spit that out overall -PRON- be just ok may go_back back to try again at_least -PRON- do_not microwave -PRON- stuff like everyone -PRON- be in the steamer
this einstein 's have be here for year and -PRON- be always reliably good bagel bagel sandwich decent service and darn good coffee
-PRON- like some of -PRON- new menu addition in recent year such_as the spinach frittata
-PRON- really dig this_place
-PRON- would give -PRON- five_star but the food be very good but never hit excellent
also -PRON- last trip there which be a_few day_ago -PRON- have the pleasure of star at some dude ass crack who be sit in front of -PRON- at the bar
not oregano 's fault
but still there be some middle_aged wanna be hipster with 1980 's grunge greasy long hair
anyway on to the food
lately -PRON- have be order the pablo picasso hispanic orientated salad
-PRON- have be diet a little on the fat side lately
sometimes -PRON- get two bear claws wedge right in this spot
after some research -PRON- find without the dressing and corn chip -PRON- be not to bad on the calorie intake
also the flavor really be excellent the chicken be super well do
-PRON- be fajita style but maybe good
also note to one bartender stop charge -PRON- for soda water with a small amount_of lemonade and -PRON- will tip much good
oregano 's -PRON- will see -PRON- soon

be schlaf-

bäder sind sehr freundlich und zweckmäßig eingerichtet
wie gesagt die reinigung fand nur alle 2_3 tage statt handtücher wurden regelmäßig gewechselt aber den sand hatten wir ständig an den füßen kleben naja war ja unserer insofern ist das nicht ganz so eklig
in der lobby werden heißgetränke kostenlo zur verfügung gestellt
es gibt einen hauseigenen shop mit mikrowellenfood snacks und getränken
ausserdem verfügt da hotel über einen pool der trotz der abartig warman temperaturen sehr kühl ist
sofern man ein auto hat ist alle

kostenlose parkmöglichkeiten direkt vor dem hotel
-PRON- go there recently for the first_time
-PRON- have the chop brisket chicken pork plate
-PRON- be a huge plate for the side mac and cheese -PRON- be very good -PRON- will_definitely be back
crappy music
rude body guard
drink barely contain any alcohol
lame
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend change up the dj
-PRON- have potential
-PRON- be amazed at how this buffet put the wynn buffet to shame
-PRON- spend only $ 19.44 for 2 meal and
-PRON- wynn
yesterday -PRON- spend_$ 85.00
the food here be way good and real
mashed potato real and not powdered
definitely eat_here again
this_place have the good fast_food type burger
the grill onion be amazing
-PRON- always add avocado and love the whole grain bun -PRON- offer
-PRON- use romaine lettuce on -PRON- delicious dinner salad
-PRON- price be so reasonable and -PRON- staff be friendly and helpful
both time -PRON- visit -PRON- get -PRON- meal to go and -PRON- be excellent
when -PRON- be drunk everything taste good right
wrong
grant -PRON- be probably one of the very few drunk idiot that would actually waltz into a restaurant at damn near 2_a.m. and order a plate of asian style duck
really who do that
a grave mistake on -PRON- part and a horror that -PRON- have be try to forget
the flavor of the duck be only so so and the bok_choy be even less appealing
the only_thing -PRON- actually like about the dish be the plain white_rice and the apricot sauce
if -PRON- be not a frequent connoisseur of the water fowl a word to the wise those little bird have more bone than -PRON- can shake a stick at
as -PRON- be sure -PRON- can_imagine that spell frustration and near death for a drunk person_who be already far more likely to do something stupid like oh
-PRON- dunno
choke
so while the boyfriend enjoy every last bit of a heaping serving of spaghetti and meatball with garlic_bread -PRON- truly be stick dissect a weird bird that do_not even taste that great
just because -PRON- be drunk in the wee hour of the morning and desperate for food do_not try to be a cool kid like -PRON- and order some fancy sounding dish that will leave -PRON- unsatisfied
the only_thing bad than a hungry drunk be a drunk that be angry to boot
ok so -PRON- buy 2 night in groupon for this_place
-PRON- have the bad service ever
first of all check in be a nightmare
-PRON- tell -PRON- that check in time be go to be after 4 p.m. unless someone check_out early then -PRON- would be 11_a.m.
-PRON- keep call -PRON- once every hour since 8 a.m. that morning to check if there would be a room at_11_a.m.
that time come and -PRON- say that -PRON- can probably get check in at 12 p.m.
-PRON- call again around 11 ish
and then -PRON- be like
yeah
a room be ready come to the front
okay then -PRON- find out -PRON- be a groupon customer and -PRON- put -PRON- on hold
-PRON- get back to -PRON- and tell -PRON- that -PRON- do_not have a room and to wait until after 4
that be some s---
ok so -PRON- check in then -PRON- see that -PRON- get charge the full price plus the deposit and -PRON- apologize and say that -PRON- will put the money back
this ordeal take 45min
-PRON- be run_late to a show and -PRON- be really aggravate at this point
so finally -PRON- say that -PRON- put the money back except for the deposit
-PRON- look and the room charge be put back and so -PRON- think
okay so 2 day_later the charge plus the deposit appear again
wtf
so -PRON- call the bank
and -PRON- say that alexis resort do_not follow through on the credit be that -PRON- be only temporary
someone have to follow through but do_not
therefore basically -PRON- do_not do -PRON- job
and now -PRON- be out hundred of dollar
-PRON- have to call -PRON- and make -PRON- call the bank to actually get the refund back
the refund that should never have be charge plus the deposit\/hold money as_well
-PRON- be bs the s--- that -PRON- put -PRON- through
-PRON- will_never go there again
poor poor_customer_service
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give -PRON- no star
note this review be for the restaurant in the palazzo
-PRON- probably never would have come_here for dinner due_to the fact_that -PRON- have location in both the venetian(24 hr palazzo
that alone may lead -PRON- to assume that -PRON- be probably a_bit on the pricey side
actually -PRON- be surprisingly affordable in the $_$ price_range
gold marble metal finish amber color glass faint candle like lighting accent every inch of this palatial cafe
this_place be the classier better look sister restaurant to the cheesecake factory
if -PRON- be indecisive when -PRON- come to order -PRON- suggest -PRON- leave order to someone_else because the menu be an extensive 12 page or so of food drink dessert
there be so_much stuff here that there have definitely get to be something on the menu to palazzo yo azzo
from the thing to share or not menu asian nachos a scoop of spanish rice w\/ black_bean corn circle by 8 oversized piece_of crispy wonton style nacho chip
top with chicken peanut sweet spicy peanut creamy wasabi dressing
some piece could have go easier on peanut_sauce though
but the other piece wow
an asian fiesta explosion in -PRON- mouth
crispy thai shrimp chicken spring rolls serve with a bowl of fresh lettuce shred carrot mint sprig
wrap one of the 6 crispy fry spring_roll in a lettuce leaf with carrot mint then dip -PRON- in the sauce
so refreshingly tasty
a definite get this
double cheese mini burgers there be no kid menu here so -PRON- little one get this
-PRON- call those mini
each one of the 4 slider be enough for 1 little one so share if -PRON- want to
-PRON- each come with lettuce a slice of tomato pickle
crispy ahi sushi
roll these be okay not so special but do hit the spot
each of the 6 spicy_tuna_roll be crisp tempura fry serve with asian green a spicy hot soy chili dipping_sauce
sunday_night pasta serve everyday
tender beef short_rib steak piece slow cook with mushroom garlic parmesan cheese then serve on spaghetti pasta
try to imagine large juicy piece_of beef toss in pasta
this be a very generously portion hearty meaty dish
the sauce be less tomato marinara and more rich meaty meat sauce
do -PRON- mention -PRON- be meaty
baked to order dessert menu if -PRON- like freshly bake warm cookie order the chocolate_chip pecan
-PRON- will bake these on order so order -PRON- with -PRON- entree
-PRON- come box to go so -PRON- can bring up to the room
other bake on order good chocolate_cake beignet apple pie to name a_few
-PRON- love munch on warm cookie in the room
the chocolate_chip kind
service be great
-PRON- server ronnie be friendly helpful very_attentive to -PRON- table
even with a little late cookie order an_extra order to go -PRON- do an_excellent job accommodate -PRON- request
an overwhelming selection variety_of item on the menu in an extravagant not so cafe like setting
-PRON- think -PRON- will skip the sister restaurant next_time because after come_here that other place just seem a little cheesy now
one of -PRON- favorite place to pick_up some healthy food quickly
-PRON- tempe location basically fuel -PRON- senior year of college but so worth -PRON-
go_back to this_location with a couple friend recently and have a wonderful time
one of -PRON- friend have sever food allergy and -PRON- be very receptive to -PRON- question and make_sure -PRON- food be safe to eat
-PRON- be a little expensive hence the four_star but -PRON- understand -PRON- be pay for quality
-PRON- will_definitely be return soon
amazing service really nice place
go in and ask for a haircut and hair color and come_out with exactly_what -PRON- want
super_friendly 10\/10 would go again
the principal be quick witt but the show be plotless
there be also no advantage whatsoever in the vip or rip pricy option
-PRON- would rate this show while occasionally funny overall a poor value
friendly_staff easy appointment on -PRON- website
much nice than use the untended sauna at 24 fitness
with the towel rock salt lamp and choice of music -PRON- a mini vacation in under an_hour
-PRON- suggest -PRON- forgo the yelp coupon if -PRON- -PRON- first_time and get the $ 49 7 session over 7 day even if -PRON- only go 4 time -PRON- an_excellent way to try out the dry sauna experience
-PRON- family be at stancato 's on open day in 1971
sadly the food go from good to disappointing over the year and a lot_of people in the area quit go
but -PRON- have a gift certificate from -PRON- via the welcome wagon when -PRON- move back to cleveland last_year and -PRON- be amazed at the amazing dinner -PRON- have
wow
-PRON- get the roast pork marsala as a takeout order and split -PRON- with -PRON- mother
-PRON- be so tender and the sauce be bright and tasty
the seasonal salad be a mix of summertime flavor so fresh too
the green_bean be cook just right still firm and green
-PRON- be not do the meal justice in -PRON- description
each dish be fresh and flavorful
suffice -PRON- to say that -PRON- family start go to stancatos again after year of skip -PRON-
-PRON- encourage other to give -PRON- a try again if -PRON- have not lately
for those folk head to scottsdale for the sf gians spring training this be -PRON- hotel
-PRON- friend and -PRON- have be stay_at this hotel for the past four year
the location can_not be beat
-PRON- be only one block from the stadium and within walking_distance of old_town scottsdale
locate within walking_distance be ton_of restaurant and bar mean -PRON- can eat and drink to -PRON- heart 's content without have to worry_about one of those dastardly dui
this hotel offer as_far as -PRON- know only suite but that be certainly not a complaint on -PRON- part
each room come with a full shower\/tub toilet and a separate sink\/vanity area
there be a sit room when -PRON- first walk_in with a desk the hotel offer free_wifi and a broadband through an ethernet cable
also there be a tv in an armoire with drawer a closet a small refrigerator microwave coffee maker extra sink counter space coffee table and a loveseat\/sofabed
the bedroom have two queen sized bed a nightstand a dresser another tv and a small closet area
there be a set of door separate the bedroom from the sit area but -PRON- do_not do much for noise
one of the guy in -PRON- room be suck in the wall with -PRON- snore so -PRON- other roommate shut the door
that do nothing to keep -PRON- from wake_up as a result of the racket come from the other room
from -PRON- experience the room layout be alike
a recommendation of mine although not always available be to request a poolside room
-PRON- smoke but -PRON- do_not like smoke room
-PRON- always request a room with a patio
so -PRON- can go outside to handle -PRON- business
-PRON- be also fun to hang_out on the deck in beautiful weather
this hotel offer daily complimentary breakfast
-PRON- have never make -PRON- down there that early but -PRON- understand -PRON- have cereal bread etc
typical breakfast fare for a place offer free breakfast
at night however -PRON- have a free happy_hour with two type_of beer bud light
and -PRON- think miller lite red wine white_wine chex mix and chip and salsa
-PRON- have free flow booze for something like two hour
nice
-PRON- be great to sit in the hot_tub during_happy_hour with -PRON- cocktail and just hang_out
the holiday inn express also have a workout room although the room be somewhat on the small side
-PRON- have two treadmill one elliptical and a weight center like a bowflex
the hotel offer complimentary shuttle service between the hotel and the airport as_well_as local drop_off until 10_p.m. if available
the staff be generally nice also
do -PRON- sound_like -PRON- be sell -PRON- this hotel or what
now for the down side
check in be late
-PRON- pretty_much never have availability prior to -PRON- post time of 4 p.m.
checkout be at 12 p.m. though so that be a big plus
the other bad thing price keep skyrocket for this joint
-PRON- do_not honor loyalty and cut -PRON- a break for stay there year after year
-PRON- will probably continue to stay there if the rate remain below $ 200.00 but the rate be quickly inch up
hope this be enough information to answer all question relate to this hotel
if not visit http:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/ and search for the scottsdale az location
good_luck and happy travel
try this_place out after hear_about -PRON- on fb and from friend
-PRON- be burger be meh
-PRON- be pretty bland
and -PRON- find -PRON- have to add condiment and whatnot to make -PRON- taste yummy
-PRON- do like -PRON- chili cheese fry a lot
so -PRON- will back for those
not the great
but -PRON- be not very pricey
so that be a plus
literally the good thai food -PRON- have ever have

in_addition to several of the seafood item be cut there be only one pasta on the menu instead_of two which give -PRON- vegetarian friend almost no option
the caesar_salad be not worth order and the side of mash_potato be so so not very_flavorful
i really like the kobe burger but that be about the only good thing_about the place
-PRON- food come_out in about 8_minute and -PRON- feel_rush through the whole meal

-PRON- buddy tell -PRON- this be the place to go for vietnamese food and -PRON- be eager to give -PRON- a try and compare -PRON- to the pho at -PRON- super asian hometown
-PRON- have only have -PRON- pho and when -PRON- drink the first sip of the broth -PRON- be very_impressed
sadly the noodle do little for -PRON- taste_bud
the noodle consistency be hard and do_not absorb much flavor
like -PRON- be quite old and refrigerated\/frozen
-PRON- do_not blame -PRON- because -PRON- be sure -PRON- be near impossible to get fresh rice_noodle in pittsburgh
2010 fox8.com hotlist winner in best hair color cc salon always welcome -PRON- patron as friend vs. just another customer
shelly linda kim marry michelle natalie paul be all a delight to see each_time -PRON- visit
the staff make an_extra effort to get to know each client
-PRON- offer all of the service that fall under hair_salon and spa
although -PRON- personally only use the hair_cut the rest_of -PRON- family have use numerous other service
cc be a full service hair_salon spa
cc have never_fail to outshine in everything -PRON- have do for -PRON- and -PRON- family
the price here be reasonably proportion to the excellent quality -PRON- offer
if -PRON- in for just a hair_cut ask for linda -PRON- be -PRON- favorite although the rest_of the staff be very well qualified
may be one of the dingy pizza huts -PRON- have ever be to
table be dirty place be out of date
restaurant be freeze
though -PRON- list beer on the menu -PRON- do_not sell any
waiter say -PRON- can byob
seem -PRON- function mostly as a pick_up or carry out
bin zum x ten mal -PRON- be royal es ist wie immer sehr gediegen
optisch
-PRON- be
klassischen sinne gemeint wegen des service absolut positiv
ich denke die zimmer werden nach und nach renoviert da kann kaum be schiefgehen
und wenn man da bei der buchung berücksichtigt ebenso wie die lage nach hinten raus und ggf
und soweit verfügbar ein größere zimmer nimmt ist alle besten
extra stern für sauberkeit lage und originalität des gesetzten publikums
so war das wohl früher mal standard bei den ersten adressen
-PRON- will keep be short and simple
food be fantastic
fresh flavorful and keep want to try more and more thing off the menu
-PRON- have a mix of tapas item and be still hungry so order the paella which fill -PRON-
drink be excellent
service be attentive and prompt
only_complaint be that -PRON- feel item be overprice for the amount_of food provide
what a great show
great price
and -PRON- come with an open bar
the hypnotist be wonderful
-PRON- be an_adult show but no one be make fun of
-PRON- friend and -PRON- laugh so hard through the whole thing
-PRON- be a lot_of fun
-PRON- wish -PRON- have volunteer
arrive here with -PRON- wife
-PRON- do_not have a reservation but wait about_10_minute for the first available table which be inside
-PRON- be base -PRON- score off -PRON- experience in the follow category
atmosphere
for a brewery the atmosephere be very_nice and closely resemble a sport_bar with numerous tvs present
-PRON- also sell merchandise in various form which i think be pretty_cool
service
once seat out waitress assist -PRON- promptly bring two water with -PRON- prior to -PRON- order -PRON-
-PRON- also check back in on be through out -PRON- meal
food
-PRON- order the kilt lifter brat sandwhich which i find the be delectable
carmelized onion bacon bit cheese and of_course 3 brat split on marble rye bread
definately worth the $_11
-PRON- wife order the buffalo wings which be about_10 or 11 total for $_10
-PRON- be okay to -PRON-
but -PRON- think -PRON- be average as_well
the big thing -PRON- want be more buffalo sauce
-PRON- be not sauce well and kind_of dry
also the ranch be not good actually flavorless this be a first
beer
most_important
wow -PRON- be honestly disappointed in this department
-PRON- order the hop knot and the raj
both be suppose to be ipa with the raj be the strong out of the two
-PRON- be a huge ipa fan and love heavy hop and bitterness with mine in_addition to flavor other aromatic note
neither of these beer have those element present
the raj taste more like a pale ale than a ipa
-PRON- will say -PRON- be very smooth but lack flavor
the hop knot have a mild hoppy taste but no other note
typically if a brewery have good beer i will stay and drink many more especially
$_5 a pint
but after these fail attempt at beer -PRON- get the check and leave
-PRON- do_not want to try another beer here
as always these be just -PRON- $ 0.02
the main_reason that i give 3_star be that this be a brewery and -PRON- come for the beer and the beer be average at good
if this be a restaurant or bar and the expectation level be different -PRON- would have be a 4_star
this be an_amazing dining_experience -PRON- certainly pay for -PRON- but -PRON- have no regret
-PRON- order the 130\/person tasting_menu
-PRON- be not really a tasting_menu since -PRON- give -PRON- full sized_portion for each dish
after have bread and the first three dish of the first course -PRON- be pretty satisfied
the diver scallop from this course be the good -PRON- have ever have truly amazing
the next course be delicious murder on -PRON- stomach
there be just so_much food
-PRON- have 2 steak the strip be fantastic potato puree assorted and grill shroom and corn
everything be well execute and simple showcas the exceptional quality of the ingredient
thankfully the dessert stomach kick in because -PRON- be give 4 full sized dessert
a truly divine bread_pudding 4 scoop of delicious gellato a wonderful cheesecake with cumquat and a bowl of blackberry
the bread_pudding be a serious stand out
-PRON- wife who hat bread_pudding would not stop eat -PRON-
-PRON- have to clamor to get -PRON- share
there go -PRON- playstation 3 money but like -PRON- say no regret
omg this_place be delicious
tacos al pastor all the way
-PRON- salsa_bar
do_not get -PRON- start -PRON- love -PRON- salsa_bar
-PRON- hate -PRON- when other taco place hog -PRON- salsa in the back and make -PRON- ask for extra and then give -PRON- the tiny plastic container
not here
open salsa_bar for everyone
lol -PRON- quesadilla be awesome -PRON- wish -PRON- live across the street -PRON- would come_here way more
eco auto spa be banch of bulture -PRON- will attempt to charge -PRON- more money for the service -PRON- already provide
the $_40 diamond wash include shapm the carpet and interior treatment
-PRON- tell -PRON- about few trouble that need to be vaccum -PRON- try to charge -PRON- $ 110 to vaccum when i come_back tobpick up -PRON- car
-PRON- look_like nothing have be do
watch out those schiester
probably go to this_location or the one at arrowhead once a month
very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit
-PRON- usually have coupon online
and -PRON- take -PRON- from -PRON- smartphone
the only_gripe -PRON- have be that -PRON- banana at breakfast be usually still a little too green to be tasty
although the donut muffin make up for -PRON-
recommend for all meal but lunch and dinner be usually a little good
screw flanders
go here a_few time good food and everything only_thing about -PRON- be the wierd parking_lot -PRON- dosnt have street access -PRON- have to go down the industrial park to get into -PRON- but other_than_that food quality wendy_'s and the people be friendly
wow
-PRON- do_not get all the hater
-PRON- just do the travelocity deal on 7\/30 and have a fantastic time
the greet out front be very_friendly and the waiter be excellent
-PRON- always find that if -PRON- treat these_people like people and not talk meat puppet who be put on this earth to serve -PRON- then -PRON- be virtually assure of a good experience
-PRON- friend and -PRON- start with the crabcake appy which be excellent
and then -PRON- both have seafood louie salad shrimp and crab
-PRON- be really good
next come the kc strip steak which be amazing
-PRON- have wild mushroom and herb fry as -PRON- side
the free champagne be quite good but what_happen with the wine be what put the last 1\/2_star on this review -PRON- order a $ 42 bottle_of malbac which be out of stock
-PRON- offer -PRON- this superb wine which be normally $_100 and on sale for $ 62
-PRON- knock another $_10 off the price so -PRON- have an_excellent wine for just a_few dollar more_than retail price in a liquor store
the churro dessert with whip_cream and vanilla dipping_sauce be yummy
-PRON- roll out of there completely full and totally satisfied
the place be happily very busy and fairly loud but not obnoxiously so
the restaurant have a casual feel despite the menu price
this be definitely only a special_occasion place or a place to use a coupon or great online deal
-PRON- be just kick -PRON-
-PRON- do_not get a 2nd coupon to use
buyer beware
knowing that most of the furniture here be just particleboard and cheaply finish the price will seem about right
the rub be that when -PRON- deliver make_sure -PRON- closely look each piece over
half of the stuff -PRON- order be damage and to get a replacement -PRON- must first send out a tech from another company to see if -PRON- can repair
if not then -PRON- will decide to replace maybe
-PRON- expect -PRON- to buy the extra warranty at the store to cover damage from ship from overseas and delivery to -PRON-
-PRON- may think the warranty if for the stuff after -PRON- get -PRON- but -PRON- really see -PRON- as a way -PRON- get a little more money from -PRON- to ensure when -PRON- be deliver -PRON- be not bust up
in -PRON- opinion -PRON- will_never take delivery again
if -PRON- buy go there and inspect the piece and then take -PRON- home
also -PRON- will save the $ 150 in delivery fee
actually -PRON- will not be back
junk furniture

and -PRON- like -PRON- that way
all pretence be throw out the window all -PRON- get be a solid meal at good deal
-PRON- have a pizza oven so the pizza crust be do well here
the tortellini be a little tough and over cook
the other pasta even_though not al_dente work -PRON- will with the sauce
-PRON- be surprised at how fast -PRON- eat -PRON- all up -PRON- be tasty
-PRON- usually would not review a chain like jj unless there be something specific to the location

very_disappointed
just order lunch from work thru ubereats
-PRON- get the order and all of -PRON- salsa be miss

at first -PRON- argue_with -PRON- as to if -PRON- be really miss -PRON-

then the first employee tell a second employee to talk to -PRON-
-PRON- be polite and do_not raise -PRON- voice
the second employee once_again ask if -PRON- be in one of -PRON- bag
-PRON- check again no salsa

-PRON- will take that since -PRON- be at work and only have so_much time for lunch
but -PRON- know -PRON- be right down the street
both folk seem_like -PRON- be a pain and that -PRON- be lie
be in customer_service -PRON-
-PRON- be a_bit disappointed

-PRON- can_not tell -PRON- the last_time that someone in a restaurant shake -PRON- hand as -PRON- enter
-PRON- may not have happen at all before tonight
the food be serve up on plate after plate after plate
the only_downside here be that those small_plate to eat the appetizer suddenly go missing but -PRON- can scarcely fault table 274 there be just too_much demand
and there be little_slow down this crowd the kabob stick work well in a pinch
mmm
the cheese and sausage plate the pork_belly wrap in bacon the short_rib and sweet_potato gnocchi the shrimp cake and yes the chocolate pana cotta

-PRON- say -PRON- do_not ask for a box because -PRON- do_not -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- in a box without ask
so that be a little intrusive and rude to assume and judge
the pizza do taste delicious though
just make_sure -PRON- do_not get a box unless -PRON- want the manager try to guilt -PRON- about -PRON-
-PRON- have buy two kia 's from rodeo kia over the last few_month

-PRON- call to speak to the manager and -PRON- never once return -PRON- call
-PRON- take -PRON- money then do_not give a shit about ur phone beware
-PRON- also send -PRON- mom home with -PRON- phone and keep -PRON- sim card so -PRON- could_not even have a work phone until -PRON- open the follow day
bad business
treasure island- excuse
me-
ti have a great location right_next to fashion show mall and easily walkable from the rest_of the strip
the sirens show be perfect for wake -PRON- up from an afternoon nap the starbucks line be always long but -PRON- have mystere the first cirque_show to have a custom theater build for -PRON-
-PRON- be -PRON- next show -PRON- would want to see when in_vegas
look amazing
-PRON- be great because -PRON- be on the corner of las_vegas blvd and spring mountain road so -PRON- can make a quick getaway to the freeway without have to sit in stupid strip traffic
and the bed
sooooooo comfortable
this may sound weird but -PRON- have the good smell hotel hand soap
and when -PRON- enter the lobby -PRON- always smell like a fresh spritz of something
-PRON- be really specific be not -PRON-
either_way -PRON- just smell good
that be all -PRON- need to know
-PRON- need a trailer to haul the wife 's car across the country as_well_as the rest_of -PRON- stuff
-PRON- be on a timeline and need -PRON- within 6 week
and so -PRON- think -PRON- be stick with what be on the lot
luckily -PRON- find these_guy
katy be super_helpful and get -PRON- a custom trailer build and deliver in a month as_well_as do -PRON- for about 4k less_than the lot in mesa
-PRON- location be not pretty but run with low overhead allow -PRON- to sell cheap
mitchell -PRON- think help check -PRON- out in -PRON- before -PRON- pull away and be a great guy
all in all -PRON- be definitely_worth check if -PRON- need a trailer
old_school shop with one of a kind knowledge of part
carol be a true treasure and bob would be lose without -PRON- knowledge of the location of part -PRON- knowledge of the part and bike -PRON- plus -PRON- loyalty
love talk to -PRON- and listen to -PRON- extensive knowledge of old and new harley 's
new year mean new menu_item
all -PRON- can say be thank jackie
try the new turkey salad crostini yesterday and fellow foodie -PRON- should try -PRON- too
or the tofu scramble with potato
or just a side of the roasted veggie
-PRON- pretty_much can_not go_wrong here
wy knot
-PRON- go in there today for a money order
tell -PRON- why the clerk tell -PRON- there be a $_5 charge for the freak money order
five dollar
whet
like who do that
especially when other place such_as supermarket or even the post_office charge under a dollar
-PRON- have even check the website before hand just to see how_much the charge be for a money order and the site do_not give one
that be probably because -PRON- know $_5 be too dang high
unfortunately -PRON- be in a rush
so -PRON- have to pay the 5 buck but dang
lesson learn
do -PRON- know_what -PRON- could have do w\/ $_5
well let -PRON- tell -PRON- costco 's gas be currently $ 2.50\/gallon
-PRON- could have get two more gallon of gas
a $_5 foot long from subway before the tax
an_old navy t_shirt for the low
a pack of hamburger meat
underwear b\/c -PRON- can_not have enough underwear
basically -PRON- can buy a lot_of thing w\/ $_5 instead_of spend -PRON- on a dang money order
-PRON- have a checking and saving account there but charge that hot mess price smh
also have to wait a good 5 7 minute inside before get help
tao be certainly the it place to be when -PRON- debut a few_year_ago and as_far as vegas club go -PRON- be one of the good one
impressively -PRON- even manage to steal pure 's thunder
and while -PRON- be a favorite among asians despite the hype and the initial wow\/glamour factor -PRON- will soon realize that tao may be bit overhyped
-PRON- certainly have have -PRON- bad_experience here see below and have yet to really truly enjoy club here
honestly the club be very_nice inside visually with a strong urban zen feel
the hot babe in the bathtub at the entrance and inside be certainly a crowd pleaser and welcome distinction
but -PRON- be dark as fuq inside to the point -PRON- can_not really see anyone which can be a good or bad thing depend_on -PRON- situation
if -PRON- be try to meet_up with friend already inside
or -PRON- be lose good_luck find -PRON-
the dance_floor be nicely sized but like any vegas club -PRON- be pack to the brim and -PRON- can_not really move around on the dance_floor
plus the annoying stupid idiot who try to shove -PRON- way_through the dance_floor really ruin the fun regardless of how many expensive drink -PRON- have
-PRON- guess this be just how -PRON- be in_vegas
on the other_hand the tao beach club at the top be really_cool and give -PRON- a gorgeous view of the strip and the venetian
-PRON- feel_like cabana club in la
but really beyond the glitz and glamor this_place try to hype with -PRON- sensual and exotic asian theme -PRON- have have more fun go to pure
but if -PRON- have never be -PRON- be worth a check_out if -PRON- want to wait 2_3 hour or grab bottle service\/table
bad_experience 1
the first_time -PRON- go -PRON- be deny entry by the bouncer due_to -PRON- shoe and be force to go_back across the street to change despite inquire the club in_advance about the dress code
jeans and white casual shoe be fine as long as -PRON- be clean -PRON- ass
yes
-PRON- know -PRON- be in_vegas and yes
-PRON- should know better to dress -PRON- good but personally -PRON- hate wear nice expensive dress to club since a.
-PRON- be probably go to get scuff inside b.
-PRON- be uncomfortable to move around in c.
who the hell would want to dance in dress shoe
-PRON- certainly do_not see people play sport
yes dancing be consider a sport in loafer
really -PRON- should be allow to wear shoe -PRON- be comfortable dance in
-PRON- be not like -PRON- be wear basketball shoe -PRON- be wear -PRON- casual wheat\/gray sketchers
but the lady at the club tell -PRON- -PRON- be fine earlier -PRON- complain
-PRON- do_not_care say the bouncer
anyway after 30_minute -PRON- make -PRON- into tao only to discover a bunch_of white guy inside wear plain t_shirt and white basketball shoe
wtf
discrimination
oh
and then -PRON- have to spend a good 40_minute search in the dark for -PRON- friend
fun time
2nd bad_experience
on -PRON- most_recent_trip this past summer the dj be absolutely_horrible
possibly one of the bad dj -PRON- have ever hear which really kill the club mood
-PRON- gf be also piss off over the bad dj and also with the amount_of push and shoving that go on inside
after 2_hour in the club -PRON- group just leave
yes -PRON- be that bad
at_least this time -PRON- get in fast as -PRON- stay_at the venetian and get the vip treatment
patty krenos have be -PRON- financial advisor for over_10_year
-PRON- would not trust anyone_else with -PRON- family 's finance
-PRON- be knowledgeable honest and always willing_to answer all of -PRON- question
both -PRON- and -PRON- staff be extremely pleasant
-PRON- always look_forward_to meet with patty to discuss -PRON- financial goal
-PRON- and -PRON- wife stay_here for 4 night during christmas
the hotel be not the good and also not the bad place to stay for the price
room be decent but have very_limited amenity
room do_not have microwave and coffee machine
the reason -PRON- be give this hotel 1\/5 star be because of the rude lie and cheat behavior of the hotel staff
-PRON- would never recommend anyone to stay because of how the staff behave with -PRON- and will_never ever stay_at any westgate hotel
after be let down by an over price and under flavor burger at gordon ramsay 's
-PRON- feel the need to try again and decide to give bobby flays burger palace a try
locate right on the strip at the mandarin oriental hotel bobby 's be the perfect place to people_watch
the menu be small and the burger be somewhat basic
all of the burger have the free option of be crunchifi by top -PRON- with crunchy plain bag potato chip
on the side -PRON- can order ala cart fries and onion rings
the overall price be about 25 less then the majority_of other celebrity burger on the strip
the good part
the burger be actually very good
-PRON- order the basic classic all american cheese burger with double cheese bacon and all top with the potato chip on a sesame_seed bun
when -PRON- burger be bring to the table the bacon be miss
so -PRON- let the server know
not only do -PRON- immediately bring -PRON- the bacon for the burger but also extra bacon on the side to make up for the mistake score
-PRON- burger be cook just right
medium well moist but not pink with a nice crust and flavor that remind -PRON- of burger
-PRON- mom would cook -PRON- in the cast iron pan grow_up
on -PRON- -PRON- have a choice of ketchup 's and mustard 's
the classic hines or some that be house make
-PRON- favorite be the jalapeno mustard which be slightly sweet with a little heat
-PRON- have some very good crispy fresh fry on the side that be perfect for dip in the mustard
the onion_ring be not as good as -PRON- be a little less crunchy and a little more greasy
next_time -PRON- would do fry only
simone have a carolina burger that be top with honey bbq_sauce and green_onion mustard slaw
-PRON- also have a perfectly_cook burger which -PRON- really_enjoy
-PRON- think the slaw be a little overpower with the flavor of the onion but -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- also have chip on -PRON- and borrow some of -PRON- extra bacon to put on -PRON-
so overall this be one of the good place for a burger on the strip and -PRON- much easy on the wallet then most
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend bobby 's burger palace
-PRON- come_here with some friend for winterlicious and have a great time
the meat be a_bit on the salty side but with some salad -PRON- do_not feel too_bad
the entertainment be ok some dancer and live band play but -PRON- do get old pretty_quickly
-PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- be because -PRON- be there on a friday_night but the restaurant be extremely noisy and
-PRON- friend and -PRON- have to yell_at each_other to be hear so this be not the place if -PRON- be look to have a quiet meal
-PRON- would_recommend try out this_place once just for the experience
for the menu -PRON- highly_recommend the top sirloin and the grill pineapple
tips for driver -PRON- do get free_parking after 7pm
the parking_lot be behind the building off of redpath ave
make_sure -PRON- drive all the way in
all -PRON- have to do be park and leave -PRON- car information with the waitress at the front
the drive down water street from ocean to victory offer a nostalgic view of henderson
the vintage barber_shop could_not be more perfectly locate and accessible whether walk or parking
the quaint barber pole evoke a sense of the old time quality of service
in essence -PRON- be a refreshing sight and a standout
last saturday -PRON- take -PRON- teen family_member to the barber_shop for a haircut
-PRON- step in without an_appointment and inquire about the wait
-PRON- seem encouraging as there be only a_few people wait
and -PRON- be mid afternoon
of_course -PRON- take longer than anticipate
within 45_minute -PRON- be in the barber 's chair
-PRON- do_not seem too sure about -PRON- at first
while wait -PRON- see other boy and man happy with -PRON- result
this put -PRON- more at_ease while anticipate -PRON- new haircut
fortunately -PRON- observe a small sign on the wall in back of the shop
cash_only
on tuesdays and saturdays haircut be $_20 otherwise $_30
then there be the sign do_not forget to tip -PRON- barber
whoa another trip out and back to obtain $_25 cash
conveniently -PRON- be able_to visit an atm at one of the casino on water street
-PRON- sit and watch -PRON- experience
finally the barber apply a hot towel treatment with shave cream to clean up the hairline
-PRON- be think that -PRON- will soon need to come_back for -PRON- sixteenth birthday and first real shave
that would be worth the extra $_25 price for such a special_occasion
without an_appointment approximately 90 minute_later for $_25 -PRON- be take a pic of a very happy young_man sport a new haircut
this restaurant have really good food
the chip and salsa be fresh the guacamole be make after -PRON- order -PRON- and -PRON- get the chicken tostada salad which be bomb
-PRON- also have white_wine sangria which be fresh and light
the price be on the high side for mexican food- probably because -PRON- be right on the strip
if -PRON- sit_outside -PRON- can see the fountain show
go during_happy_hour to save some money
absolutely_amazing dinner and experience
not one item disappointed and while the food change week to week
so there be no point to mention specific dish
rest assure -PRON- will not be disappoint
the presentation flavor and service be a 10 out of 10
-PRON- be look to see something new in_vegas
-PRON- find -PRON- at the cosmo but not in a good way
the lobby be full of drunken trash worthy of an off strip good western without a single member of staff in sight
just pass_through -PRON- be keenly aware of the danger of be puke on sucker punch or pick pocketed
luckily -PRON- make -PRON- through without a major incident but -PRON- will not return to see if -PRON- luck hold out
if -PRON- have always want to go to the jersey shore but do_not want to go all the way to jersey
look no further
if -PRON- want to hit rock bottom this be the place
if -PRON- be a career criminal or have other reason to frequent a location that be understaffed and do_not bother with security -PRON- want the cosmopolitan
if -PRON- be look to enjoy a fun evening with the fine people in_vegas this be not the place
finally somewhere that serve homemade sausage_gravy
today be -PRON- first_time stop after numerous_time drive_past and see_how pack the parking_lot always be
-PRON- be so_glad -PRON- do
the bf get the breakfast sandwich -PRON- have sausage_gravy over biscuit and -PRON- split an order of home fry and a pancake
as_soon_as -PRON- walk_in the door the entire staff greet -PRON- from wherever -PRON- be stand
food and service be outstanding
on a thursday lunch this restaurant be busy
however -PRON- only have to wait about 5 10_minute
-PRON- be well_worth the wait
the drink and food be awesome and of great value
-PRON- have the sesame crust salmon
-PRON- be the house specialty and -PRON- do_not_disappoint
-PRON- like the fry spinach that come with -PRON- so_much that -PRON- wish -PRON- get more of those instead_of the mash_potato
those be good as_well but -PRON- really like the fry spinach
the server be excellent and very_friendly
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be very happy to have stop_by this restaurant
nice bar_area also
-PRON- have be to many breakfast restaurant and this be the good by_far
-PRON- be go to turn_around because the lineup at the door be pretty big but man be -PRON- glad -PRON- do_not
-PRON- get a place pretty fast and even if the place be pack the service be amazing
from the hostess to the waiter everyone be on point
the lady at the door even remember -PRON- boyfriend 's name and say bye by -PRON- name when -PRON- leave
the menu be huge and get at_least 200 choice
but -PRON- be crave waffle
so -PRON- do_not spend too_much time and the rest_of the menu
-PRON- take the house special waffle and -PRON- be out of this_world
very big and tasty waffle load of apple creme anglaise and caramel
-PRON- will be go_back to try a_few more item on the menu
great food amazing staff and awesome atmosphere
but if -PRON- be go there to have a quiet breakfast think again because -PRON- be busy and pretty noisy
-PRON- have not be here for several year and decide to visit vogue bistro once_again with -PRON- wife
on -PRON- previous visit -PRON- recall be disappointed and seem not much have change
-PRON- know vogue have position -PRON- to be an upscale restaurant but -PRON- fall short in so_many way
-PRON- have eat at numerous of vogue 's competitor in central phoenix as_well_as other location throughout the valley and have thoroughly_enjoy -PRON- all as one can verify with -PRON- previous yelp_review however -PRON- can_not say the same with vogue
lot_of little thing
but the issue be -PRON- meal one of the blandest steak -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- life
-PRON- wonder_if -PRON- have de savoriz -PRON- food due_to -PRON- clientele be mostly senior
-PRON- do_not_know but there be plenty_of other eatery where one actually enjoy eat -PRON- meal
-PRON- be not_sure which doctor -PRON- have but a couple week_ago -PRON- old dog suffer a bad attack
-PRON- be already 15_year old so when -PRON- talk to the vet -PRON- decide to let -PRON- go
the vet be very kind and when -PRON- come_back to do the deed -PRON- cry with -PRON-
this mean a lot to -PRON- family and even_though -PRON- could_not save -PRON- baby -PRON- be very kind and considerate throughout the process
lax could learn a lot from the phoenix airport
clean easy to navigate access to walking treadmill everywhere and ton_of place to eat at the gate unlike the two crappy option -PRON- have in lax
everything just seem good here
what a disaster of a dinner
-PRON- show_up and order -PRON- app and dinner at the same time
over_an_hour and 20_minute_later -PRON- main_course have not arrive
when walk back to ask the waiter if -PRON- put in -PRON- order the manager want to argue and tell -PRON- that seafood take long to cook than other dish
note to manager do_not argue_with the customer

what -PRON- have last_night do_not look_like anything on the first 18 result
-PRON- know sound ridiculous
but_hey -PRON- just want to double_check because what -PRON- eat last_night be ridiculously greasy to the point that the bread be soak
the bread be barely toast the shape of the bread be entirely different to the shape of the burger and -PRON- bring back memory of eat short hot_dog with long hot_dog bun back in the day when -PRON- be in college
-PRON- appreciate the pleasant memory from college but now that -PRON- be 31
-PRON- would like to have food that be a_bit better in quality
the fry be unremarkable
so food aside -PRON- be pay the bill and the server do the one thing -PRON- absolutely abhor when -PRON- go out to eat
for a $ 15.xx bill -PRON- give -PRON- a $_20 and -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- need change
now ok
-PRON- be not go to be live in the street over $ 4.xx
but at the same time -PRON- find -PRON- very annoying when someone ask for a 30 tip when the service be poor
do_not go unless every place and -PRON- really mean every place in the area
that sell anything edible be closed or
-PRON- love curt service and bad food
to be fair the place be not all bad news bear -PRON- get to meet_up with -PRON- friend
so_glad to have find this_place
-PRON- be always look for a good as_well_as reasonable place for a hair_cut and this be the first one where -PRON- be happy with -PRON- hair_cut even a week after

-PRON- do_not_know
one night -PRON- go here and out of the three toilet cubicl one be miss a door one do_not have a lock and the other be well
-PRON- do_not really want -PRON- to go into detail
-PRON- be once tell the standard of toilet tell -PRON- a lot about the quality of a place
that visit put -PRON- right off for good
the tron be very_popular with student though so -PRON- do okay and be quite busy on a friday\/saturday night
-PRON- like the old ghengis grill and the current change that -PRON- have make make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- teacher be look over -PRON- back which make -PRON- feel uncomfortable

dined at flemmings for an important business dinner and the waiter knock over a full glass of red wine square into -PRON- lap
-PRON- shirt pant and purse be soak
the staff be quick to react and even offer to cover the cleaning bill
however -PRON- do_not comp the wine or discount the meal in any way
the operating partner jackie e. give -PRON- -PRON- card to contact -PRON- for the cleaning but when -PRON- reach out to let -PRON- know that -PRON- be luckily able_to get the wine out with no staining -PRON- do_not even_bother to respond
nothing
-PRON- at_least expect a oh good glad to hear -PRON- kind_of thing
hell even an offer to return for a free appetizer or dessert
but nothing
-PRON- really like fleming 's too but after this experience -PRON- will not be back
mark be -PRON- all time favourite carpet cleaner
-PRON- be honestly the good
-PRON- carpet would have be long go if not for mark at all star chemdry
-PRON- do an_excellent job every_time and make -PRON- carpet look brand_new
-PRON- have remove stain that -PRON- think would never come_out
-PRON- have be use -PRON- for about_15 year and -PRON- hope -PRON- never retire
the staff here be so sweet greet -PRON- with smile and -PRON- be so helpful
glad to be start -PRON- journey with -PRON-
this be now the second_time -PRON- have be here and both time -PRON- have great meal
after have be to many_other high_end restaurant -PRON- think this_place offer incredibly good value as compare to some of the rest
sadly -PRON- do_not remember what -PRON- have the first_time about a year_ago but -PRON- do remember have a very good meal
last_night 's experience with the 4-course signature menu be very good
-PRON- do_not choose the 7-course signature menu because the whole table would have have to have -PRON-
the lineup be as follow
fois gra brûlée very interesting concept and tasty
basically creme_brûlée make with fois gra
worth try once for the extra $_10 but probably not worthwhile every_time as the waygu beef tartar be also very good scallop
prepare well with ox tail pork loin
this be where the money be
after -PRON- take the first_bite -PRON- have to ask the waiter what -PRON- be eat because -PRON- be so incredibly good
the loin -PRON- be good but -PRON- do a second part of -PRON- mince and season with mostly pork shoulder at_least accord to the waiter
-PRON- be unlike anything -PRON- have ever eat
-PRON- would have be awesome if the whole dish be make out of that
layered chocolate_cake with coffee ice_cream -PRON- remember use a different two word term start with a g ganache but can_not recall exactly but wow -PRON- be heavenly
-PRON- appear as a small bar but -PRON- be densely rich an incredibly decadent
the coffee ice_cream with cocoa shaving be also very good
overall a very good meal and excellent value for the price
the tea rose cocktail be also very good

the hotel be good although the room layout in 1821 -PRON- stay_at be really odd with a long empty hallway inside the room before -PRON- enter the actual room on the right
everyone be extremely_friendly and polite
the pool be over chlorinated and small
the restaurant on premise be a bit_overpriced
the big issue be dishonesty of -PRON- cleaning staff
-PRON- 9-year old leave almost new ll bean hiking shoe in the room upon check in
the cleaning lady_who do_not speak much english or french for that matter be clean the room next_door
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be check_out
once -PRON- return to stowe vt -PRON- realize -PRON- forget the shoe
knowing -PRON- stay_at le westin for only one night and the shoe be there in between the two bed -PRON- immediately call the hotel
-PRON- transfer -PRON- to lose and find who tell -PRON- that the housekeeping lady_who clean the room do_not return any shoe
still full of hope -PRON- think that maybe shoe get kick in under the bed and -PRON- miss -PRON-
lost and found tell -PRON- -PRON- will check and call -PRON-
-PRON- never do
-PRON- call again leave a message
nothing
-PRON- know the cleaning lady find the shoe but fail to submit -PRON- to lose and find and that be not the hotel -PRON- want to stay_at

but not bad consider -PRON- right_next to asu
if -PRON- could give no star -PRON- would order for delivery -PRON- food come in an_hour but still warm when -PRON- get here
-PRON- get 2 beef kebab hummus and baklava the rice be so dry and taste burn the beef have no flavor the hummus basically have a bottle_of oil on_top -PRON- have to pour out the oil just to get to the hummus

je suis allée à ikanos ce midi avec 2 collègue et nous_avon tous été emballés par la nourriture
la table d'hôte du midi est à 22 $ comprenant entrée plat et mignardis et je peux vous assurer que tout a l'air excellent et il
y a un choix vraiment intéressant
nous_avon pris la salade en entrée et comme plat calamar frit filet de porc et pieuvre grillée
je dois avouer que la pieuvre grillée est à tomber par terre un véritable régal cuisinée dan une petite sauce à l'huile
et aux câpre vraiment succulente
a essayer à tout prix

-PRON- do know -PRON- ice maker be not work
vladimir respond immediately locate the part need locally and return to get everything in work order
now -PRON- world have ice and a totally reliable appliance serviceman
this restaurant share an address with sapphire gentlemen 's club
as a married man away_from home on business -PRON- be not brave enough to go walk_around and see if -PRON- could find the restaurant or have to brave half naked waifs to get to -PRON-
after come home and read other_review -PRON- realize that -PRON- only share the address and parking_lot with the lady
-PRON- apparently have a separate entrance
-PRON- may try again now that -PRON- have more information but family should be warn that industrial rd be an_adult entertainment district so the kiddy may ask more question that -PRON- be ready to answer
to -PRON- surprise the owner 's of thai hut be the original owner from thai orchid who come_out of retirement to open this little place
great food great price and a quaint location make for a great meal
-PRON- believe -PRON- complaint to shutterfly will sum up -PRON- experience
-PRON- advise -PRON- order from mpix or elsewhere and mail -PRON- out yourself
shutterfly -PRON- be very_disappointed on how -PRON- order be handle
-PRON- spend a significant amount_of time prepare -PRON- graduation card and try to make -PRON- memorable
-PRON- be happy to see that -PRON- make the process easy by allow -PRON- to ship to multiple address but the result be far less_than desirable
-PRON- be outraged after one of -PRON- family_member tell -PRON- that -PRON- have almost throw away -PRON- package because -PRON- do_not have -PRON- name anywhere on the packaging
the package be attn to shutterfly and have shutterfly write all over the packaging
no one will ever willingly purchase from -PRON- know that when -PRON- send out -PRON- invitation -PRON- may as_well end_up in -PRON- recipient dumpster
secondly have -PRON- journey far enough to open the packaging -PRON- be load with so_much advertisement that the card be unnoticeable
-PRON- be glad that a family_member warn -PRON- about this and will do a facebook invite instead
furthermore -PRON- will write review about -PRON- experience and make_sure other do_not fall_into the same trap
this_company choose advertisement over happy customer
-PRON- encourage -PRON- to read what -PRON- customer be say and try_something_different
perhaps one day this review will be irrelevant but as of 5\/8\/2016 this be shutterfly
-PRON- have mixed feeling about the bourbon room
on one hand -PRON- be a good option if -PRON- want to grab drink in a casual environment without worry_about line or cover
however -PRON- do_not really serve as a replacement for the club and -PRON- be definitely lack the lounge atmosphere
despite not fitting into one specific category the bourbon room still manage to draw a crowd
-PRON- think -PRON- be a combination of the loud 80 music video strong drink and easy accessibility from the casino floor
the bourbon room definitely cater to a specific niche market and more specifically fan_of 80 music
as a result the crowd reflect this with many patron in the 30 and 40
-PRON- find crowd to be carefree and non judgmental
unlike the club people be not there to be see or to pick_up
-PRON- be just there to relax and have fun
another thing -PRON- like about the bourbon room be -PRON- energy
-PRON- have an emcee\/host who joke around introduce song and get guest involve in contest in exchange for free drink or show ticket
-PRON- can be extremely entertaining or also annoying depend_on -PRON- mood
overall -PRON- be not a bad place to grab a drink for a more low_key night
if -PRON- be stay_at the venetian or palazzo -PRON- doubt -PRON- will miss -PRON-
self_serve frozen_yogurt
what a fantastic idea
want a treat and want do -PRON- completely by -PRON-
this be the place to go
-PRON- can choose -PRON- flavor of yogurt or choose several of -PRON- if -PRON- want take the amount -PRON- want -PRON- pay by weight not selection then_proceed to choose the topping -PRON- wish to garnish -PRON- with there be about 40 50 of -PRON- pay for -PRON- then ravage that delicious treat
be careful though -PRON- can get a little expensive but what an innovative fun way to make -PRON- frozen_yogurt treat the way you want it
-PRON- go with half chocolate half coconut yogurt with brownie and coconut shaving
the chocolate side be amazing the coconut be too_sweet for -PRON- taste
all in all very good
will try again
-PRON- also serve crepe -PRON- be duly note for -PRON- next_visit
just what Mount lebanon need
a real homemade ice_cream shop
-PRON- do_not experience anything that be truly out of this_world but nevertheless -PRON- can appreciate the creamy homemade goodness
plenty_of place to sit and the price be not_too_bad
-PRON- think that the min credit_card charge be now $_5
-PRON- think that be pretty standard for a lot_of place heck right down the road at pamela 's -PRON- do_not even accept card
so -PRON- be that there be even this option
-PRON- can see that -PRON- will be come_here a lot in the future
oh so good
bless -PRON-
dean thomas for come to the state and make -PRON- awesome food

fast delivery unless the young girl waiter take -PRON- order
will always go there regardless
highly_recommend
the food be great here
-PRON- friend and -PRON- just have a dinner of oyster unfortunately -PRON- do_not come during the happy_hour
so -PRON- be pretty damn expensive especially with the bottle_of prosecco -PRON- order
but the oyster be lovely
if -PRON- have the chance try the wellfleet
the location be a little tuck_away about a 5_minute walk from osgoode station
the decor be nice and warm tiny bit of hipster pirate
there be only one bathroom for each gender so -PRON- will have to wait in line if -PRON- get busy
however -PRON- wish -PRON- could give the place a 3.5 rating instead_of 4
-PRON- go on a saturday at 5_p.m. so the place be not pack
the waiter while -PRON- get -PRON- order right be not very_attentive or particularly friendly and with one order -PRON- take over 30_minute to get -PRON- food and drink
but -PRON- will go_back for the oyster preferably at happy_hour
really_cool place
wish -PRON- have a_few more guest beer_selection but have a nice ipa while -PRON- be there
food be good price be very fair service be average
-PRON- bring both of -PRON- girl to see dr. shultz
from the minute -PRON- walk_in the door -PRON- feel extremely welcome
all of the staff be extremely_friendly and so great with -PRON- kid
-PRON- have never be to such a fantastically nice and great office
both of -PRON- need fairly extensive work do and dr. shultz be great tell -PRON- when -PRON- be do -PRON- would have beautiful princess tooth
-PRON- be extremely happy with -PRON- experience there and would gladly recommend -PRON- to anyone
-PRON- notice a lot_of people give this_place a bad review because of the service
-PRON- a very busy place and i can see_how that can happen although that_s not an_excuse -PRON- should hire more\/better staff
i consider myslef lucky since i do_not have a bad_experience
and i actually love -PRON- good
-PRON- have the chicken shchnitzel be cook just right not dry at all
and the side_dish be very good as_well
one of -PRON- friend have the wrong pizza deliver to -PRON- and have to wait a very long_time for -PRON- food to come but everyone_else seem content
the outside area have a very_nice view when the weather be nice which be almost never in_toronto so again as a visitor i consider -PRON- lucky since -PRON- be a very_nice day
-PRON- probably would not go_back there just because there be plenty_of good option around_town
good service -PRON- have ever have at any fast_food joint
-PRON- have be to
the manager and crew be sooo nice
the other_review of this costa be way outdated and not accurate anymore
-PRON- find this costa to be one of the clean nice and well round location that -PRON- have be to since arrive in scotland
the lobby be nice and have the good seating -PRON- have see in a costa -leather seat all over the place and leather sofa
the lobby be clean and the barista be nice
the customer_service be very good during -PRON- visit there with -PRON- barista even offer -PRON- a glass and ice for a non costa drink that -PRON- have with -PRON-
the clientele of this_location seem old and a_bit wealthy if -PRON- be honest
-PRON- be not_sure if that be truly accurate but during -PRON- visit -PRON- see several nicely dress old lady read in corner with old man who be also dress nicely talk business on -PRON- mobile phone
if -PRON- be right that mean this costa location have to be a cut above some of the other location that primarily serve local student or young people
-PRON- would for sure come_back here again if -PRON- be in the area
-PRON- only_gripe about this_location be that -PRON- have trouble connect to the wifi
good pizza in urbana champaign
love -PRON-
-PRON- can_not get anything as good as this pizza anywhere_else
the deep_dish be a must
fun mom and pop breakfast joint with old_school mel 's diner charm
huge menu
all of the carb laden glucose spiking breakfast goodness that one craf
plus lot_of preparation of egg
and vegetarian item
and the kind_of breakfast stuff that -PRON- grandma would make like chipped beef
bottomless refill of coffee
good service
good sized_portion of food -PRON- will not walk_away hungry
super reasonable_price
definitely a keeper
find this_place in a yelp search a while back
the wife and -PRON- be look for some deep_dish pizza and see amore
-PRON- have a great time the service be excellent and -PRON- have be back a couple time -PRON- live in la
so -PRON- be not a local joint for -PRON-
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_place
be warn that if -PRON- get a deep_dish -PRON- do take a_bit of time to cook size and all
but -PRON- be so worth -PRON-
-PRON- get stick in_vegas with a blown head gasket
pacific auto be fantastic
-PRON- repair -PRON- vehicle quickly and give -PRON- ride to\/from hotel
-PRON- be honest and go out of -PRON- way to try to finish the repair in less time than -PRON- quote
price be competitive and do_not increase even_though -PRON- find the job to be hard than -PRON- anticipate
-PRON- would go_back to -PRON- first next_time
always the good option
-PRON- get the louisiana chicken pasta every_time
-PRON- have only try a couple other plate but this one be always -PRON- number one choose
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to any pasta lover
yuummmmmmm
-PRON- decide to try hash house a go go after_read several positive yelp_review
-PRON- be a little put off when -PRON- get to the imperial palace location at approximately 1 pm
the line\/wait be insane and the crowd be already extra loud and extra drunk
blame -PRON- on sunday_afternoon football
-PRON- guess
-PRON- call the plaza location and be kindly informed that there be no wait at the moment
-PRON- make way over and be seat_immediately
-PRON- server be awesome and attentive and the food be delicious
-PRON- husband order the chicken and waffle along_with a side of biscuit and gravy and -PRON- order the infamous andys sage fry_chicken w\/spinach and chipotle cream
everything be so good
-PRON- accidentally order the wrong andys dish and -PRON- offer to take -PRON- to go while -PRON- order the correct dish but the gentleman_who bring -PRON- food over say not to worry_about -PRON- and get the right dish out to -PRON- in no time
-PRON- be extremely nice of -PRON- consider -PRON- be the one who make the mistake
service be a little_slow towards the end but not enough to make -PRON- think anything less of the place
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- dining_experience there and definitely look_forward_to go_back
-PRON- sushi be the good in_madison and trust -PRON-
-PRON- have be to every sushi place there be in_madison
on_top_of -PRON- amazing sushis -PRON- chicken lettuce_wrap and crab_cake be great as_well
the only_reason -PRON- be give -PRON- a 4_star instead_of a 5 be that -PRON- be a little expensive
-PRON- have be here for like 10 time with -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- have to spend at_least 75 buck each_time
-PRON- eat a lot
anyways this be a great place to have a date at or just hang_out with friend
-PRON- go and get take out last fri night
price be comparable to other bbq place
-PRON- say -PRON- style be arizona and also do south carolina sauce
the pull_pork_sandwich be pretty_good and a good size the rib be decent if -PRON- have just get those -PRON- would be more toward maybe 4 but a solid 3.5 at the very least
-PRON- get brisket
the bottom of -PRON- box be leave very oily while the meat be super dry
another thing that knock -PRON- be the fact_that the counter girl could_not tell -PRON- anything about anything on the menu or -PRON- style of bbq
doubt -PRON- will give -PRON- another try since -PRON- have the awesome tx style place down the street from -PRON-
awesome and quick service
delicious pizza sub and salad
the perfect order in for a late study night and very_helpful staff -PRON- deliver to the place
awesome show
-PRON- love mj and be so super_excited when -PRON- bf surprise -PRON- with ticket because -PRON- have be want to go forever
-PRON- have 3rd row seat which be awesome
this show have much_more dancing than other cirque_show -PRON- have see but still the dancer be incredible
there be even a dude with one leg who dance better_than -PRON- ever could
-PRON- be really in awe watch -PRON- perform and think -PRON- be so cool that -PRON- be able_to partake in the show
-PRON- even have a solo act
all of the costume be on point
besides the dancer the ticket checker and the usher all be dress like mj which really add to the feel of the show
-PRON- play a lot_of michael 's big hit and some less know song as_well
-PRON- favorite part be the man
in the mirror performance -PRON- have a hologramm michael on stage
so -PRON- look_like -PRON- be really up there dance with the crew
-PRON- also really like the thriller scene
the only_reason -PRON- give -PRON- 4_star be because -PRON- do_not_care for the storyline
-PRON- seem unnecessary
-PRON- would have enjoy the show without -PRON- because -PRON- have a hard time follow -PRON-
-PRON- have see a_few different cirque_show and while this one be not as cirque y
be that a word
as other -PRON- like this one the good
awesome happy_hour price and everything fry -PRON- can_imagine
except animal testicle -PRON- do_not have those
now -PRON- be use a hand hold drill to buff toenail during -PRON- pedi instead_of just a quick file
-PRON- can definitely see grow out difference on -PRON- nail bed
not good
come on -PRON- birthday with -PRON- boyfriend on a saturday_night and recently find out that -PRON- have just start to do dinner service on the weekend in 2016
the place be small can sit roughly 18\/20 people inside the restaurant so -PRON- may seem cramp or overwhelming have to share close corner with other diner
-PRON- start out with the cured meat sharing platter not show on the menu online however suggest by the waitress
-PRON- enjoy the platter but notice the other diner have the similar sharing platter but with cure meat
-PRON- be not until -PRON- be finish that the meat be miss so the waitress be able_to take a deduction off -PRON- bill
note to self remember the cure meat
-PRON- look delicious
-PRON- also share the prosciutto pizza and -PRON- be like a bite from italy
although -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- be not cultured in_term_of italian food the waitress be patient enough to help explain the menu and help with the confusion
a big plus be how affordable and inexpensive
the meal overall be
the food alone be good but the service be what really make this_place worth -PRON-
right when -PRON- walk_in -PRON- be greet_by the waitress and the chef
-PRON- take -PRON- jacket and make_sure -PRON- feel_welcome
this night in particular the oven apparently break_down so -PRON- take over_an_hour for the food the prosciutto pizza to be specific to come
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- be in no rush
so -PRON- do_not seem to notice how long the wait be until the waitress keep apologize to -PRON- offer -PRON- an_extra drink and side such_as mini meatball on the house
even the chef come up to -PRON- to apologize for the wait
typically wait that long for a pizza -PRON- would have go up and leave however the service and friendly manner -PRON- give -PRON- make -PRON- stay and wait
after -PRON- food arrive and -PRON- be about to get the bill the waitress offer -PRON- a complimentary espresso and a slice of tiramisu
-PRON- can_not control what_happen to the equipment of the kitchen but -PRON- can control the service -PRON- give to -PRON- patron
so the service be well_worth the visit

after unsuccessful negotiation -PRON- eventually leave and buy a car from tempe honda shortly thereafter with a much easy transaction -PRON- neglect to ensure -PRON- have get -PRON- credit_card back from the salesman
-PRON- hope -PRON- enjoy -PRON- trip to whataburger and quicktrip that day
-PRON- be on -PRON- buddy
this_place a great burger and -PRON- house make fry cheese_curd be amazing
-PRON- only problem be that -PRON- forget to put bacon on -PRON- friend chicken wrap
the server do go to the kitchen and get -PRON- a big handful after -PRON- tell -PRON- but the kitchen should not have make a mistake like that
not when -PRON- be pay over $_10 for a sandwich
-PRON- will still go_back and give -PRON- another_chance
please just do_not forget something next_time
-PRON- pressure -PRON- repeatedly to get invisalign despite the fact_that -PRON- clearly say -PRON- be not interested the first_time
-PRON- also give -PRON- a fluoride treatment without inform -PRON- beforehand not cover by -PRON- insurance and like some of the other_reviewer tell -PRON- -PRON- have two cavity when -PRON- have never have any before in -PRON- life
do_not trust this_place

the food be great the service be great and the founder brian come and make -PRON- experience all the good
-PRON- will be back and -PRON- will be stop in at -PRON- myrtle beach jacksonville wilmington location and all other 19 location

not even note on the floor guide
-PRON- guess -PRON- be not kid when -PRON- name -PRON- secret_pizza
when -PRON- find secret_pizza on_yelp -PRON- bookmark this restaurant
suggest -PRON- girlfriend to go here during -PRON- vegas trip
-PRON- decide to go on saturday_night before marquee
so -PRON- go around 8:30_pm
get to first floor of cosmopolitan and look_at the floor guide by the escalator
look for secret_pizza but nothing
scan the board again and do_not see a word of pizza
-PRON- get slightly scared that maybe -PRON- have the wrong hotel in mind and ask the hotel employee and -PRON- joke that -PRON- be a secret_pizza so -PRON- be a secret
and -PRON- can_not share the location
o_o
-PRON- be one step before panic and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be on the third floor
phew
secret_pizza be tuck_away behind wall
can only get to -PRON- if -PRON- walk_into a narrow hallway next to some restaurant
no sign or anything what so ever so keep an eye out for a narrow hallway that make -PRON- question where -PRON- be lead to
barely_any line at 8:30_pm
too_bad -PRON- be already too full from all the beer -PRON- drink but still take few_bite of the pizza
like everyone say -PRON- be thin_crust pizza with mountain of cheesy goodness
sure the pizza may turn_out a_bit greasy cuz of all the cheese but do_not be shy
just blot -PRON- with some napkin and brace -PRON- for some nice ny_style_pizza
:d ps
-PRON- white pizza be the good
treat -PRON- and indulge in the greasy goodness
second_time here
-PRON- always end_up get the butchers block special feed 2 people
tas the awesome bartender take_care_of -PRON- and have a chance to meet and converse with one of the chef_'s hansel
amazing food delicious drink and yummy dessert
wonderpho
ahh haa -PRON- get -PRON-
if this restaurant fail -PRON- be the complete fault of the owner
why the hell would anyone open a vietnamese noodle eatery here
the business solely depend_on the few urban sprawl office and one business building at the corner
do -PRON- just answer -PRON- own question
cleanest pho restaurant in_toronto front of house anyway
-PRON- better be because the place look_like a section of sunnybrook hospital
-PRON- be get hospital colour and even tin pottery
-PRON- totally sell those at sunnybrook
so -PRON- get bamboo vas
this feel more like a gift_shop than a restaurant
-PRON- do have a patio but who eat pho on a patio
-PRON- know that zesty flavour in the soup
well the pho here have too_much of that
taste unnatural taste_like package spice rather_than fresh one
either that or too_much msg
-PRON- can definitely taste the taste of cut corner
the lemongrass chicken_breast be not outstanding either not tender enough
-PRON- think -PRON- be call the chicken com
frozen meat that be be in the freezer for too_long not enough flavour that be what -PRON- taste_like
-PRON- would like to see the chef and inspect the kitchen
but really -PRON- do_not
the waitress here be quite nice one of -PRON- have a blonde streak at the ponytail
not that be -PRON- be important or any way relevant but -PRON- be what -PRON- have notice so -PRON- think -PRON- write this down
-PRON- be so bored and there be nothing to do here
the place be nearly empty and the food here be not fresh
the plate of sprout be old and -PRON- only give -PRON- one plate despite that there be two of -PRON- and -PRON- both order pho
-PRON- kid -PRON-
-PRON- be bean_sprout
should -PRON- share napkin too
-PRON- do notice that -PRON- have a bunch_of selection in the pho area different kind_of soup base with different noodle
perhaps this be -PRON- selling point
-PRON- be still bored
-PRON- be be hard on this_place because the borderline theme park of a restaurant be just around the corner dragon pearl
this_place need to offer some kind_of niche
-PRON- just can_not imagine why -PRON- would want to come_back here
spend some time in get fresh_ingredient not so_much time in come up with the clever name
oh and -PRON- order the apple juice
-PRON- be from concentrate
-PRON- recently have a thread ask milwaukee yelper for a local yummy bagel place where -PRON- put the cream_cheese on the bagel for -PRON-

never mind -PRON- be eat the bad thing ever
but -PRON- be damn tasty
and -PRON- definitely hit the spot especially with the hell
-PRON- go_through
for some_reason tim_horton 's at_least in_toronto do_not have ice_coffee
brake slam what
-PRON- do_not understand -PRON-
and what -PRON- do_not understand even more be that most of the torontonians that -PRON- see be all drink hot coffee ok -PRON- know this be toronto but -PRON- manage to go during a terrible heat wave
so -PRON- boggle -PRON- mind even more
-PRON- have these ice cappachino thing that be basically like dd 's coffee coolatas and -PRON- really be not a fan_of -PRON- -PRON- be however cheap that dd 's version
probably will not be get those again
now if only -PRON- go with ice_coffee -PRON- may get that last star
just go here with -PRON- mom for breakfast

-PRON- be awaken due_to itching and -PRON- feel as if something bite -PRON-
-PRON- want to go_somewhere far but not too_far because of some craziness -PRON- be go_through in life and find this amazing spot on the east side of vegas
this park be know as the secret park of clark county and be the perfect place for a quick getaway
walking trail be about_an_hour long
-PRON- can_not see the strip or other building
walk on -PRON- trail be calming
all -PRON- hear be bird chirp and rabbit run through the bush
what be even good be that -PRON- can experience all of this for free
-PRON- do_not want to write a review about this_place because -PRON- be a perfect getaway but for people_who need a quick break or look to meditate this be the perfect spot
walk breathe relax
-PRON- all need -PRON- once in a while

-PRON- be a tiny little shop operate out of a transform cargo container and can_not fit more_than 3 or 4_people at once
the decor be adorable as be the macaron box
the size of the macaron be quite substantial
-PRON- split a half_dozen box with two friend
-PRON- cost about $_14 total
-PRON- try the nimbus and hk style milk_tea flavour and both be delicious
the nimbus one be very light and fluffy and the hk milk_tea one taste exactly like hk milk_tea down to the tea flavour and creaminess that -PRON- love
the only_downside be that the hk milk_tea macaron be hard when -PRON- have -PRON- but -PRON- suspect that have to do with the fact_that -PRON- be out in the cold for a long_time so -PRON- possibly froze\/harden
none_of the other one that -PRON- friend have have any problem
10\/10 would go_back and try the other flavour
the medical staff be awesome the nurse practitioner su be a delight
however the front_desk_staff be extremely_rude -PRON- work in a very busy office service the public and -PRON- can_not imagine treat people this way and keep -PRON- job
-PRON- be not a patient -PRON- husband be
the wait to see someone be hour long
robert bloomberg may be a great doctor but -PRON- staff suck
look for a place to get a drink and food near the hyatt come_across this_place

-PRON- go here recently for a friend birthday
-PRON- have rent a cabana so -PRON- do_not have to fight w\/ the crowd or to get a table which be nice
the cabana be spacious and relatively cool because of the mister
-PRON- waitress be surprisingly attentive yet unenthusiastic
-PRON- keep forget -PRON- dds drink
and the drink be average
the only real complaint -PRON- have be that -PRON- keep turn of the mister to the cabana make -PRON- unbearably hot
the mister stay on the rest_of the patio just not the area where people pay extra to sit which just seem wrong to -PRON-
menu say crap puffs that should have be -PRON- first clue
egg flour soup look_like snot
lemon chkn = grill chkn piece with goo
there be three of -PRON- and two of -PRON- be serve together
when -PRON- finally decide that -PRON- have completely forget one meal and get up to leave as -PRON- all share the two meal and be finish eat
-PRON- bring the third meal

-PRON- be in the booth which be ideal size to sit comfortable for 5 6 people
portion be okay and pricing be on the high_end
but -PRON- pay for what -PRON- get
the meat quality be very good
what set this_place apart be the service
the server come to cook -PRON- meat and serve to each person on the table

chadol daenjang jjigae $ 10.99 r9
dolsot bulgogi bibimbab $ 10.99 seafood pancake which be on a different hide menu -PRON- have to ask for
$ 14.99
everything -PRON- order be good except for the seafood pancake which be tasteless
-PRON- have to add -PRON- own salt to -PRON-
-PRON- should have know -PRON- be not good when -PRON- see the table beside -PRON- only eat 1\/4 of -PRON- and do_not even want to pack -PRON- to go when -PRON- leave
at first -PRON- only give -PRON- the corn and edamme bean banchens
-PRON- have to ask the server if there be any_other different_type
-PRON- say no
but after 5_min -PRON- come_back with 8 different_type
so -PRON- be kinda confused why -PRON- say no to -PRON-
-PRON- be not_sure
but -PRON- be extremely thirsty after eat_here

after fax a claim leave 2 voice mail -PRON- finally get a call back from a manager well over a week_later
-PRON- say that -PRON- wash thousand of car a week and have no incident so there be no way -PRON- machine cause say damage
-PRON- probably due_to -PRON- truck be a 2003 and have old wear out part ready to break

the cheap -PRON- have find the mirror for be $ 350
so know that go_through this car be at -PRON- own risk

the selection of tent be almost addictive -PRON- have four from there now who need that many
-PRON- wife often ask and -PRON- smile -PRON-
the only_reason -PRON- do_not give -PRON- 5_star be the location seem hectic at time be so close to the mall wish -PRON- be off site of the mall but for some this may be a plus
integrity glass be amazing
-PRON- front windshield be break and then come to -PRON- home the next_day after call and fix -PRON-
-PRON- do_an_amazing job and be so helpful and nice
-PRON- really_appreciate the work -PRON- do and how easy -PRON- make -PRON- for -PRON-

but -PRON- do
there be a lot_of chatter and laugh in the dining_area but how could that possibly be a bad thing

-PRON- feel trick
hand_down good donut shop
-PRON- have be to
great flavor and love that the sweetness factor be just right
definitely try the macadamia coconut donut and peanut_butter jelly
the beverage be also good
if -PRON- be in the vegas area definitely make this a pit stop
worth -PRON-
-PRON- order -PRON- popcorn chicken and bbt
but the popcorn chicken be very bad and so slow
when -PRON- finish -PRON- bbt the chicken be still not ready
when -PRON- want to ask the staff -PRON- see -PRON- chicken -PRON- be no fresh
do_not think -PRON- will come again
if -PRON- want to swim in a pool wake_up without a kink in -PRON- neck and have easy access to -PRON- room while in_las_vegas do_not stay_at the tuscany hotel on flamingo
-PRON- key card never work properly
anytime -PRON- want to enter the building -PRON- have to go to the front_desk to have the key reactivate and even then -PRON- never work on the first try
the pillow that be intend for guest to use for sleeping be so full and overstuff that -PRON- husband and -PRON- both wake_up with stiff neck
-PRON- suggest bring -PRON- own pillow
the weekend -PRON- be in_vegas happen to have record break temperature and what do -PRON- know the pool be out of order
-PRON- understand that these thing happen unfortunately however a resort_fee compensation of $ 23 do_not make up for the fact_that -PRON- child could_not use the pool on the 114 degree day
when -PRON- ask for a deck of card so -PRON- could play war with -PRON- child since -PRON- could_not swim the response be -PRON- have -PRON- in the gift_shop
wow
maybe eat the cost of a $_5 deck to make -PRON- guest happy
that be not what the tuscany resort be know for -PRON- guess
-PRON- ask -PRON- for a voucher to get a dessert in the restaurant to kill the time since -PRON- could_not swim or play card and -PRON- say -PRON- could only have one form of compensation so which would -PRON- prefer
wow again
-PRON- clearly be not out to make return guest out of people
-PRON- be unfortunate that -PRON- have this experience because -PRON- have stay_here before which be pleasant
sorry tuscany and -PRON- will not be return and -PRON- will be happy to share -PRON- experience with everyone -PRON- know
before leave las_vegas -PRON- buy a_few chocolate from this_place in the wynn esplanade to try back at home
white_chocolate with fruit and nut hazelnut praline wrap in dark_chocolate dark_chocolate disk the size of -PRON- palm and one word to describe -PRON- reaction yum
now this be a reason to go_back to vegas
-PRON- friend and -PRON- go down to watch the ufc and grab some food
-PRON- have the nachos wings and burgers
best tasting be the crack peppercorn burger
on the plus side service be friendly
too_bad the food be so mediocre
-PRON- really think -PRON- could bump -PRON- up a notch
or maybe -PRON- be force to follow a corporate menu
lot_of tv though to watch the fight
well what can -PRON- say about this_place
-PRON- not that bad
but not worth go again
the food be alright but the service could be a lot better
at most kbbq joint -PRON- never have to ask for a bowl of rice to go with the meat -PRON- cook
-PRON- do_not replace the grill until -PRON- have to pull someone aside which be hard to do just to do -PRON-
whenever -PRON- husband want to ask for something -PRON- walk by as if there be no hand raise over anything
now -PRON- be not go to pull out no race card even_though -PRON- be the only cough black people there in the entire restaurant but everyone_else seem to have be take_care_of more_than -PRON- be
sigh -PRON- do_not_matter
-PRON- will not dwell on that
overall the food be good
but -PRON- be not all that
soju and beer be great
-PRON- would prefer to spend -PRON- money elsewhere for kbbq
or -PRON- would not mind go again if -PRON- would have good service
-PRON- book for 2 adult and 1 child and end_up with one queen bed
not_too_bad except small room so a_bit claustrobic at time
have to keep ask for a third set of towel and also for toilet paper as there be only the one roll on the wall
not enough for 3 people for 3 night stay
the bad thing be at night when -PRON- leg be super itchy
woke up and see 3 flea pop about on the window sill
hard to kill but wash down the sink
thought
maybe that be -PRON- but then bite again on the third night and see more on windowsill
be -PRON- kid
-PRON- have not bring -PRON- luggage into the house yet because -PRON- be afraid -PRON- will infest -PRON- home
pay for wifi be ridiculous and -PRON- be pay per device
would not recommend as -PRON- all seem a big crapshoot
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- be go to famous daves across the way and decide to try this_place out for the first_time
and -PRON- have to say -PRON- be the good decision of -PRON- life to do so

-PRON- be decently_price and a lot_of food
the meat be all so perfect
and the staff be super_friendly

oyster wow
scallop melt like butter in -PRON- mouth so perfectly cooked wow and the lamb
very_tasty cook to perfection
the topper and must have basil ice_cream
five_star experience
this be an up and come bar
hopefully -PRON- will_continue to have the clientele -PRON- be center around
-PRON- love the bartender as -PRON- seem very_knowledgeable and down to earth
mixed drink good and center around bourbon and whiskey which be different
location nice upstairs of_course but look down a gelato shop which be different
a good place to have a fancy drink after dinner
and -PRON- do_not only have ginger beer drink
-PRON- will be back
the burger be great but -PRON- guy should provide shade or something to -PRON- poor employee stand outside in full sun in 97 degree az weather
-PRON- have see some of these_guy stand out there for a while
-PRON- be a_bit inhumane in -PRON- opinion
shame on the mgrs -PRON- should have to stand out there with no cover to see_how -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- absolute_favorite place for happy_hour
bartender helen be the good
-PRON- have always take great care of -PRON-
do_not_matter if -PRON- just -PRON- husband and -PRON- or a group_of friend

chris at the front_desk be more_than helpful with -PRON- problem and need
-PRON- def recommend_this_place for quality of service
-PRON- provide -PRON- with
this_place be incredibly addict
-PRON- favorite flavor be muddle chocolate ice_cream with caramel and oreos -PRON- be life change
unfortunately -PRON- run out one night but let -PRON- know -PRON- could make a suitable replacement by add caramel to the chocolate and oreo ice_cream
sound great in theory but -PRON- server add a peanut_butter sauce instead
thank_goodness
-PRON- be not allergic to peanut_butter but -PRON- do_not like the taste at all
and -PRON- taint the rest_of the ice_cream
but clearly -PRON- have put that night behind -PRON- and continue to frequent the creamery -PRON- be addict
-PRON- just make_sure to keep the delicious ice_cream topping less -PRON- do_not need any addition
-PRON- go here this morning to pick_up some coffee and bagel for -PRON- family and i.
-PRON- be very_helpful and courteous
there be a confusion on -PRON- order but -PRON- be -PRON- fault
-PRON- be easily fix and -PRON- really_appreciate the excellent customer_service
everything be neatly package and cup utensil be in the bag without -PRON- ask
-PRON- go around 8 a.m. and the place be pack so that should say something
-PRON- be a starbucks snob
but -PRON- will_definitely reconsider -PRON- coffee choice
incredible food
since -PRON- move to stuttgart one of -PRON- favorite food have be the maultaschen
-PRON- be check_out store in the town and decide to stop in for lunch
-PRON- husband and -PRON- split the curry maultaschen and the classic
both be incredible
the classic be a maultaschen on a roll with onion and bacon yum
-PRON- will_definitely be back and next_time -PRON- be try to the potato_salad
just note there be not the wide drink selection because the place be small
also there be not a ton_of seating so if -PRON- want to eat there instead_of take -PRON- to go
-PRON- would suggest check -PRON- out before\/after lunch rush
make -PRON- to this_place today with -PRON- family service be good but the food be really bad will not go there again
-PRON- can_not recommend -PRON- service highly_enough
-PRON- be easy to speak with someone_who understand -PRON- issue and to schedule a service when -PRON- need -PRON- to come by
rich -PRON- technician be excellent
very_friendly and professional and do a good job diagnose the issue
even_though -PRON- require a return visit -PRON- own -PRON- issue and come_back to complete the repair\/install -PRON-
many thank
well when everything_else be close at 4am and mandalay_bay room service wait time be 2_hour there be nothing leave but subway and citizens

chicken noodle_soup be not pleasing to -PRON- easily pleased drunk tastebud
nachos be good but when be nachos never good
oh and another thing -PRON- have a party of 6 but only 4 of -PRON- be present at the time
hostess would only seat -PRON- at a table for 4 and say -PRON- can move to a big table when the rest_of the party arrive
-PRON- meaaaaan the restaurant be practically empty at 4 a.m. but
okay
-PRON- take -PRON- foodie group to rooneys and love -PRON-

the staff be responsive and on the ball even_though this_place be pack
wine on_tap be a great option however the wine menu be confusing
and -PRON- have adopt the new five and eight
let -PRON- cheap out -PRON- customer and squeeze more buck
give that beer have not change in decade -PRON- be pretty insulting as a wine drinker
the food option be extensive and the special be creative and affordable
get off the wine greed bandwagon and -PRON- will give -PRON- an_extra star
this_place be so awesome
-PRON- absolutely_love the customer_service and the drink be yummy just like the food
sadly -PRON- come_here on -PRON- last day in_vegas but -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- next_time -PRON- come to vegas
-PRON- be definitely_return here
well -PRON- really can_not say anything bad but why a 1_star well because -PRON- make_an_appointment for -PRON- son max who be a 3_year old shih tzu pekingese maltese on_tuesday
-PRON- appointment be at 10 a.m. -PRON- drop -PRON- off
-PRON- just move here -PRON- baby get regularly groom with no issue
-PRON- growl at -PRON-
-PRON- ask if -PRON- bite i say only kid when -PRON- do something to -PRON-
because that be all -PRON- see
so -PRON- keep -PRON- away_from kid
-PRON- take -PRON- from -PRON- just fine
-PRON- walk to the dollar store not even 5_minute later -PRON- call say -PRON- be try to bite -PRON-
-PRON- need to pick -PRON- up
-PRON- be upsetting because -PRON- really need to be groom
-PRON- immediately leave the store to pick -PRON- up
-PRON- do offer to try again friday morning first appointment that be nice
but after -PRON- tell -PRON- husband what_happen -PRON- think -PRON- be weird because -PRON- be always good at get groom tell -PRON- to find some place else
-PRON- call another groomer take -PRON- there yesterday thursday -PRON- let -PRON- know_what happen so -PRON- can be aware -PRON- take max from -PRON-
-PRON- go just find i hang_out to see_how -PRON- will act
not surprisingly -PRON- go on the table
just fine sit like a good boy get groom so -PRON- leave
-PRON- be unfortunate because -PRON- read so_many great review on yuppie
-PRON- really want -PRON- to be -PRON- baby new groomer
-PRON- just wish -PRON- would of give -PRON- a chance to get to know -PRON-
have a later dinner here at 9:45 on saturday_night with 5 of -PRON- girlfriend
the food be all amazing and the service be awesome as_well
the price_range and diversity of the wine menu be great something for everyone
for be so late -PRON- do_not feel_rush or push out
very enjoyable
-PRON- have half price happy_hour on all drink
-PRON- order an_iced mocha which be a drink and -PRON- refuse to give -PRON- the discount
mind
-PRON- an_iced mocha be milk a shot of espresso chocolate syrup and ice aka a drink
-PRON- still refuse and tell -PRON- that an_iced mocha be an ice_cream -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- try the summerlicious dinner menu at splendido for $ 45
have the beef tongue sea_bass and panna cotta
-PRON- be all delicious but the standout be the beef tongue
the sea_bass be a little too minimal in flavor but -PRON- be very soft and well cooked
-PRON- also enjoy the basil cucumber lemonade
the location be somewhat random as -PRON- be not near many_other restaurant or shop and the room -PRON- do_not have fancy design or decor
however the service be top_notch friendly and efficient
-PRON- server be cheerful and predict -PRON- need before -PRON- know -PRON-
the support staff who bring_out the food could use some extra training on the menu_item most high_end restaurant do a little good when deliver and explain the dish to guest
-PRON- be fine here but almost near whisper basic description this be the sea_bass
-PRON- would definitely be back to try the regular menu as the food be delicious and if the service be this excellent during summerlicious which let -PRON- face -PRON- be a time when many restaurant will revert to factory style serve with more customer than -PRON- be use to
then -PRON- imagine the regular experience be superb
a note about portion_size -PRON- be small perhaps small than many_other high_end restaurant -PRON- rather like this because -PRON- allow -PRON- to get through the entire menu without feel too full but -PRON- can see_how -PRON- would feel inadequate to a hungry or large person
as a point of reference the panna cotta be slightly small in circumference than a hockey puck perhaps closer to a loonie
just something to consider before make -PRON- choice
-PRON- have hear from friend that splendido consistently have an_excellent summerlicious\/winterlicious menu and -PRON- have deliver this year as_well
medina be a good wee club to visit if -PRON- want all -PRON- drink for £ 2.00 and -PRON- enjoy a night of standing and dancing which be not a bad way to spend -PRON- night
there be a_few seat around the dance_floor and a_few booth behind the dj bit
the floor area be not huge but be cosy
there be about five or six staff behind the bar and once -PRON- dodge -PRON- way_through all the people on the dance_floor service be really quite good
the dj be call nasty p but be actually quite a nice guy
-PRON- play lot_of hip_hop r&b and rap music but there be lot_of other classic track from a wide_variety of artist like ac\/dc dusty springfield gorillaz and jackie wilson
like most club in the student area of edinburgh there be no sign of any loutish behaviour
everyone seem to be out for a fun night and there be not a noticeable bouncer presence
-PRON- would visit this_place again
the only criticism -PRON- have the whole night be when a member of staff be collect empty glass in -PRON- knock over a full can of beer and -PRON- pour all over the stage area
-PRON- be quite a big puddle
-PRON- think -PRON- be be helpful by point -PRON- out to the girl that spill -PRON- but -PRON- just say that the rest_of the floor would be wet soon
-PRON- suppose the dancer do all have -PRON- drink in -PRON- hand but -PRON- probably would have be a good idea to mop -PRON- up a_bit
later on a guy slip and land with -PRON- back on the ridge of the stage
-PRON- quickly get up and incorporate -PRON- into -PRON- dance move to pretend that -PRON- mean -PRON-
-PRON- have be go to this_location about 1.5 2 year before -PRON- be gentle dental mainly for dr honigman periodontist who be excellent by the way

1_hour and 45_minute later -PRON- be out the door
really
and -PRON- be the first patient for -PRON- hygienist
-PRON- be not -PRON- fault -PRON- understand but come on
oh and this be after a 1_hour and 30_minute appointment 7.30 a.m. 9 a few_week before for -PRON- 7 year_old son who have a cleaning really just an eval and polish and x_ray
meanwhile -PRON- daughter schedule at the same time for the same procedure with a different hygienist be do in under an_hour
also whoever be in charge of -PRON- billing\/accounting department need to be fire
-PRON- have not clear up charge from -PRON- very first_visit in early 2016 even_though -PRON- insurance_company have advise the practice -PRON- need more information\/documentation from the practice in order to pay the open claim
-PRON- have mention this to -PRON- almost every_single_time -PRON- have be in yet still nothing have be do
-PRON- be be how many month and the a\/c still be not fix
major fail
nice look place just need to get -PRON- act together
another groupon casualty
-PRON- buy several groupons for this_location and use only one
then -PRON- go to go use another one the other day
and bam -PRON- be go
another one bite the dust
return factor an obvious 0
same as before
plan on go to walmart for -PRON- oil_change but -PRON- could_not get -PRON- oil filter off
so -PRON- have to come_back to this pep boys
the mechanic bobby brown screw the filter on too tight -PRON- dad could_not get -PRON- off or -PRON- would have change the filter as_well_as -PRON- oil and about 3 of the guy from walmart could_not get -PRON- off
what a pain to drive all the way from concord to come_back here to get -PRON- to get the oil filter off easily and especially as a broke college student not to even get a discount for -PRON- time
this be one of the good nail_salon -PRON- have ever be to -PRON- gel_manicure always last for well over 2_week
-PRON- have only have one bad_experience in the year that -PRON- have be go to envy
-PRON- gel mani be very rough and bumpy but when -PRON- return a few_week later the nail_technician who do -PRON- manicure be no_longer work there
clearly -PRON- care_about quality
just make_sure -PRON- allow lot_of time for -PRON- service -PRON- seem_like -PRON- be always busy and there be usually some wait time even if -PRON- have an_appointment
-PRON- give -PRON- one_star because -PRON- could_not give -PRON- zero
2_hour for delivery and the person on the phone just keep say -PRON- be -PRON- neighborhood
finally call and tell the to cancel -PRON-
but -PRON- half expect -PRON- to still charge -PRON-
the pizza here be awesome
make -PRON- own with the margarita sauce
-PRON- can taste the freshness in the sauce and topping
also order a salad
-PRON- be plenty for -PRON- wife and i.

-PRON- have be to biscuits before and -PRON- will_continue to choose -PRON- over any_other breakfast joint
happy to see that building get some good business
price be reasonable portion be large and the atmosphere be comparable to granny 's kitchen
highly_recommend the chichen fry_steak
food be so good
-PRON- have a new menu out with new pasta dish and pizza 's
service be great -PRON- deliver also
-PRON- food be like have a restaurant like olive_garden deliver to -PRON-
the average delivery time for -PRON- be about 35_minute pick_up be 12 minute
matt and northstar services be terrific
matt be punctual call to confirm -PRON- arrival time and really do a superior job under difficult condition
-PRON- laundry room be small with a front loading washer and dryer set in minimal space but -PRON- clear over 30 year of build up dryer lint from -PRON- drier to -PRON- roof exhaust
-PRON- actually leave the system good_than what -PRON- find -PRON- and give -PRON- some great tip for future upkeep
-PRON- would not hesitate to have northstar back and will recommend matt and -PRON- company to all -PRON- friend
dissapoint 16 buck for a greek scramble and pecan pancake 2 coffee scramble be over cook portion be probably a cup
customer_service fail to tell -PRON- about all -PRON- can eat french_toast and pancake also fail to inform -PRON- of loyalty card -PRON- have to read these thing on sign -PRON- have hang
tuck in a sketchy strip_mall anchor by a family dollar so that should tell -PRON- something be a gem of a restaurant call bistro la bon
blink and -PRON- will miss -PRON- no joke
but foodie in the clt know a terrific restaurant and an even good sunday_brunch no_matter where the eatery may be
-PRON- like the cozy intimate decor
plenty_of persian style rug line the hardwood and the lighting and atmosphere lend -PRON- to conversation and laugh
-PRON- be a terrific place to bring a date or a group_of friend and family for a great meal
the sunday_brunch be bistro la bon 's raison d'etre
keep in mind the buffet be rather small so if -PRON- be expect a golden corral sized diy helping -PRON- will be slightly disappoint
-PRON- love that -PRON- buffet serve also come with complimentary scramble_egg chocolate waffle thick cut bacon and buttery french_toast
for real
and yes -PRON- be complimentary
-PRON- say such nice thing_about -PRON-
(*groan
one thing to watch out for if -PRON- love -PRON- bloody_mary drown in tabasco then -PRON- will love -PRON- here
-PRON- -PRON- like -PRON- not so spicy
-PRON- struggle mightily try to finish mine but -PRON- simply throw in the towel
no shame in admit -PRON- do_not have enough hair on -PRON- chest to finish this spicy bastard

so for what -PRON- be worth blb be fast become one of -PRON- go to spot for sunday_brunch
in_fact -PRON- may need to drag the missus and the wee wonder this sunday
-PRON- love_this_place
5_star all the way
but texas de brazil be good if -PRON- be to choose for dinner option
why
texas the most amazing salad_bar of any buffet in_las_vegas with virtually the same meat
14 cut to be exact
with that be say the meat at fogo be a hair tasty
minus the hair in -PRON-
all the cut here be very lightly season as_oppose to texas which heavily salt -PRON- meat
-PRON- like -PRON- cut medium_rare so lightly salt taste better
towards the end of the meal when -PRON- like -PRON- medium well so the heavily salt sear piece be good
this only work with -PRON- rib eye here
in_fact -PRON- will only want to eat rib eye here
-PRON- be -PRON- good cut
and -PRON- sure give generous_portion per cut
so with a poor salad_bar and slightly tasty meat why a 5_star

for local and close eat this be where -PRON- go
lunch time in the city
and -PRON- be feel japanese -PRON- really think so
kabuki japanese restaurant be not so bad
yeh -PRON- be a chain but where_else would -PRON- be able_to enjoy a meal of vegetarian variety that -PRON- look_forward_to when dining out
kabuki 's menu be extensive and the vegetarian selection be clearly mark
authentic restaurant may have extensive menu too but -PRON- just do_not understand non meat living
soooo folk who want authenticity should stay_away
in_fact just skip this review entirely because -PRON- be not for -PRON-
lunch for four at kabuki be not expensive at all and -PRON- walk_away with a satisfied palate and fill tummy
a small house salad side of ginger and wasabi accompany the meal
love that tasty ginger
-PRON- be ginger colour and marinate just right not the pink overly sweeten pickle store buy stuff
-PRON- top everything with -PRON- and have to ask for an_extra serving
here be the food -PRON- decide on spicy veggie ramen
this be good
spicy broth with noodle kale onion and bean_sprout
the noodle be a nice texture and very long
the amount_of kale be perfect but still the soup be lack something fill
like mushroom
-PRON- would have love to have some mushroom
sautéed asparagus come in teriyaki sauce
great sauce
take this sauce and mix with the ginger
oh_yeah
that be how -PRON- do condiment
sweet_potato fries
who be a sucker for fry
meeee
-PRON- would probably order fry in a candy store if -PRON- could
steamed vegetables small_plate of steamed kabocha a type_of squash mushroom asparagus red bell pepper broccoli and green_bean
hmmmm now that -PRON- think of -PRON- -PRON- should have put these into -PRON- raman
that would have make a proper bowl of soup
vegetable tempura
-PRON- japanese staple
crunchy and not too oily asparagus rolls and avocado rolls
these be good but -PRON- would not order the asparagus again because -PRON- do_not do anything for the taste of the roll
the avocado roll have a much good bite in_term_of texture and the way the taste meld
horrible place filthy room
the owner mr patel be an a hole resturaun food give -PRON- the run see roach in the room
stay_away
-PRON- always recommend invader pest management to friend and neighbor
-PRON- have keep -PRON- home and lawn pest free for more_than 20_year at a very_reasonable_price
the technician be efficient effective and polite
-PRON- value -PRON- attention to detail and the care -PRON- take of -PRON- property
customer_service not
so great
-PRON- agree with the other so so review of this coffee shop
while the drinks\/food in_general be good there be thing that make this_place lack
on the two occasion -PRON- have be here -PRON- have receive very different service as_well_as very different quality in drink
-PRON- first_visit be pleasant and the people_who serve -PRON- be very_nice fast and make something delicious
the second_visit however be very_disappointing
have -PRON- only be here once -PRON- would have be very upset with the service -PRON- receive on the second_visit and possibly never return
several thing that bother -PRON- in_general be the lackluster service the price and the item that be available
over $_6 for a 16 oz milk_tea seem a bit_pricey consider -PRON- be not of the same quality as other boba place -PRON- have be to
-PRON- brother waffle dessert be also disappointing as -PRON- be $_8 for three waffle stick and about a tablespoon of ice_cream
on_top_of the cost -PRON- do_not have a container to accommodate this dessert when order to go
-PRON- probably would not have be as bother by these factor if the customer_service be good but one of the worker who take -PRON- order seem to not want to be there
-PRON- refer -PRON- to the menu when -PRON- could_not describe an item -PRON- recommend
-PRON- drink also do_not have a hint_of what -PRON- have order as an add on yet -PRON- be charge for -PRON-
-PRON- be also out of several item on the menu and out of stock in regard to bottle
all thing say -PRON- would probably only return if -PRON- improve customer_service and provide better to go container
-PRON- guess -PRON- will still have to travel to china town for good boba
a few_week_ago -PRON- be in_town for a business event
-PRON- want a really good steak and boy do -PRON- get -PRON-
the bone in filet be hand_down the good steak -PRON- have ever have
and -PRON- have have a lot_of steak
the side crab_cake and salad -PRON- have be also amazing
the drink
killer
-PRON- can_not remember the name of -PRON- but -PRON- signature drink be a vodka soak with pineapple and not only be -PRON- huge
-PRON- want another one
for the quality of the meat and the service -PRON- think the price be spot on
-PRON- be a_bit disappointed that -PRON- advertise a dress code and there be people in there with jean on
-PRON- wish -PRON- would enforce that
-PRON- feel_like -PRON- just walk_into the seven level of shitty hair metal hell
the story be over the top cheesy with nothing but 2_hour of blowjob joke for both the straight and gay persuasion
the only_thing give this a second star be the immense amount_of eye candy steer -PRON- eye away_from the rest_of the garbage production
thank the universe
-PRON- get these ticket for free
-PRON- sit in the rockstar section(first three row and -PRON- cost 182 buck
there be six of -PRON- top 1100 dollar for the entire experience
rip_off
if -PRON- be middle_aged and hammer off ten whiskey sour -PRON- would have love this show
-PRON- would have see -PRON- belt out absurd lyric about vagina innuendo while wish to -PRON- that -PRON- be tommy lee
unfortunately for roa -PRON- parent actually teach -PRON- what good music should sound_like
spoof show only have the fizzle of the music selection -PRON- make and hair metal should have kill -PRON- with aid thirty year_ago -PRON- be both very_popular in the 80_'s
-PRON- wish eddie money have -PRON- own vegas show
-PRON- have be go to this salon for over three year
-PRON- will not let anyone touch -PRON- hair
-PRON- be color expert
the moment -PRON- walk_in -PRON- feel loved and comfortable
-PRON- spend all the necessary quality time on -PRON- offer -PRON- cucumber or lemon infuse water give -PRON- the good scalp massage and then give -PRON- a nice blow_dry and style to -PRON- hair
worth_every_penny
the cost be reasonable too
the food be delicious
the decor of the venue be whimsically unique
portions be on the small side but the ambience omg definitely_worth the price for the atmosphere
-PRON- will stay with harkins theatres concession cost less and -PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- just get ream in the buttock $_20 for crappy unflavored overpriced popcorn and soda that -PRON- have to get -PRON- now with those coke dispenser that have a million choice and most of the people have to stand there like there at a redbox decide which movie to get
the only_reason -PRON- go to amc be because -PRON- get ticket for -PRON- birthday from -PRON- employer
-PRON- be really easy to shit on the sls
-PRON- try very desperately to be cool and hip and funky funky fresh
in a lot_of way -PRON- succeed
yet -PRON- be poor location on the strip and sparse crowd take a lot away_from the hotel 's potential
-PRON- know_what -PRON- be not go to waste any more of -PRON- time wax poetic about this hotel 's pro and con
here be the bottom_line the basic room be sexy
the bed be flank by floor to ceiling mirror
if -PRON- want to see a different angle of -PRON- lover(s while bang and do_not want to strain -PRON- neck(or -PRON- hotel budget then the sls be for -PRON-
while i do_not eat steak or drink martini i can attest to see at_least 3 celebrity and 4 nfl player do just that fun for drink and people_watch
great food and performance on a friday_night
do try out the grill pineapple -PRON- be to kill for
a bit_pricey but
hey if -PRON- can eat for 3 then -PRON- be very_reasonable
sunday champange brunch
-PRON- suppose everything be good with booz
but -PRON- have a great time
great selection of food and everyt look quality
negative be that -PRON- do_not have a non champagne option for non drinker so -PRON- have to drink twice as much of couse and -PRON- crab be icy
-PRON- have -PRON- boil -PRON-
but -PRON- be so salty -PRON- be ineddible
but -PRON- be no biggy cuz -PRON- keep the mimosa come
this be a popular local hangout spot for youngster and hipster
be here_twice
coffee be not memorable and seating be a_bit crammed
uninteresting book collection reasonably friendly barista
-PRON- order the classic benedict
come with the melted cheese on hashbrown
the ham on the muffin be sweet and tender
egg poach so nicely
highly_recommend for -PRON- starter of the day
-PRON- server kyle be very charsimatic -PRON- will tell -PRON- all the good stuff
-PRON- be considerate about -PRON-
-PRON- sit in a sunny spot out outside and kyle help -PRON- move to a more comfortble shady spot
-PRON- will take real good care of -PRON-
whenever -PRON- have a friend come to town and want to try some local cuisine -PRON- immediately think of the fox restaurant concepts
so_many creative concept and doughbird be one of the late
ironically -PRON- two favorite cuisine be pizza and chicken
what do -PRON- get when -PRON- combine the two
doughbird of_course
-PRON- just go last_night to doughbird for -PRON- second_time since -PRON- have open and to be honest -PRON- be not_sure_why -PRON- do_not go on a regular basis
great concept easy_parking short wait good service and delicious food
during -PRON- first_visit -PRON- guest and -PRON- both share a truffle cheese stromboli appetizer -PRON- order the free range chicken half and -PRON- order carmeliz cauliflower
-PRON- chicken come with macaroni and cheese as a side_dish
-PRON- then order pie for dessert
last_night -PRON- share a pizza and a caesar_salad
note that -PRON- can have a pizza personalize as -PRON- wish
-PRON- do_not have to stick with the option give on the menu though -PRON- do sound pretty_good
all the food taste delicious
-PRON- only thought be that the price be a_bit high for pizza or chicken and again as a fan_of both food -PRON- would be amazing to have a combination of pizza and chicken in one dish
perhaps a slice of pizza and some chicken
-PRON- be sure the restaurant can think up something more creative than that
also the menu should mention that pizza can be personalize
those be just a_few of -PRON- thought
the restaurant be one of many that can be find on the corner of 44th street and indian school road southwest corner
both time -PRON- find -PRON- with many option for parking and only a short wait upon_arrival
wait for food take a little while during -PRON- first_visit but be pretty quick during yesterday 's visit
-PRON- do learn after the fact_that -PRON- can make a reservation on -PRON- website or on opentable
when -PRON- sign_up for -PRON- e_mail list -PRON- can get $_10 off a $_20 purchase during -PRON- next_visit

-PRON- husband and -PRON- share an entree
the first dine_in experience -PRON- enjoy koobadeh so delicious and the next_visit -PRON- try solanti
both be excellent
-PRON- must_say the kind attentive service -PRON- have have from different server have be a pleasant surprise
-PRON- almost feel_like -PRON- be din at a friend 's house because -PRON- every need be anticipate
-PRON- also try the salad shirazi -PRON- be pretty_good the yougurt and mint dip absolutely outstanding and the hummus
-PRON- be shocked with how_much -PRON- enjoy the hummus as -PRON- be usually -PRON- husband 's choice and not mine
-PRON- be so fresh_tasting
the price be appropriate for the portion_size
this be a low_key quiet dining kind_of place and be a really great option to try persian food for the first_time as the atmosphere make -PRON- not intimidate for first_timer
also easy to find and get to off of shea blvd and plenty_of free_parking close by

and the price be extremely high
rice with a_few veggie $_14
seriously
-PRON- will not be go_back and neither
will the two other friend -PRON- want with
very good but below -PRON- top tier
appetizers may have be the good -PRON- have have at a steakhouse
steak be very good but not quite up to the good of the good
no som and the wine_selection be decent
this_place be awesome
the sushi be delicious the wait staff attentive and the atmosphere nice
-PRON- foresee -PRON- grow out of this space quickly
-PRON- want to love_this_place
-PRON- love the people and i like the food and -PRON- be so so on the location and decor
ill break this up into two part the good and the bad
so the good be the same that everybody have talk_about as the couple be the sweet people and genuinely want -PRON- to enjoy -PRON- food and leave satisfied
-PRON- mean how many place bring -PRON- sample of food for -PRON- to try even after -PRON- full from -PRON- meal
not many and that give -PRON- the feel of go home to -PRON- grandmother who never want to stop feed -PRON-
both husband and wife be very_nice especially -PRON- interaction with the husband with -PRON- limited korean -PRON- really have a nice conversation
the bad but not totally bad be the location be certainly not setup for date_night or anything more that a super casual location\/spot
and -PRON- just the two that run the place so the wait for -PRON- bill food drink etc could take a_little_bit as -PRON- hard to be demand of such a genuine gentleman try to keep the front of the house
last thing that be sort_of a negative to -PRON- be that when i hear of a mom\/pop spot with korean food i think traditional comfort_food
maybe some jajangmyeon galbi jjim or something other_than the standard fair like kalbi bulgogi and bibimbap offering
-PRON- would not make a special trip but if -PRON- in the area and want a good lunch at a good price and time be not an_issue
stop on by as -PRON- be sure -PRON- will be pleased like so_many other
-PRON- can_not beat the happy_hour at brio
the appetizer be seriously yummy and $ 2.95 each work for -PRON-
-PRON- meet a friend this evening -PRON- sit_at the bar and have a fabulous time
-PRON- order the spicy shrimp\/egglant yum margharita flatbread light and good and the meatballs w\/ polenta great but slightly salty with two iced_tea and a gin\/tonic -PRON- bill be $ 21.00

thank -PRON- matt and granit dude who makeup -PRON- team

by_far the good breakfast and big surprise in the trade area
the flavor profile the plate presentation etc make -PRON- worth the trip
do_not let the fact_that -PRON- be part gas_station part car_wash part convenience store that just add to the atmosphere
rat as one of america 's must have meal for a reason
the long_line which exist so long as this_place be open for business be well_worth the wait
-PRON- can_not go_wrong when order here so have no fear
go to hewat 's while visit edinburgh on a tip from -PRON- b&b. arrive 20_minute after -PRON- open on a wednesday night so -PRON- be the first table of the evening and be promise that -PRON- would get the host 's undivided attention

-PRON- order the mushroom soup and roast pork while jeremy go for the smoke fish cake and salmon\/prawn dish with crab and pea risotto
all of the meal be tasty although the fish cake be by_far -PRON- favorite

desserts be the highlight of the meal
the sticky toffee pudding be rich and sumptuous to the point that -PRON- be struggle to finish -PRON- although -PRON- desperately want to
the lemon tart have a nice crisp bruleed top and have the perfect_balance of tart and sweet
-PRON- also have multiple scotch choice at price that amaze these two americans so -PRON- think if -PRON- live in the area -PRON- would come_here for drink and dessert more_than the dinner
despite the tasty food -PRON- be disappoint by the service
-PRON- be tell that since -PRON- be one of only three occupied table that -PRON- could expect lot_of attention but the whole_experience take about two hour
food come_out hot so perhaps -PRON- be the time -PRON- take to prepare -PRON- but no one check on -PRON- while -PRON- be eat
-PRON- also take about_10_minute to get the bill after -PRON- request -PRON- and another 10 for -PRON- to take -PRON- to the register

even_though -PRON- tour fail to happen the hoover dam leave -PRON- proud of what americans have accomplish
the amount_of concrete be shocking and the sheer force of the water below -PRON- will leave -PRON- awestruck at how something like this could come to be

this be a great experience
do -PRON- and -PRON- kid a favor and come see this

the beer_selection be pretty_good some local but make_sure to ask what else -PRON- have
multiple beer be not list on the menu
the only_reason for 4_star be because the door be open to the patio where multiple people be smoke both cigarette and cigar the smoke be flow into the building
gross

-PRON- also love how committed -PRON- be to the theme and that -PRON- menu be very specialized rather_than cluttered
review as follow ~ service
5\/5
everyone be super_friendly and helpful
-PRON- initially think -PRON- take a little while to get -PRON- food but -PRON- be definitely not the kind_of sandwich -PRON- get subway or capriotti 's
-PRON- be a meal and -PRON- pay_attention to every order
pricing
4.5\/5
$_9 for a sandwich be a little_steep but the portion be huge and -PRON- come with fry or potato_salad
-PRON- would probably be more reasonable to skim a dollar off the price of the sandwich and then opt in for a meal but oh whale food skinny dip
4.5\/5
-PRON- boyfriend love this sandwich and -PRON- look amazing
this not so skinny sandwich be load up with melt gooey cheese
-PRON- say -PRON- be one of the good french_onion dip sandwich -PRON- be ever have and -PRON- will_definitely be back
meat hater
2\/5 -PRON- on the other_hand will probably not be come_back
-PRON- be really excited and surprised when -PRON- see that one of -PRON- 7 signature sub be vegetarian and absolutely_love the name lol
the sandwich -PRON- be very bland however
-PRON- be load up with roasted veggie and mozzarella top with lettuce and tomato toss in a very light dressing
if -PRON- do_not_know any better -PRON- would say the sandwich be healthy gasp and admittedly not what -PRON- want in a sandwich
there be a lack of flavor and texture and -PRON- get a quarter of the way_through -PRON- sandwich before -PRON- get really bored with -PRON- and -PRON- be just force -PRON- to finish the entire half and -PRON- could_not
the sandwich be not inedible -PRON- be just boring and tasteless
a for effort but load that shit up with some flavor
fry 3\/5
potato_salad 4\/5
overall 4\/5 -PRON- know -PRON- be hat on the meat hater but -PRON- do really think this_place be good as long as -PRON- do_not get -PRON-
great service reasonably_price for huge portion and good food for meat eater
as for vegetarian
try somewhere_else
-PRON- make_reservation here for -PRON- friend birthday
as_soon_as -PRON- get there -PRON- be seat_immediately though the hostess be not too friendly
-PRON- order drink and an the spinach and artichoke appetizer to share which come_out very quickly
all of the food be very good
the portion be large and everyone have food to take home
since -PRON- be celebrate a birthday -PRON- have to order dessert

-PRON- recommend this to anyone ever
oh -PRON- goodness can_not wait to get back to chop.
-PRON- go with 5 other people and decide to share everything to get a good feel for the menu
for app -PRON- have the artichoke which be out of this_world
just the right texture and smokey flavor
-PRON- also have the salmon app and fry both be soo good
the sauce with everything be beyond great too
for meal -PRON- have collectively salmon with pesto
love this dish the salmon be not overwhelmed but compliment by the sauce
filet ummm amazing
cooked to perfection with a delicious butter on_top
ribs
really good tender
the sauce do have a kick which be ok by -PRON-

-PRON- feel_like -PRON- do_not see trout on the menu in az very often be from the midwest
-PRON- be a little skeptical but -PRON- be delicious seasoned and cook perfect and the portion be enormous
overall -PRON- love the atmosphere the waitstaff be so friendly and the food be awesome
this be a great date_night spot or would be a great girl night out
-PRON- can_not wait to get back
update i have change -PRON- review to 5_star
-PRON- comment below still apply but the pizza have just be so good lately -PRON- have to earn 5_star
-PRON- pizza be usually pretty_good
-PRON- have decent dough if -PRON- like a slightly thick crust
sauce be great and topping be fresh not can and plentiful
the only problem be when -PRON- call to place -PRON- order
-PRON- will be put on hold
and -PRON- mean -PRON- will always be put on hold
try -PRON-
-PRON- have order maybe 20 + time and 20\/20 -PRON- thank -PRON- for call please hold
-PRON- be so routine that -PRON- be comical
when -PRON- go into the store -PRON- will see about a dozen or so kid just meander about fold box talk whatev
if the phone ring -PRON- will walk over answer put on hold then go_back to -PRON- work or_whatev
-PRON- be absolutely hilarious-
but sometimes -PRON- be rather annoying barros-
please stop make pph put people on hold part of -PRON- training process
-PRON- be okay to just answer the phone and take the order
surely -PRON- can train all -PRON- employee to accomplish this task
-PRON- will receive 5_star if -PRON- can fix this
this tour be amazing
-PRON- teach -PRON- how to ride in under a hour and justin and the team be so helpful and friendly
-PRON- would_recommend this experience for anyone_who want to see vegas in a new light
decide to chance -PRON- on mother_'s day
get there around 9 be mildly surprised -PRON- get a table right_away
good timing too about 20_minute_later the place be pack
-PRON- be serve pleasantly and efficiently
have a throwback look to -PRON- -PRON- really be a diner
sure everything be vegetarian but -PRON- food should appeal to veggie vegan and everyone
unless -PRON- know -PRON- do_not like food
-PRON- -PRON- be stuck
-PRON- have the early birdito with tofu with oj -PRON- wife have the what the waff
with the potato -PRON- mother in law try the frank lloyd bite with the fruit salad and -PRON- old_daughter have the avocado sando with chip
everyone enjoy everything
-PRON- think the 5-star dish here be the waffle
as much as -PRON- like -PRON- breakfast_burrito next_time -PRON- will be try those or the goat_cheese pancake which no one try on this trip
-PRON- daughter scarf down the sandwich and then steal some of -PRON- rosemary potato
the frank lloyd bite be really more of a sampler platter
if -PRON- order that -PRON- hope -PRON- be really hungry
all in all a successful trip
the previous description of -PRON- as low_key be on the money
really like the feel of the place
rent through southwest vacations for a quick weekend getaway to scottsdale
the actual check in process be not very bad
came right up to the counter and be help right_away
be not pressure to upgrade anything but be talk into pre purchase gas at a cheap price than in_town
the gentleman explain that the $ 28 charge be an_estimate and -PRON- will be credit with the return of the kia rio -PRON- have rent
should have prob read the yelp_review first
-PRON- be hop for the good when -PRON- return the car in 2 day
do_not like that when -PRON- say the boyfriend would also be drive -PRON- charge an_extra $ 10\/per day
but once -PRON- notice this -PRON- have -PRON- take both the driver and the charge off
no_problem
-PRON- think this should have be make aware to -PRON- right_away
big problem be go to actually get the car
-PRON- leave the check in area and go downstairs into the garage
no biggee
upon come up to the payless counter the counter girl -PRON- believe -PRON- name be geraldine be sit with a boy from one of the other company with ear bud in -PRON- ear and -PRON- take -PRON- a minute to even acknowledge -PRON-
no hello good evening or anything
rude
-PRON- give -PRON- out key and tell -PRON- which space
-PRON- be to go to the car and check for damage
when -PRON- come_back to tell -PRON- about the damage include what look_like the bumper have be side swipe -PRON- once_again have the ear bud in and look horribly irritated when -PRON- arrive
-PRON- rip out the ear bud and that be -PRON- irritate -PRON-
-PRON- ask be -PRON- put -PRON- out or something
-PRON- do_not say anything
-PRON- be in the customer_service business act_like -PRON-
when -PRON- report the damage -PRON- circle all the area of the car and say -PRON- will all be fine
then when -PRON- mention that the one side actually look_like -PRON- be side swipe another employee pip in and say -PRON- be from the luggage
-PRON- will not be charge for that
ugh no -PRON- be not
but -PRON- be not about to get into a piss match
-PRON- be hop the return experience will be good and the employee who help -PRON- next_time will actually care_about -PRON- job and not music on -PRON- phone
update
car be return with no_problem and no refund for 1\/2 tank of gas
gentleman say if -PRON- want -PRON- can go to a gas_station and fill -PRON- up
boooo
felt like -PRON- be take
note to self
make_sure to read yelp_review
this_place be suggest by a trust friend
i be not disappoint in taste quantity quality however -PRON- do think -PRON- be a little_pricey
-PRON- will be back for sure but will spend a little less cash
dude
the crust
-PRON- be so different but very very yummy
-PRON- make -PRON- 1\/2 casanova very enjoyable
-PRON- would be draw to that style of pizza on -PRON- crust more_than the traditional saucy pepperoni stuff
-PRON- seem more fitting to -PRON-
-PRON- hubby have the pepperoni and something just wast quite right
-PRON- be not bad at all
the salad and appetizer selection be like dream worthy
so unique
-PRON- will be back for those for sure
-PRON- sit_at the bar and the bartender be fine
not rude no_problem but not nice disengage with people maybe
huh -PRON- do_not_know
maybe -PRON- be needy
haha
-PRON- stylist be super_nice
do_not like -PRON- color the first_time
so -PRON- contact -PRON- to come in
and -PRON- would re do -PRON-
love the color and the salon
-PRON- have great customer_service and a nice salon
fish_taco be mediocre and have bbq_sauce
most disappointing taco place -PRON- have ever be to especially_since everybody have nothing but wonderful thing to say
-PRON- do_not_know_what the review be like for bakersfield but the taco be 10x good along_with the atmosphere and crowd
sorry buddy
-PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- have watch all -PRON- show and feel_like -PRON- know -PRON- and -PRON- family
but customer_service at -PRON- bakery in_las_vegas be the bad
-PRON- wait patiently to get -PRON- treat
-PRON- kid have -PRON- cupcake and cookie
-PRON- ask for the eclair which all be delicious
-PRON- husband order -PRON- famous cannoli and when -PRON- open -PRON- order the cannoli be miss
when -PRON- go_back the girl who ring -PRON- do_not believe -PRON-
-PRON- show -PRON- the order minus the cookie and cupcak -PRON- kid have already eat
-PRON- be treat like criminal
after so_much back and forth and show -PRON- receipt and many dirty look -PRON- get the cannolis
the most bitter cannoli -PRON- have eat in -PRON- life
not go_back to the vegas location
nice club pop bottle be a must especially if -PRON- be a group_of dude
and if -PRON- do tip the man and get a table inside
need more bathroom because the area in front be not move people be go to get trample one day
not much else to say
-PRON- really_enjoy this_place
-PRON- walk_in just want to browse and 30_minute later -PRON- leave with a bottle_of oil and vinegar
the store keeper be very_knowledgeable and spend lot_of time with explain the subtle difference among -PRON- product and allow -PRON- to taste around 7 or 8 different oil and vinegar
-PRON- be a great experience
-PRON- will_definitely be back once -PRON- need more
this_place be a joke people here be so slow
pay_$ 17 for one slice of avocado on toast and coffee and wait over 15_min
-PRON- be not even busy
no line
everyone be just stand around talk and -PRON- order be sit around
the guy take order with tattoo on -PRON- arm be just chat everyone and do_not even look and follow_up on what be happen
do_not recommend
now that -PRON- find out -PRON- can_not eat wheat -PRON- learn there be only one thing on the menu that be gluten_free
because of what this restaurant stand for -PRON- would expect a little more
everything_else be great though
great food decently_price and generous_portion
however -PRON- do_not recommend order for pickup or delivery
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have order here religiously because -PRON- love the food but the experience have be less_than favorable
delivery take over_an_hour which would be fine if the order be deliver as order
-PRON- seem every other order have be incorrect or cold
the last order -PRON- place come 72 minute after be place be cold and -PRON- have forget -PRON- beverage
-PRON- call to inquire and check on the possibility of the beverage be deliver and the response -PRON- have get be that -PRON- would not be deliver
-PRON- money would not be refund
-PRON- offer to give -PRON- free beverage on -PRON- next delivery but -PRON- will_never order again
there have be too_many mistake and inconsistency with delivery so -PRON- would only recommend this_location for a dine_in experience
review come soon

-PRON- go to this_place from the opposite side of town because a good friend recommend -PRON- to -PRON-
the rib be a little burn and dry
the pork be good but nothing extraordinary
-PRON- may have be just a bad cooking day but -PRON- be hard to justify the drive all the way there just to give -PRON- another_chance
pie square be the result of somebody have far too_much money and far too little knowledge of marketing and branding
have a theme be one thing but these_guy take -PRON- way_too far and not in a good way
-PRON- absolutely_love pie
but -PRON- could_not even begin to like this_place as hard as -PRON- try
pie square
the people_who work there wear lab coat get -PRON-
the menu be a periodic table of element that be so intent on stick to the theme of be a periodic table that -PRON- be nearly impossible to actually read -PRON- to place an order
the pie be square shape get -PRON-
-PRON- ask for a business card and guess_what shape the card be in
yeah a square
the idea be good but the execution be terrible
-PRON- be in a dead space on bloor street that hardly anybody walk by
the pie be dry and extremely small for the price -PRON- pay
-PRON- also sit under heat lamp for who know_how long while place an order be far too reminiscent of try to solve a high_school math problem
if pie be what -PRON- sell focus_on make the good pie possible and leave the gimmick to someone_else
always love -PRON- burger
-PRON- always get the plain jane and sweet_potato_fry

good_luck to all -PRON- venture to this_place
go here look for piece for a costume -PRON- be work on
the staff be very_nice and the store be clean and well organize
the price seem a_bit high as -PRON- have be to a number_of army surplus store lately look for various outfit piece
say -PRON- deliver until 2_a.m.
call at 12:30am and -PRON- be a_bit rude about tell -PRON- -PRON- have already stop delivery
maybe high_expectation on -PRON- part but if -PRON- advertise certain hour -PRON- should be honor still hungry
gross gross gross
stinks and food suck
would not go_back if food be free
-PRON- do_not_know_how -PRON- stay open
make -PRON- gag
do the buffet of buffet
24_hour buffet pass for 5 different hotel
by_far the good buffet be le village at the paris hotel
just come for the dessert
probably the good flan -PRON- family have ever taste and -PRON- like flan so rich and melt_in -PRON- mouth smooth and creamy
but the macaroon and creme_brûlée be definitely a very close second
the prime_rib stuff lamb and crab_leg be excellent good_than the other
the setting be also fun and unique
breakfast be also worth -PRON-
amazing scramble_egg and delicious carve back bacon as_well_as ham and sausage
crepe make to order
if -PRON- be do buffet of buffet again this would be breakfast lunch and dinner
-PRON- mom want to go out for mexican_food for -PRON- birthday and after a long search for somewhere that be birthday nice -PRON- find la catrina in brampton
this be the best dining_experience -PRON- have ever have with -PRON- family

-PRON- try -PRON- and -PRON- be wonderful
the pull_pork be moist and flavourful and the cactus salad -PRON- substitute -PRON- for -PRON- rice be really refreshing
the food -PRON- be not spicy but the three sauce -PRON- bring to -PRON- table be amazing and the perfect_amount of spicy
-PRON- finish -PRON- off
a server that be not even assign -PRON- table bring -PRON- more when -PRON- run out
and when -PRON- ask for box for -PRON- leftover -PRON- server bring little container so -PRON- mom could take the leftover sauce home too
-PRON- tell -PRON- server that -PRON- be celebrate -PRON- mom_'s birthday and how_much -PRON- love the sauce and the little container -PRON- bring_out just make -PRON- mom_'s day
-PRON- tell -PRON- the food be amazing and -PRON- have a wonderful time and would definitely be back
-PRON- say -PRON- would let the chef know
then the chef come_out to chat with -PRON-
-PRON- be a very_nice man and a talented chef
-PRON- be also very humble say that -PRON- be -PRON- grandmother 's recipe
and honestly -PRON- have never have food like -PRON-
so -PRON- know that be a family that know good food and take_pride_in do -PRON- right
-PRON- be all too stuff to try any of the dessert
but before -PRON- could pay for the bill -PRON- server and a third server come_out with a piece_of the tre lech cake with a candle in -PRON- for -PRON- mom
-PRON- be thrilled and the cake be incredibly moist and just the right_amount_of sweetness
-PRON- even play -PRON- traditional birthday song over -PRON- sound_system for -PRON- mom which be absolutely lovely of -PRON-
if -PRON- want generic bland food with no personality that be prepare with no passion do_not go to la catrina go to a chain and enjoy the mundane
if -PRON- want to go_somewhere to make some memory while eat delicious food in a friendly environment then go to la catrina
this be the kind_of place that deserve to make -PRON- big and the staff be the kind_of people_who know_how to treat -PRON- customer like -PRON- matter
needless_to_say -PRON- plan on return and will keep on spread the word
if anyone from la catrina read this thank again for make -PRON- mom_'s birthday so wonderful for -PRON-
-PRON- wish -PRON- restaurant all the success
the service ask for matt be tremendous
perhaps the good experience -PRON- have have with a server in_phoenix
price be not cheap but the quality be terrific both in drink and food
-PRON- recommend the mojito and the pernil taco
-PRON- be glad this_place be walk distance
only quibble the techno beat fit the decor but -PRON- be not into -PRON-
super delicious
the banh mi have all the punch string flavor all contain in a think crisp soft bun
the meat be soft and amazingly tender
this will be a regular stop for -PRON-
update
go for -PRON- weekly sushi trip and -PRON- have to say that the last_visit must have be a fluke
service be amazing food be excellent and sashimi taste_like -PRON- be live in hawaii again
-PRON- love_this_place and be so happy -PRON- live so close
wonderful delicious fresh food
at first the menu seem_like nothing_special what -PRON- would expect on an applebee menu except the food be awesome
let -PRON- tell -PRON- about the good steak -PRON- have ever have
aged beef sear to perfection and -PRON- just melt everywhere in -PRON- mouth
no chew necessary
find here
anyways -PRON- highly_suggest this_place if -PRON- in the area
-PRON- be a great addition to the nugget and fremont st.
pretty_good food and service overall
-PRON- get the crab spinach dip for an_appetizer and be not disappoint need more chip and have the fresh artic char blacken with mash_potato and mixed veggie
never have artic char but -PRON- be pretty similar to salmon but a little milder
price be high
but -PRON- be pretty upscale and
a lot_of quality go into the food
never have a bad_experience in this restaurant
-PRON- personal_favorite be red_curry fried rice
a great place to try something new and be sure that -PRON- will taste amazing
have viatnamese crepe and thai noodle_soup
and -PRON- be fantastic
be prepare to wait though
-PRON- do_not_accept cash at night and the employee be really rude
would probably never go there again
love the bbq duck as -PRON- pretty juicy and not dry
would come again during_lunch which -PRON- have the roasted duck and roast pork
price be pretty reasonable too
this_place be awesome
-PRON- dog love -PRON- and -PRON- get great customer_service every_time -PRON- come in
-PRON- dog hat when -PRON- give -PRON- bath so -PRON- can_imagine how difficult -PRON- be
but when -PRON- get -PRON- after the grooming -PRON- be so happy
-PRON- can tell -PRON- really love dog here
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- go to charr for restaurant week
-PRON- be a little early for -PRON- reservation so -PRON- sit_at the bar
the bartender be really nice and lively
-PRON- order a cocktail off -PRON- menu and -PRON- be pretty_good
when -PRON- sit_down for -PRON- meal -PRON- take some time for -PRON- server to get to -PRON-
-PRON- come to -PRON- and ask if -PRON- have be help since -PRON- already have drink
-PRON- guess the hostess do_not inform -PRON-
-PRON- order crab_cake for -PRON- appetizer the portabella burger with truffle_fry for -PRON- and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend and bread_pudding with bourbon blueberry for dinner
this be the reason -PRON- be give this_place 3_star service be really slow
another couple sit next to -PRON- after -PRON- be seat and -PRON- get -PRON- food before -PRON-
-PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- be because of the steak -PRON- order but -PRON- be a long_time until -PRON- get -PRON- main_course
the actual food taste good but nothing to die for really
also -PRON- tap water taste a_bit off
maybe -PRON- be not filter
eek
just like this rating -PRON- experience at charr be a ok
-PRON- really like chipotle
-PRON- be far_superior to moe and qdoba
-PRON- highly_recommend a burrito with rice black_bean fajita mix pico hot_sauce sour_cream and cheese
always fast and hot food
3.5_star happy_hour be awesome
great deal and -PRON- margarita be load with alcohol
the taco be small but pretty_good -PRON- recommend the chicken one on happy_hour
great atmosphere great service but would like to see cheap price for say the quesadilla and more taco for the money -PRON- think not on happy_hour two small taco be like $_6 and the quesadilla be always about $_9 and -PRON- be huge do_not make_sense
a group_of close friend choose the elm tree base_on the yelp_review
this be a quick dinner before go to a nearby show and -PRON- all agree that on the next_visit -PRON- would be spend more time to do -PRON- justice
the service be simply top_notch from entry to quick exit
the dish be uniformly spectacular with honorable mention to the duck risotto
-PRON- do_not have time to order wine but the list be more_than adequate with a_few that -PRON- dearly would have love to try
as -PRON- be there be a selection of craft_beer that hit the right note
the ambiance be sophisticated without be overwhelming
perfect for a date_night but comfortable enough for a group
-PRON- will absolutely be back to try -PRON- under a less pressing schedule but good to know -PRON- can accommodate that also
if -PRON- have a family donot move here
new dictate management be enforce a policy that do_not allow child to be outside without a supervisor 18yr or old at all time
the child here which be several have not do anything to because this to -PRON- knowledge
-PRON- guess brepropertie want to take a new direction with these apartment
old staff be great but look_like a restructure to -PRON-
make -PRON- wonder_what s next
get the cookie monster here
the ice_cream portion be huge
the flavor be creamy and not too_sweet
definitely must_try
presentation of the ice_cream be great
-PRON- be instagram worthy
first_time do_not_know_what to expect
all i know be -PRON- be crave sushi
walk_in and love the design of the place
have a chipotle vibe to -PRON- but for sushi and bowl of_course
service be awkward since -PRON- be teen work behind the counter and -PRON- lack charisma and communication
now to the food sushi be decent
the seaweed however be very chewy and take -PRON- awhile to swallow
again teen make -PRON- sushi maybe -PRON- be new but definitely will try this_place out again
not really custard
good ice_cream
not rita 's or frostbites
-PRON- do_not see -PRON- visit vegas again but if -PRON- do -PRON- will most assuredly go here
mon ami gabi have an ambiance that must be feel rather_than see
what other casino try to emulate gabi deliver a next good thing parisian experience rather_than eat expensive shitty pasta at the palaccio or god know_what at new_york new_york
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be moderately dress up no tie or heel and do_not feel out of place or unwelcome for a moment
the lighting be very flattering and cozy feeling and -PRON- server who be the human embodiment of espresso or perhaps cocaine make -PRON- feel very welcome and comfortable
meal start with free baguette which do_not stun but_hey there be a gorgeous and well curat wine cart
cut
whatev carb relate loss -PRON- have and order the french_onion_soup divine and make with cognac
-PRON- have the mussel and the fry which be both truly scrumptious
other friend order the scallop four out of five wild_boar pasta five out of five and a sirloin six out of five that even -PRON- pescetarian self have to have a bite out of
-PRON- know -PRON- way around a cut of beef here select prime cow only a bone in cut with a perfect outside char\/sear and blood red middle
-PRON-
be
amaze
do_not sit on the patio or -PRON- be miss the ambiance
do hit up that wine cart more_than once
while -PRON- do order the banana foster crepe -PRON- be not_sure -PRON- would order -PRON- again
-PRON- would probably try the escargot or order oyster
bon appetite
or some other cliché
free_wifi lot_of shopping convenient 28x airport flyer into town and generally not too_many delay this of_course do_not include weather relate delay which -PRON- can_not really blame on the airport
con
not many flight in\/out of this airport
there be very few nonstop flight available and airfare be consistently high for this airport
airport be pretty outdated looking
not a big_deal functionally but not so exciting to look_at
security line be always so long
-PRON- fly a lot for work so -PRON- be base this on fly into many different airport about 2 4 time a month
also traffic from the airport into the city since there be basically only one way in
the entire crew at grouchy john 's be amazing
-PRON- make -PRON- feel so welcome and appreciate
the service be top_notch
the decor inside be awesome
-PRON- drink be so original and delicious
-PRON- have everything -PRON- can think of
-PRON- highly_recommend this_place to everyone
this_place be poppin at 1 p.m. on a saturday
seating be jampack
fish_taco -PRON- find -PRON- odd that -PRON- plat the 2 taco on two separate plate
poor server have to juggle more plate
no side
but -PRON- be ok since -PRON- just get 2 taco pile high with grill fish slaw and mango
deliciousness increase two fold with the slathering on of the tiger sauce -PRON- have available for use by the shoyu
spicy ahi poke pair with incredible taro chip
this be a great app to start_off the meal
grilled fish plate
hubby 's entree
-PRON- seem to enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- be very random to have a slice of tomato with shredded cheese on_top haha
coconuts be definitely a solid lunch spot
-PRON- would not say -PRON- be anything too unique or earth shattering but everything be well do and enjoyable
let -PRON- clarify that -PRON- previous review be in regard to purchase a car and this one be about service
-PRON- end_up purchase a hyundai accent elsewhere
but now -PRON- wheel bearing or something really -PRON- be a girl -PRON- do_not_know this crap
be make way_too_much noise when -PRON- drive
so -PRON- bring -PRON- in
not only be -PRON- burst with happiness that -PRON- be cover under warranty
but -PRON- have the most delicious hot_chocolate here that -PRON- will shamefully admit to drink six cup still wait so -PRON- may be more in -PRON- future while -PRON- have be wait plus -PRON- have a great wifi signal so -PRON- can stay on_top_of work
bonus
everyone have be prompt friendly and helpful
edit
-PRON- love_this_place
-PRON- come in for -PRON- right wheel bearing and -PRON- end_up replace the right and leave
-PRON- also say -PRON- need another repair
and -PRON- go_ahead and order the part
so -PRON- get -PRON- do before -PRON- be past 60,000 on -PRON- warranty which will happen in the next few_week
yay
-PRON- have be to stone peppers on a number_of occasion and overall the food an service have be good in the restaurant
-PRON- have a large_selection of pizza sandwich and salad that all have fresh quality ingredient and -PRON- be a relaxed_atmosphere
-PRON- review would be good overall but the bar have never be a good experience for -PRON-
on one occasion -PRON- go with a friend during a penguins playoff game
-PRON- be crowd but not excessively so
since no table at the bar be available and all the stool be take -PRON- stand near the bar and wait
-PRON- be next to impossible to get any of the bartender to respond to order drink
-PRON- run into some other friend_who be sit_at the bar and have request more beer and have be wait for 20_minute for -PRON- drink
-PRON- have another similar experience when the bar be not crowd the bartender just seem to not be interested_in serve customer
in both case -PRON- seem_like -PRON- be more interested_in talk to -PRON- friend or flirt with regular
-PRON- will go_back for the restaurant but never again for the bar
jesus christ
this_place
-PRON- be not religious but if -PRON- serve these sandwich at a church -PRON- would ask to be baptise
-PRON- already come_here at_least_once a week
the sandwich -PRON- favourite sandwich be the turkey and the smoke chicken
the fry tomato completely vegetarian be amazing too
these be not mere sandwich
-PRON- can easily fuel -PRON- for five six hour
especially the turkey
the fry
-PRON- do_not_know_how the chef make -PRON- fry but damn the crispy salty potato skin on -PRON- be to die for
the soup -PRON- be not a huge_fan_of soup in_general but -PRON- be a_bit under the weather the other day and -PRON- have a bowl of the leek and potato soup and that stuff get -PRON- roll again so there be that
as good as everything_else which be to say pretty damn good
do_not just try this_place
make -PRON- part of -PRON- routine
when -PRON- fly to vegas to buy a use chevy ssr -PRON- see advertise -PRON- be not expect good service base_on a_few yelp_review
turn_out the customer_service be very good
the dealership be attractive -PRON- immediately notice 2 huge poster on the wall in the showroom proclaim -PRON- vow to treat customer with the utmost respect
-PRON- be impressed
the internet sale rep lee bueno be inform professional very_friendly
like -PRON- say -PRON- be very knowledgable about the car the sale process
-PRON- negotiate a fair_price with lee never feel pressured or uncomfortable
the finance manager kevin aviles be also friendly professional
the process with -PRON- be efficient relatively quick
although -PRON- be at the dealership for about 3 hour include the test_drive inspection -PRON- do_not seem long or tedious
-PRON- be probably not fair to withhold a star base_on -PRON- coffee which be not good -PRON- be go to do that
-PRON- be a beautiful dealership worthy of a kuerig or other fresh coffee
if -PRON- coffee be good -PRON- be an easy 5_star
-PRON- would do business with this dealership anytime trust lee to be fair
ps after -PRON- drive home to san_diego -PRON- husband realize -PRON- have only receive 1 key
-PRON- call lee lee call the previous owner 3 day -PRON- have the 2nd key
that be great service
for the price i pay and the quality of the food -PRON- be a great deal
-PRON- have more then a buffet
-PRON- have a feast
service be good and the food be decent for the price
-PRON- can_not complain
the ice_cream the sake the sushi the tempura
all very good in -PRON- opinion
def
worth stop in when -PRON- be in_vegas
lot_of parking casual atire and prettty much just bring -PRON- apetite with -PRON- to make -PRON- worth -PRON-
in the day and age of suburban strip_mall day spa vegas be perhaps the leader of -PRON- all
if the first industry in_vegas be gaming and tourism then the beauty spa industry have get to be a close second
have say all of that one could go to just about any strip_mall for a full service day of beauty in_las_vegas
but what set pamper me spa salon apart from all the rest be that -PRON- price can_not be beat
-PRON- have have the pleasure of get -PRON- mani\/pedi hair and brow do here sometimes on the very same_day
these service make -PRON- a regular these root do_not stay brown on -PRON- own ya_know
-PRON- offer bottled water while -PRON- get whatev service -PRON- need do
in this blaze heat bottled water be a welcome treat
the spa be bright and colorful peter the owner be very warm and welcome and know -PRON- name after -PRON- second_visit
the full service spa include massage body wrap salt glow scrub and facial and -PRON- intend to try some of these if not all of these thing out very soon
-PRON- even offer two type_of reasonably_price internal cleansing system for those_who wish to beautify within ionic detoxification and colon hydrotherapy
the price be so right -PRON- may just have to do some internal housekeeping and beautification
mani\/pedis start at $ 37 -PRON- do great gel nail both liquid and powder gel be $ 55 and powder be $ 45 silk wrap plus acrlyic pink and white be $ 45
for those of -PRON- live in the northwest -PRON- highly_suggest -PRON- give -PRON- a try
pamper me spa salon be locate on north rancho and craig in the smith 's shopping_center
after -PRON- day of beauty -PRON- suggest -PRON- go across the street to the draft house for a tall cool one -PRON- choice of spirit and an_appetizer while the patron marvel at -PRON- polished fabulousity
enjoy
-PRON- brother and -PRON- each have the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and split the cinnamon french_toast
the croissant be flakey buttery and absolutely_delicious
-PRON- both love the cinnamon french_toast which be serve with a small cup of whip_cream and thinly slice strawberry
there be also a small cup of syrup
but -PRON- could_not tell if -PRON- be maple or some other flavor as -PRON- use very little of -PRON-
the cinnamon bread be thickly slice and have a nice balance between sweetness and the cinnamon
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal so_much two day_later -PRON- go_back for a bowl of tomato bisque soup
-PRON- really_enjoy the soup and can_not wait to go_back and try -PRON- other flavor
like another_reviewer -PRON- be also confuse by the bad review
-PRON- do have combination now
and -PRON- do_not consider -PRON- pricing to be out of line
-PRON- find the staff to be friendly and helpful and do_not have long to wait for -PRON- order
walk_in and everyone be very_friendly -PRON- be seat fast and -PRON- never have an empty drink or run out of chip food be great and the beer be cold and crisp
anyone want good mexican_food -PRON- highly_recommend -PRON- will not be disappoint

-PRON- can_not beat the view
-PRON- have a super impressive experience at this panera yesterday
-PRON- order the mac_n_cheese
-PRON- be so creamy and delicious
towards the bottom of -PRON- bowl there be a small piece_of plastic
sort_of like the kind -PRON- would find on a freezer bag
-PRON- hand to the manager walk by
-PRON- do_not say much when -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON-

unlike -PRON- husband -PRON- find -PRON- to be completely glorious
eye candy at -PRON- fine whether -PRON- be a fan_of costume theater in_general or the disney version_of hamlet
go into the show know the film inside and out -PRON- genuinely wonder how -PRON- be go to stage certain part of the film -PRON- just seem_like -PRON- would be too difficult
but alas -PRON- be pleasantly_surprised at all of -PRON- especially the epic wildebe stampede scene
simply marvelous
-PRON- be intense and visually stunning which be also a great way to sum up the show in_general
the actor be amazing specifically the woman play rafiki
-PRON- be so awesome and funny
-PRON- really steal the show
same with timon and pumbaa -PRON- really love pumbaa 's costume but think timon could have be do differently
the hyena be also a treat
-PRON- also love how -PRON- throw in little extra like vegas joke
this show do have an intermission but -PRON- do_not find -PRON- to be that bad
-PRON- think the show 's length be perfect
-PRON- really love also how the entire theater be the stage and how when -PRON- be come into the auditorium -PRON- already have the band play -PRON- drum and really set the scene
do -PRON- mention the costume
oh_my god the costume
intricate and beautiful and so modern
-PRON- could_not stop drool -PRON- be gorgeous
-PRON- find this show to be completely delightful and worth_every_penny
music actor costume staging everything be perfection
-PRON- really be a masterpiece and something to be see
-PRON- do live_up to the hype for -PRON- and be a very well do representation of the classic disney film
-PRON- wish more broadway would come to vegas and -PRON- be sad to see this show go as -PRON- know a_few of the cast member and -PRON- be totally sweet and awesome people_who be also bum out about have to leave
mandalay_bay really screw that one up but hopefully something equally awesome will go in -PRON- place
if -PRON- ever get the chance to see this show again -PRON- will_definitely take that opportunity
farewell lion king
-PRON- really want to love_this_place but there be some problem
to start the sangria be water_down and with -PRON- be 20 buck -PRON- be not worth 5 in -PRON- opinion
the snail have a garlicky cheese sauce and be amazing must_try
in an attempt to find a cheese -PRON- have in portugal
-PRON- get -PRON- grill_cheese with the peri peri sauce
-PRON- be not bad worth a try
sardine one of the waitress recommend add balsamic to these
and wow -PRON- be great
the gizzard with a gravy now these be chicken gizzard and have a beef tasting gravy
-PRON- really do_not do -PRON- for -PRON-
beef and chicken two separate flavor that need to be separate
the paella well -PRON- be soupy and tomato base need -PRON- say more
amazing food always awesome customer_service and the restaurant be immaculately clean
the good place in_town for great quality fresh and healthy food
-PRON- have try a lot_of different thing on the menu and -PRON- can_not complain_about a single dish everything be delicious
3.5
while -PRON- be almost a fan -PRON- should have pay good attention to the name of the restaurant when order
have -PRON- be julio 's mexican_food other stuff
-PRON- order would have be a wise choice
but instead -PRON- order a carne_asada quesadilla make by david who specialize_in hamburger
in all fairness to david -PRON- be not bad
-PRON- be not a big quesadilla person but the mexican plate seem to large for -PRON- to consume and expect to walk_around the art festival afterward
and if -PRON- can_not take -PRON- home -PRON- be inclined to stuff -PRON- down
-PRON- do_not_care for the meat in the quesadilla not the seasoning but the actual flavor of the meat -PRON- be odd but -PRON- be perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggie as_well
-PRON- husband 's hamburger however look great and -PRON- be full of envy as -PRON- watch -PRON- finish -PRON- in record time
that envy quickly turn to resentment as -PRON- sample -PRON- quesadilla and remark yep -PRON- be good
-PRON- would pay for -PRON- insensitivity later that afternoon
-PRON- like that -PRON- will add flavoring to -PRON- soft drink but -PRON- cherry coke need more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice
-PRON- do love that this restaurant have not be redesign to fit into the trend of turn old_town into north scottsdale from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booth on the other
-PRON- just think -PRON- will still with burger and shake
well who be -PRON- kid
-PRON- will order david_'s mexican_food again
-PRON- can_not turn down anything in a tortilla
always carry -PRON- dog in and out of the wash and dry table
never let -PRON- jump
-PRON- be slippery and dog have be injure
-PRON- do_not get how in the world this_place do_not have step
other_than_that major safety precaution the employee r helpful and give excellent service
excellent food perfect service
-PRON- have a party of 6 and order the foie_gra escargot and cheese plate as -PRON- appetizer
all be really great but the foie_gra steal the show
for -PRON- entree -PRON- have the lamb filet trout and veal
everyone really_enjoy -PRON- meal
-PRON- personally have the filet which be prime beef by the way only a_few restaurant in_charlotte even offer prime
and -PRON- be like velvet
for desert -PRON- have the crème
brulee
and -PRON- be about the good
-PRON- have ever have
the table also order the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake and both go over very well
this restaurant for -PRON- be among the top 3 in_charlotte
-PRON- can_not wait to go_back
the price be reasonable the mood be unpretentious the service be top_notch and the food be just excellent
the only_reason -PRON- even earn the 1_star be because one of the employee provide a high chair to -PRON- girlfriend during one of -PRON- rare appearance -PRON- make to tend_to -PRON- table
-PRON- have a family gathering here for -PRON- nephew 10th birthday
-PRON- 80 year_old grandmother who be only attend for the joy of celebrate with -PRON- family be not allow in without pay for a full price buffet even_though -PRON- have no intention of eat
after speak to a manager -PRON- decide to allow -PRON- entry but only after be force to pay a $_2 fee unacceptable
none_of the food be stock
when -PRON- ask where the food be -PRON- get nothing but attitude from the kid work who seem_like -PRON- be bother -PRON- by ask for the food -PRON- pay for
there be 10 different kid of dessert list 7 of which be empty
-PRON- be tell the item have to be make and one hour_later -PRON- make eight cinnamon_roll
there be three_time that amount_of people in -PRON- party alone
the silverware tray and plate be not clean at all
-PRON- do get what -PRON- pay for but for the $_12 that -PRON- be force to pay to celebrate a family_member birthday -PRON- should not have to worry_about hygiene and germ
this_place be literally disgusting unaccommodating and should be ashamed of -PRON- for the way -PRON- treat -PRON- grandmother
yummm pad_thai great food great service relatively cheap for the quality of the food -PRON- be get
-PRON- can get expensive if -PRON- want to try all the thing -PRON- have to offer
good to go in a group to split the cost and not waste food because -PRON- a sizable serving
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give neezie 10 star
-PRON- do -PRON- research and have to wait 2_month for -PRON- appt with -PRON-
and -PRON- be worth_every_penny to have -PRON- brow do by the good
-PRON- be so sweet professional and -PRON- feel 100 confident in -PRON- as_soon_as -PRON- meet and consult about -PRON- brow
-PRON- know -PRON- would be super dark and thick immediately but continue to take_care_of -PRON- as -PRON- instruct -PRON- and now -PRON- be perfectly heal and exactly_what -PRON- want -PRON- to be
-PRON- only problem be that the procedure -PRON- hurt bad
from -PRON- previous friend_who have have -PRON- brow do by other -PRON- feel no pain
so -PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- numbing cream be sufficient enough
-PRON- be very quick tho -PRON- would say only take 30_minute to actually carve in -PRON- brow after consult and preliminary drawing but -PRON- work faster than_most other microblader that take about 2_hour
-PRON- price be very fair $ 400 with a small deposit to book -PRON- appointment
-PRON- be not_sure_why other complain that -PRON- brow do_not last -PRON- assumption be that other be impatient and pick the scabbing
-PRON- just put coconut oil on mine every night and -PRON- heal just as expect
can_not wait for -PRON- touch up
-PRON- use to be all about edge fitness
but have learn at this point that -PRON- accounting team do_not_know_what -PRON- be do
-PRON- have a membership with -PRON- for 3 years+
and have always have problem with -PRON- account
unable to find -PRON- name and be hassle that -PRON- do_not have an account no contact info which be require to sign_up autopayment not come_out when -PRON- should lead up to a similar situation to below
at this point -PRON- be worth the move across the street to snap fitness
two month_ago -PRON- credit_card be steal
on the arrival of -PRON- new card -PRON- make the mistake of forget to update -PRON- gym
fair enough
that be -PRON- responsibility
but -PRON- never receive one phone_call or update that -PRON- account have not be pay for the first or even second month
no biggie
at some point -PRON- would expect a call or at_least a letter of non payment
instead -PRON- get a phone_call from a collection agency
-PRON- have to pay_$ 115 because of two month of no payment
even doctor office be not that ruthless
a simple mistake on -PRON- end
-PRON- responsibility -PRON- get that
but collection that quick
that be just bad customer_service
and -PRON- be send directly to collection with no effort of make the client -PRON- aware of nonpayment
-PRON- membership be $ 19.99 a month
-PRON- only owe $_40
a simple phone_call email or letter for awareness would have handle the situation save -PRON- $ 70 unnecessarily spend dollar and keep a long_term customer
way to take_care_of -PRON- customer edge
great place to drink and have fun
especially with such a great bartender like chuck
the food be great the drink be even good
thank chuck for make -PRON- such a geat night
st -PRON- location be super_cute artsy

beautifully package with great\/simple instruction for warm the entree
chefery will be on -PRON- weekly meal planning
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be open minded and enjoy a raunchy show but this show be stupid and childish
-PRON- make sex joke that be immature and plain stupid
-PRON- walk_out 35_minute into the show and request -PRON- money back as -PRON- could_not believe this be a long run vegas show
if -PRON- be go to see a show trust -PRON- -PRON- may need drug to enjoy this show because -PRON- be not entertaining
offend

just smart enough to know when a show be not enjoyable
the coffee be fine the service be horrific

the store be cute and unique -PRON- love that rustic feel to -PRON- as_well_as the cute_little drawing of the tapiocas on the wall
unfortunately the store be tiny and can_not really seat too_many people
therefore -PRON- would_recommend go with a small group i.e. by -PRON- or with just one other friend
customer_service be good -PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- tea leaf and let -PRON- sniff a couple of -PRON-
this be the first bubble_tea place where -PRON- be 100 confident that -PRON- use real tea
in_addition -PRON- make -PRON- own tapioca from_scratch
in_term_of -PRON- tea -PRON- order the iron goddess milk_tea
the taste of the tea be rich may be because -PRON- just see -PRON- tea leaf
and -PRON- be just a placebo effect
and the milk be not_overly sweeten
all tapiocas taste the same to -PRON- so -PRON- can_not really comment_on -PRON-
-PRON- friend order the royal no.9 milk_tea
-PRON- really be not -PRON- cup of tea
-PRON- do_not quite get the appeal of add milk to fruit flavor tea but since -PRON- be so popular there must be something good about -PRON-
the price of the bbt be on_par with chatime 's goncha 's
who be -PRON- kid good bbt be all expensive

the filling be just perfect

the maple bacon one be so flavorful
-PRON- love the flavor mix of sweet and salty
-PRON- also have the texture mix of fluffy and crispy so all of -PRON- sens be intrigue
finally the plain vanilla with sprinkle be far_from plain
the icing be just drip off the doughnut and would melt_in -PRON- mouth to give -PRON- that drool while smile sensation

-PRON- absolutely_love quality pho and both trip to pho cao have make -PRON- wish -PRON- have go to -PRON- usual spot on the west_side
-PRON- live in old_town so this spot be convenient but not much more_than that
service be always slow and forgetful
-PRON- have visit the old spot by the freeway and now the new spot off of mcdowell and both place be dark dank and dive y
-PRON- can appreciate a good dive_bar and even hole_in the wall type place but this_place seem to miss the mark on both
the pho broth taste_like raman broth
-PRON- be not clear like good slow simmered pho both be suppose to be
pho cao 's broth be brown and the noodle be always clump together in a ball at the bottom of the bowl
the spring_roll be decent but the peanut_sauce be def from a jar
-PRON- overtly sweet and taste more like a peanut_butter paste than sauce
like -PRON- say -PRON- not horrible -PRON- just not a genuine pho restaurant
this be a karaoke joint that service hipster who want to think -PRON- be eat genuine pho
service be slow and food be mediocre
-PRON- doubt -PRON- will return

the line may look long but -PRON- be super quick

the pizza here be pretty_good
-PRON- can order a preconceived pizza or customize -PRON- own
once -PRON- be build -PRON- put in -PRON- oven and ready in about 5_minute
service be fast the food be fast

-PRON- be both equally good
fantastic roomy but friendly coffee house in ben avon
family friendly game out of the way area for read and -PRON- even have senior sewing circle
great coffee and light fare
-PRON- often stop for a coffee and steel cut oats with cranberry and brown sugar or almond
one of the good day starter
-PRON- be a coffee house where -PRON- can have conversation with stranger
really an_awesome spot
burger be small
fry be ok
in n_out burgers be good and half the price
service be ok
be do a scooter drive_by and think that place look cool
stop in
place be a zoo
people be ask -PRON- be this the line
how do -PRON- order
what do -PRON- know
-PRON- first_time there
after about_15_minute yes -PRON- wait one of the not so with -PRON- employee actually take -PRON- order
-PRON- get one of the holiday item think -PRON- be a gingerbread cup cake
no where to sit but stand at a strange little bar like table in the corner
one bit stale and bland
throw the rest in the trash
the good part be -PRON- walk_out the front_door and stand there be a homeless guy ask for money
everyone in the store be so busy be confuse -PRON- would never notice pretty strange for this part of scottsdale
one tip the place be all glass and -PRON- the az heat may want to work on cool the place down a_bit
will not return
-PRON- travel to scottsdale several_time a year for work and -PRON- usually stay_at this hotel
-PRON- be definitely a business friendly hotel
lot_of parking and very close to scottsdale restaurant shopping and nightlife
-PRON- do_not have an actual restaurant on_site -PRON- be more like a kiosk with a limited menu serve only breakfast and dinner\/appetizer
no lunch
although the menu be minimal the food be above_average with very_friendly service
the lobby be really comfortable with different seating option and little cubby hole with personal tv and couch which -PRON- love because -PRON- can eat -PRON- meal and watch the tube -PRON- two favorite thing
the pool area be pretty nice however -PRON- be small
the room be a little dated when compare to the lobby however -PRON- be comfy and have everything -PRON- may need
-PRON- will be back again this spring
the place be pretty small and -PRON- be thankful -PRON- make_reservation
-PRON- enjoy the decor
wait
staff be nice polite and friendly
-PRON- hate how alot of small place like this have -PRON- cram right up beside the next table but at_least staff here try to space people out as best as -PRON- could
now for -PRON- -PRON- be over price for anything other_than a plain burger
so -PRON- both get burger
-PRON- ask to have muchroom add to -PRON- since -PRON- have a choice of swiss cheese and either the waiter be new or that_s a strange request since the waiter act_like -PRON- may be an_issue and -PRON- may not have -PRON-
in -PRON- head -PRON- be think this supos to be a place of meat
what do -PRON- mean -PRON- may not be able_to add mushroom but as an avid mushroom lover -PRON- be not strange to -PRON-
after check with the chef -PRON- say -PRON- be not a problem be charge 2bucks for -PRON-
-PRON- burger and fry be cook_perfectly even_though -PRON- ask for ranch on the side and be tell -PRON- do_not have it(what
also -PRON- burger meat seem much smallert than the bun
the food be enjoyable -PRON- be a comfortable relaxed setting
however -PRON- do believe for -PRON- this be just a one time try
note
-PRON- review be base_on the gladstone as a venue and restaurant than as an actual hotel
eventually -PRON- may do that but for now no cigar
over the year -PRON- have be here to see a_few show
drink a_few drink watch many woman take -PRON- clothe off
-PRON- be burlesque
people get -PRON- mind out of the gutter
this be a pg-13 review
also for contact and just check the general art -PRON- have on -PRON- floor
all in all really good experience
so the gladstone realize -PRON- can live off just be a hotel so -PRON- go the -PRON- be a completely entertainment venue approach and -PRON- would say -PRON- have do well
with floor full of art one lounge one restaurant one semi large room for show a tiny hidden room for private party and gallery and an overall cool attitude -PRON- think -PRON- be do well
price be a_bit on the high_end of average which of_course -PRON- -PRON- be do to keep a little of that -PRON- be too cool for school cache that hipster love and that every one else try to justify with the exposed brick and retro decour and live_music
all in all -PRON- would say that -PRON- be definitely_worth the visit if there be some show -PRON- would like to check_out
not completely feel -PRON- as_far as a place to just drop by to hang_out or as a watering hole
maybe for -PRON- be the distance
or the fact_that at the end of all of thing aside_from the actual size of the place -PRON- can find the same elsewhere
not_sure but -PRON- would suggest -PRON- make -PRON- own choice and check -PRON- out
now that be what -PRON- call authentic
why drive 5 6_hour south when one step through these door will make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- just transport down south

-PRON- make_reservation over a week_ago
-PRON- eat out frequently
-PRON- show_up and -PRON- attempt to give -PRON- a table outdoors -PRON- be in the high 90 today
-PRON- say -PRON- do_not want to sit in the hot
the tell -PRON- -PRON- think -PRON- would this be not standard protocol at any az restaurant when -PRON- be hot
then -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- will have to wait 20 minutes-
-PRON- say fine-
the manager overhear the conversation and attempt to tell -PRON- -PRON- be nice outside
-PRON- be still wait for a table
terrible service
all -PRON- have to do be say sorry -PRON- make a mistake
can -PRON- buy -PRON- a drink while -PRON- wait
poor service at the hostess and management level
-PRON- come in here when -PRON- move into a new flat just around the corner and be hop to find a gem of a pub where -PRON- could come every now and then with a_few pal and chill
the pub seem to have undergo a_bit of an image change -PRON- use to be call banter but now with -PRON- more sophisticated name -PRON- think -PRON- be try to tap into the office worker crowd that -PRON- find on nearby morrison street and lothian road
the pub attempt to look upmarket and be not really the type_of place that -PRON- like to hang_out in -PRON- prefer a nice cosy pub-
but this really come_across as tailor to an_old crowd rather_than a student\/younger crowd
the pub do have however a pretty impressive widescreen tv that would be pretty_cool to watch the footie or rugby on but -PRON- doubt there would be any real atmosphere in there
-PRON- work with mark at encore to book a last_minute car for -PRON- wedding
-PRON- be impressed on all front
not only be -PRON- able_to get -PRON- an_amazing car for the event but -PRON- do so with an_amazing price
-PRON- also accommodate a last_minute schedule shift with no effort
-PRON- would gladly work with encore again and will be recommend -PRON- to all of -PRON- friend
this be not a farmer 's market
-PRON- be more like a craft\/food swap meet
price be outrageous
seriously -PRON- could have go to a strip cafe\/bakery and get a good deal
as for the gluten free\/organic stuff
-PRON- think place like wholefood sprout have the same_thing
nothing super special
one of those -PRON- have be there once and
that be all -PRON- need
great atmosphere and great food
seat -PRON- group_of 15 quite fast and easily
definitely_recommend to all
-PRON- use to love this petsmart

-PRON- call back the next_day the message be leave at night and be promptly tell by a rude employee that -PRON- could_not be give the test result on the phone because the vet -PRON- see would not be there until saturday this be a tuesday
-PRON- say -PRON- could see another vet but that -PRON- would have to wait for those test result to come_back too
-PRON- be tell repeatedly and rudely that -PRON- would not be able_to get the test result for -PRON- sick dog until five day_later
-PRON- ask to speak with the nurse that see -PRON- or another vet and be deny both until -PRON- be obviously upset and ask multiple_time
the nurse be just as unfriendly and tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not medically train and could_not read -PRON- the result
-PRON- ask if -PRON- have the result in front of -PRON- and could -PRON- please just read -PRON- to -PRON- and be tell no
after about_10_minute of this -PRON- say -PRON- would try to get another vet to read the result to -PRON- but -PRON- could_not guarantee -PRON-
later that day -PRON- call back and say the test be inconclusive and -PRON- would need to do another $ 400 test to get actual result
the vet -PRON- work with call -PRON- again a couple day_later tell -PRON- the same_thing and then say -PRON- be sorry -PRON- feel this be frustrating when -PRON- let -PRON- know of the other issue -PRON- have with other staff
-PRON- will not be go_back here ever for any service of any kind
this_location 's banfield staff do_not care_about the animal -PRON- serve -PRON- only care_about the money -PRON- pay -PRON- to do so
portion be always too small food be always bland always busy and unclean
there be way good chipotle to go to this one suck
-PRON- be lucky_enough to come when the line be not long around a 10_min wait before -PRON- place -PRON- order
-PRON- come maybe an_hour or so after -PRON- open
the employee who greet -PRON- at the door be super kind and very_knowledgeable about the flavour
-PRON- opt_for the -PRON- have meet -PRON- matcha and -PRON- friend get -PRON- new mango one
-PRON- be cool how -PRON- make the ice_cream right in front of -PRON- definitely make the experience unique
the matcha flavour definitely shin through -PRON- be not_overly bitter
-PRON- top the matcha one with whip_cream some type_of waffle crumb and pocky
the mango be also just as good if not good since -PRON- do use fresh mango when make -PRON-
very fresh and sweet
can_not remember what -PRON- be top with though
the portion_size be pretty big so -PRON- be good to share one between 2 people
by the end of -PRON- -PRON- kinda get sick of eat -PRON-
-PRON- be basically just cream but roll
feel_like -PRON- be eat a whole carton of heavy cream
very oiling and heavy
most_likely would never crave this -PRON- do prefer gelato and regular soft_serve over this any day
cool to try once if -PRON- have not before
terrible experience over the weekend when -PRON- family go for lunch
-PRON- be seat by the hostess
after wait 15_20 min for a server to come give -PRON- menus\/wait on -PRON- -PRON- have to go to the hostess and request -PRON-
-PRON- give the wrong one dinner
another 15_20 minute pass and -PRON- have to ask again if -PRON- have a server
after order take at_least an_hour to get -PRON- food
out of 7 meal only one be properly prepare burn veggie burger missing\/wrong ingredient brown lettuce wrong order
only receive drink refill when -PRON- question about where -PRON- food be
waitress be nice but absent
despite the great view -PRON- do_not recommend_this_place
this_place be a popular izakaya in ktown north that do buck a shuck oyster on tuesdays and wednesday
malpeque oyster be a buck each and fanny bay one go 8 for $_10 on these two day
make_sure to make a reservation on oyster day however as walk_in customer rarely get table
aside_from the oyster nomé be also good for -PRON- unique sushi_roll and izakaya style sharable dish
the menu be a_bit of hit or miss but -PRON- would_recommend the double salmon roll along_with the japa burgers and bulgogi tacos
the taco be legitimately the good korean fusion taco -PRON- have eat so_far
good pizza and wing in_vegas
-PRON- have many location and -PRON- deliver
the wing be crispy and -PRON- have multiple different seasoning and flavor
-PRON- usually prefer hot_wing but before -PRON- order -PRON- warn -PRON- that hot be a little spicy than other place

thankful -PRON- get -PRON- and will_definitely ask for -PRON- when -PRON- go_back
-PRON- do_not trust many_people with -PRON- hair but -PRON- go_above beyond what -PRON- want
go see julie everyone
do_not really care for the ice_cream
the process be very very cool
the line be long and move pretty slowly as everyone be explain the process
in the end -PRON- be pretty expensive and not mind_blow
-PRON- prefer classic ice_cream
not go to lie plenty_of people have have a bad_experience try to break the lease agreement at lvac and -PRON- have an_issue with -PRON- payment
-PRON- have a visa gift_card and ask -PRON- take money off that and the balance on -PRON- credit_card which -PRON- say -PRON- do
-PRON- have not -PRON- take both off the credit_card and do_not tell -PRON-
-PRON- complain and -PRON- attempt a couple of time to fix -PRON- but in the end -PRON- think -PRON- just decide -PRON- have spend enough time on -PRON- although -PRON- do offer -PRON- the chance to cancel the membership
but let -PRON- be realistic most people join a gym then never go so if -PRON- thinking of move out of vegas -PRON- maybe better off at a nationwide gym
apart from that -PRON- love the gym
-PRON- be modern always full of people usually -PRON- look_like the after photo which be nice to motivate -PRON-
but -PRON- think if -PRON- new to the gym scene -PRON- may provide a little insecurity about -PRON- own progress
but let -PRON- face -PRON-
most people be motivate by the pain of not have what -PRON- want so all in all a good thing for a little personal emotional discomfort
-PRON- also do zumba class there -PRON- move like a white man make of block of wood but -PRON- enjoy the time in the class despite -PRON- not really get any good at co ordination
lot_of workout station and the place be always full when ever -PRON- have be there which again just give -PRON- a sense of belong to a group_of people try to improve -PRON- life and make -PRON- feel good
-PRON- do_not allow a free week pass which be the first_time in -PRON- travel -PRON- have find this but again -PRON- personally think these kind_of gimmick be more of a sign that the gym need member rather_than a genuine service
-PRON- have membership discount at various outlet around las_vegas somewhere to put the kid while -PRON- work out a run track pool sauna etc etc
the place be large and all inclusive
come by after -PRON- cn tower climb ravenous and tired
this_place be perfect -PRON- miss the breakfast rush plenty_of table service be fast and very_friendly
-PRON- be happy with -PRON- portion_size and even_though -PRON- mess_up one order -PRON- quickly fix -PRON-
the food be delicious -PRON- all order the special and -PRON- all leave fully satisfied
only give -PRON- four_star because the price of the orange_juice
3 $ a glad be pretty steep for a medium sized glass especially when -PRON- can order a mimosa for the same price
all in all -PRON- be a great experience
and -PRON- will be back most definitely
let -PRON- start_off first by say this business have an f on bbb.org and -PRON- have just file a compliant with the ftc
mr. diaz and -PRON- have a dispute over financing while -PRON- be attempt to purchase a use vehicle from baja

-PRON- have visit with another doctor in this practice but not at_this_location for -PRON- annual since -PRON- have be in_vegas for the past 2 year
-PRON- be unfortunate enough to have schedule mine this year with detie
even_though -PRON- read some negative patient encounter evaluation of this individual -PRON- decide to schedule with -PRON- anyway since -PRON- gynecologist have be out for a while and -PRON- have an opening obviously
when -PRON- have come to this_location the front office be fine with -PRON- but the other experience be a sad case
-PRON- be a really difficult character trait to capture with have great bedside manner and tact
detie walk_in the room and tell -PRON- -PRON- be angela and ahe would be do the exam for -PRON-
-PRON- also begin to spew out what -PRON- have scribe on the patient document and then when -PRON- ask -PRON- question -PRON- be obviously hostile and appear to be combative
-PRON- will just say that -PRON- pcp be a nurse practitioner which be very smart and proactive along_with the internal medicine doctor that be in the practice
ms. detie will be the last practioner that -PRON- will see for gynecological service
-PRON- be not_sure where the credentialing come from
but -PRON- know that -PRON- have no trust in -PRON- ability because of such a lack of tack for respond appropriately to question
-PRON- do_not have any confidence that this individual would even know_what to look for should adverse result come_back
-PRON- definitely will not be make another appearance here or jeopardize -PRON- health
make -PRON- own decision with who -PRON- want to see
but -PRON- have find yelp to be very_helpful with make decision on person like this
-PRON- go to this spot for -PRON- anniversary dinner and -PRON- be definitely cozy and romantic although a_bit dark due_to the lighting and ambiance
-PRON- get the sea_bass and the gnocchi as the main_course and -PRON- be just the right_amount_of fill while feel not_overly stuff
the affogato be refreshing as a dessert and definitely_recommend

while the great review_on_yelp lead -PRON- here the incredible customer_service and skilled team at snapdragon will keep -PRON- a customer indefinitely
this local_business have more_than earn -PRON- community follow
maybe the mistake to think this would have be a good lunch
the food be subpar at good
the price be affordable but the pizza be below_average
too_many good choice in_phoenix to spend money here
-PRON- be usually not a fan_of the island bar atmosphere at restaurant like this but -PRON- burger and service be awesome enough to keep -PRON- come_back
the burger be huge serve on soft brioche bun the bun make the burger and super juicy
the pesto aioli be really good with both the fry and sweet_potato tot even_though -PRON- sound weird

ask -PRON- to open up -PRON- purse to search -PRON- thing and -PRON- step in and tell -PRON- to back off and give -PRON- justification to -PRON- questioning
-PRON- friend be get heated and before -PRON- know -PRON- -PRON- almost have a fight
-PRON- hold -PRON- friend back but honestly this woman have -PRON- come
-PRON- want to crack -PRON- in the face -PRON-
-PRON- eventually leave and -PRON- later find out from a random person that the lady be the owner
be -PRON- freak kid -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- be drunk or high by -PRON- behavior and be way out of line to -PRON- friend
-PRON- also find out -PRON- have major problem with drug and the cop have be there regularly
that do_not excuse the treatment to -PRON- customer especially be the owner and act unprofessionally drunk and trashy
needless_to_say -PRON- will not be go_back there ever again
-PRON- go here with 5 woman
the atmosphere be nice -PRON- be seat outside
the restaurant be not full
the menu be expensive but -PRON- be expect that
-PRON- service be awful
make the meal the bad of the trip
not only do -PRON- drink take at_least 15_min to get -PRON- have to find the server to place -PRON- order
then -PRON- food take_forever
the server then_proceed to bring -PRON- shot to make up for the fact_that -PRON- be not around
-PRON- say -PRON- be take_care_of the president of the hotel so have to cater to -PRON-
so -PRON- be pay_$ $_$ $_$ to -PRON- company and -PRON- cater to -PRON-
no will not be go_back or recommend -PRON-
oh and -PRON- woman have work in the industry

-PRON- husband and -PRON- love -PRON- cheesecake -PRON- be -PRON- absolute_favorite
every_time -PRON- go there -PRON- be greet with friendly people even_though -PRON- only order -PRON- cheesecake to go
the bartender who take -PRON- order be great and get -PRON- order out quickly
can_not wait to actually sit_down for a nice dinner soon
marketer attempt to get -PRON- money
-PRON- try every which way to convince -PRON- that -PRON- must have -PRON- company 's product
at one time -PRON- divide consumer into target group believe at every age -PRON- taste change
despite so_many young yelper comment marketer discover age no_longer matter as senior look and behave more like cher and less like barbara bush
a fairly recent marketing approach be the experience
to attract customer a restaurant must offer more_than just a cold beer or a ham sandwich
restaurant now offer entertainment in what look_like a movie setting
fake this fake that
seven roses be a real experience
-PRON- think -PRON- be unique to -PRON- city
now that some film be be make in cleveland -PRON- expect to see jennifer aniston help -PRON- to sauerkraut at the buffet on the screen of -PRON- local regal theater
seven roses seem to be totally run by woman with only a_few speak_english
-PRON- sell bakery deli home make smoke_meat prepared food import can good and have a buffet
the building be old and the wall be fill with wooden shelf hold jar and can and adorn with lace
small wooden table and chair be in the back
old pope john paul would have be happy here
the buffet continue throughout the day with the cook bring_out tray frequently
the dish change daily and hourly
small stuff cabbage be one of the only dish that be always available
-PRON- be not polish
so -PRON- do_not like every dish nor do -PRON- know_what many be
that hold true for the bakery and deli as_well
the thing -PRON- have like keep -PRON- come_back
last evening -PRON- go with two friend
-PRON- think the buffet be not at -PRON- good as_far as the offering with too_many ground meat dish
no_matter -PRON- all manage to overeat and leave happy
-PRON- have learn to go right to the buffet in the back
that way -PRON- can pass the bakery and deli stuff on -PRON- way out not want to buy everything -PRON- see
really delicious food but a little salty
somehow -PRON- always end_up with a stomach ache after eat -PRON- food
this be not a typical fast_food american chinese place

for -PRON- however the food be wonderful
-PRON- love the taiwanese sausage the shredded pancake the marinate beef
if -PRON- order something that be actually from the taiwanese chinese cuisine -PRON- think -PRON- will be impressed
pay particular attention to the front page meal deal
the cafe in the name come from -PRON- origin -PRON- be originally just a small cafe that serve bubble_tea and some random taiwanese snack
several year_ago -PRON- renovate and turn_into a tiny restaurant
the decor improve dramatically and -PRON- do enjoy sit there to eat
-PRON- bubble_tea be still some of the good in pittsburgh so be sure to give that a try
absolutely_love this studio
great location instructor joanne and bebo be amazing and -PRON- have the good playlist
-PRON- be never a fan_of cycling but -PRON- take biker barre to a different level
love tenpoint5
when -PRON- find -PRON- in the more upscale casino in_vegas -PRON- will often find -PRON- press to find affordable food
secret_pizza in the cosmpolitan be always a fan favorite but sometimes -PRON- just want to try something out
enter five50
-PRON- find the line in secret_pizza always really intimidate when -PRON- be just really hungry for a quick slice and five50 locate_in aria be a great alternative
line be never really long and pizza be just as great
what secret_pizza lack in variety five50 offer more unique flavor
still -PRON- would say the price have something leave to be desire
$ 5.50 be a_bit hefty for a slice of pizza and although -PRON- be a large slice -PRON- can_not say -PRON- be all too happy parting with -PRON- cash
nonetheless still a very solid pizza place and -PRON- definitely be worth_check_out if -PRON- be ever sick of secret_pizza and look for a change of pace
-PRON- would just raise one caveat though
beware of the soda price
-PRON- be look to grab a quick can of soda and the price end_up be $_10 for the combo of a slice and soda
lo and behold -PRON- charge_$ 4.50 for a can of soda
whereas -PRON- do_not_mind get rip_off if offer in tap -PRON- be nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can -PRON- can get from a grocery_store
$ 2-$3
sure $_4.50 please no
tip
get -PRON- soda elsewhere
-PRON- come_here on a saturday evening
start with the hummus and an order of chef borek
amazing
tasty perfectly do crust remind -PRON- of a huge step up from spinach pie
-PRON- bring -PRON- wine with -PRON- and the waiter though apparently somewhat confused uncorked and bring -PRON- glass
then -PRON- friend order the falafel and -PRON- order the lamb adana kabob
the waiter ask -PRON- be -PRON- sure -PRON- want to order that
-PRON- ask if there be something wrong with -PRON-
again confused -PRON- say that -PRON- think -PRON- would order something_else
somewhat disconcert -PRON- think
both dish be delicious
falafel do perfectly -PRON- lamb tasty and just enough spice to -PRON-
finish up with baklava and turkish tea
yummy
-PRON- will certainly come_here again
would have definitely give -PRON- a 5 except for the waiter
-PRON- have have two experience with md 's cooling both time with miguel
first_time -PRON- be call by the folk that property manage one of -PRON- rental just to do an a\/c check
-PRON- discover the fan need to be replace and -PRON- call -PRON- to see if -PRON- could be cover under warranty
very nice_touch
from that experience -PRON- call -PRON- to check_out the duct in -PRON- residence
-PRON- have have an energy audit and that person say that all of -PRON- duct need to be replace and seal to the tune of $_1000
miguel come_out and say one duct need to be replace the rest_of the duct look fine and -PRON- have already be seal
-PRON- do recommend seal all of -PRON- register because there be gap between the metal sheeting and drywall
total cost for everything
$ 275
super_nice guy and
-PRON- think very honest
stay_here because -PRON- have same player club as rail city here in reno
have a non smoking room on forth floor and -PRON- be a very_nice room
the lady at the check in\/player club desk be very_helpful
free breakfast buffet be not bad but try the dinner buffet and -PRON- be 95 percent inedible
-PRON- be allmost comical
-PRON- have be to some pretty crappy buffet but this be by_far the bad
not a big_deal though because -PRON- in_vegas so dinner option be unlimited
parking_garage be easy access from room which be a bonus
fantastic decor if -PRON- a motor enthusiast however no_matter how -PRON- get distract visually -PRON- can_not disguise a mediocre at good meal small over price portion and average service next_time ill go over the road to subway
-PRON- be so impressed_with danielle
-PRON- be so professional and knowledgeable and really go the extra mile for -PRON- sugaring
-PRON- will probably never resort to get just a plain wax again
-PRON- do such a good job with none_of the associate adverse effect -PRON- can have with a wax
thank -PRON-
-PRON- really love this grocery_store
-PRON- be in seven hills in competition with 3 other grocery_store and a farmer 's market but the variety\/price and quality be balance to a t here
-PRON- get salad carbonate water yogurt soy milk soup pre_make food fruit\/veg sale and deal item
the cosmetic aisle be small and skincare aisle modest
fresh produce be a deal when -PRON- be bogo donut be surprisingly low price here
attempt catering for hot food here
but -PRON- be one of -PRON- busy day -PRON- be hard to be flexible when -PRON- be busy- timing be not right
-PRON- do have markdown on grocery like salad soy milk and yogurt and -PRON- love those up to 65 off
in the future when -PRON- do multiple grocery_store shopping for deal this one be first choice on most day
employee give great service and be super_nice here
run into a fellow_yelper whom -PRON- have be follow for year on_yelp
quite a coincidence -PRON- be both in the same place at the same time
-PRON- be the 3 party to arrive right when -PRON- open and -PRON- have reservation
-PRON- see about_15 20 people walk_around the place that all work there
the party that be here before -PRON- have -PRON- first course meal before -PRON- even get menu
wish -PRON- have -PRON- server as this be thanksgiving day
and -PRON- want to check_out the black friday deal without sit in a restaurant for 2 + hour
-PRON- wait 20_minute for someone to come take -PRON- drink order and then bring -PRON- the main menu
the good peking duck salad wonton_soup
yang chow fry_rice braised pork_belly complimentary chrysanthemum tea pomegranate sorbet
the bad
pan sear strip bass so dry shrimp toast way_too greasy
5 spice dessert nasty flavor that do_not work together
-PRON- find this_place very expensive for average quality food
-PRON- understand that this_place be the first chinese place in the usa to get award a michelin star
which -PRON- find crazy -PRON- must have be a long_time ago or when this_place have good food and service
after go to hakkassan in_vegas mgm 2 time and -PRON- have be award a michelin star as_well and -PRON- serve chinese_food which -PRON- find to be a lot good_than wing lei by both the food quality and the service
do_not think -PRON- will be come_back any time soon
hapa hour
5:30 6:30 every_day half price app
imagine -PRON- have access to the good of the good app that -PRON- have and not have to feel gulity about -PRON-
-PRON- lovely friend_who be not easily impressed be bowl over by the polenta fry and deep_fry shrimp
the wrap be amazing and the drink be flow with citrusy abandon
the service be sexy and impeccable
-PRON- be beautiful and friendly
how utterly charming
-PRON- be go_back there again and again and maybe even have a nice party there
why not
hapa good time
-PRON- doctor put -PRON- prescription in thursday and -PRON- be suppose to start -PRON- the same_day and now -PRON- be saturday
and -PRON- be close
so -PRON- have to wait until sunday if -PRON- be even ready
-PRON- normally come_here
but -PRON- will not anymore
this be rediculous
go to mcdonalds to get what -PRON- expect
cheap meal on the strip
split the 20 piece nugget with -PRON- mom and get two double cheeseburger which -PRON- do_not even eat hello breakfast for $_7 would not be so_excited normally but pay upwards of $_30 a person make -PRON- really_appreciate what mcdonalds have to offer
for $_5 more this one offer 2 complete meal
go here for a cheap meal anytime
-PRON- decide to bring -PRON- little baby here after_read review and -PRON- be very glad -PRON- do
-PRON- dog look very cute and -PRON- be so happy after visit the groomer
-PRON- finish earlier than -PRON- expect
-PRON- be definitely bring -PRON- dog here again
try the eclair chocolate vanilla
absolutely wonderfull
the vanilla be make with real vanilla bean no extract or flavor
filling be light creamy
moderate pricing for such a high_quality product
the eclair cost $_5.00 for the two and each eclair be about eight inch long
-PRON- would have gladly pay_$ 5.00 for just one
so -PRON- be look for a place for asian style ice_cream and someplace like bang bang ice_cream downtown in markham and -PRON- find woofles cream
at first glance -PRON- look_like -PRON- could be promising
-PRON- order the black and white sesame waffle and green_tea soft_serve
the soft_serve be smooth but the waffle be not to par
-PRON- be too crispy and flavourless
-PRON- definitely need to find a good recipe for the waffle if -PRON- be to return
-PRON- would_rather drive downtown and wait the 1.5 hour to get a decent egg waffle and real quality ice_cream
this_place be twice as big on the inside as -PRON- appear from the outside
in_addition to the main showroom which be organize loosely by type_of stuff bead handbag silver china military decoration that kind_of category there be about_10 little room off to the side that be set_up like as the room of the person whose estate the stuff in the room come from
there 's lot_of actual good stuff which actually outnumber the amount_of the usual stupid antique store dusty crap
-PRON- be go to go_back soon and buy a bookshelf -PRON- see
highly_recommend
great food great bar scene perfect service
ate here last_night and be very_impressed
service be top_notch and the server be smart enough to not crowd the table with too_much food at one time
pace -PRON- as -PRON- finish different app
will certainly be back again
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- dining_experience here for the most_part
-PRON- be bear in raise in north florida though and have very high_standard for southern cuisine
-PRON- din with -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- have a live social for 1 app 2 entree and 1 dessert
good thing -PRON- do though because -PRON- still end_up spend_$ 40 on 4 drink and the tip
but_hey -PRON- be uptown -PRON- need to start accept that
or should -PRON-
-PRON- thoroughly_enjoy the fry oyster appetizer
-PRON- come with a bacon vinaigrette and cocktail sauce for dipping
-PRON- be not wow by the vinaigrette like -PRON- think -PRON- would be but the cocktail sauce make up for -PRON-
-PRON- both order the meat and 3 and -PRON- both order flounder as the meat
-PRON- always try to order something_different from -PRON- but -PRON- just be not feel the other option of salmon flank steak or fry_chicken yes the chicken be tempting but -PRON- do_not want to have to pick at anything during -PRON- meal
-PRON- think the flounder be fry perfectly
-PRON- be a little salty but -PRON- have a salty palate so -PRON- like -PRON-
the side be what -PRON- really think could have be good
when -PRON- think about southern cuisine -PRON- be all about the side bottom_line
-PRON- order the mac_n_cheese cheese grit and mash cream potato
the potato be pretty_good but -PRON- make good mac_n_cheese and grit at home
when -PRON- go out for southern cuisine -PRON- want to eat food that be good_than what -PRON- make -PRON-
the mac do_not have enough cheese and taste very eggy
the grit be not thick enough and make -PRON- wish -PRON- have order something_different
-PRON- can_not really remember what -PRON- have as side
oh_well
the dessert leave something to be desire as_well
-PRON- do_not taste homemade but who know
-PRON- have the turtle pie
-PRON- would eat_here again with a living social but honestly if -PRON- be in search of get -PRON- southern fat kid on -PRON- be head over to dish
the worst service
do_not buy from here
absolutely_horrible
-PRON- boyfriend want to surprise -PRON- for valentine_'s_day and have flower deliver to -PRON- work
-PRON- specify that the flower have to arrive by 5_p.m. because that be when -PRON- leave
-PRON- leave work late that night
-PRON- be a friday at about 6_p.m. and still no flower be in sight
-PRON- do_not even call -PRON- to notify -PRON- that the flower could_not be deliver
the only_reason -PRON- find out be because -PRON- call -PRON- to see_how -PRON- like -PRON-
the poor guy scramble to buy -PRON- whatev -PRON- could find at the store so sweet -PRON- really do_not have to
on_tuesday -PRON- be a long weekend some time after noon someone finally drop the flower off at -PRON- work and give -PRON- to whoever answer the front_door
-PRON- do_not even call or page -PRON-
when -PRON- receive the flower -PRON- be wilt and soak wet as if -PRON- be out in the rain all weekend
tldr
-PRON- deliver the flower 4 day after valentine_'s_day and -PRON- be wilt and wet
have dinner on 12\/10
overpriced
pushy waiter who spend most of -PRON- time try to upsell -PRON-
discourage -PRON- from order sushi for dinner or the chicken
interesting only_thing less_than $_30 on the menu
wait over_an_hour for dinner
manager come by and apologize say -PRON- would be only 5_minute wait another 15_minute
steak be mediocre
seafood be good but extremely pricey
would not recommend and will not go_back
dinner and app and drink for 4 be $ 550 include tip
one of edinburgh 's old and fine butcher george bowman 's on grt junction st have top quality meat and truly excellent scotch pie
-PRON- whole family have always buy -PRON- meat and pie from here and always will
blackstone be a fairly new steakhouse in the gta and -PRON- go during opening week
-PRON- have make_reservation early for -PRON- birthday for a party of 6 with 2 kid everything be set and ready for -PRON- when -PRON- arrive
the chef specifically come_out to welcome -PRON- and explain the menu
-PRON- mention that -PRON- be not -PRON- set menu as -PRON- hope to have more item on the menu in the next few_week
-PRON- have buy -PRON- fresh bread with oil to munch on as -PRON- wait for the rest_of -PRON- friend
-PRON- end_up get the steak on a lava stone which be deliciously marinate and serve with a compound butter mushroom sauce and a grainy spread
additionally -PRON- receive a side of mash_potato veggie as_well_as a complimentary ceaser salad
each item be super flavorful and taste very high_end in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- only concern be the veggie that taste a little bland otherwise everything_else be amazing
-PRON- also have dessert which be the crème
brulee
-PRON- think this be something -PRON- can improve on as -PRON- taste eggy but the dinner be so good that -PRON- do_not even care_about the dessert
overall the food service and ambiance of blackstone be superb
-PRON- would_recommend this steak over affy 's and crave grill house
-PRON- be actually on another level with all of the additional sauce -PRON- come with as_well_as the marination of the steak -PRON-
-PRON- understand that cook -PRON- own steak may not be appetizing for some
but that be part of the experience which for -PRON- group_of friend -PRON- really_enjoy
if -PRON- have a mailbox here count on get other people 's mail in -PRON- box and get -PRON- mail in other people 's box
otherwise nice
friendly
helpful
-PRON- be give this_company 3_star because of the following the customer_service be excellent once -PRON- get someone on the phone
-PRON- be personable and arrive at the property promptly and fix the problem
however
rodney f. be accurate when -PRON- state that the website 's number for emergency be not an accurate number
-PRON- have to number hop just like -PRON- do
-PRON- complain_about this
-PRON- feel -PRON- be vague in -PRON- explanation and do_not really take -PRON- complaint seriously to do anything to change the narrative
-PRON- almost fall over when -PRON- charge -PRON- over $ 800 to stop a water tank leak which be cause flooding in the garage
-PRON- realize -PRON- be after hour but -PRON- feel -PRON- take_advantage_of -PRON- because -PRON- be call from out of state
come_here pretty often before class
great little place with friendly owner
-PRON- know -PRON- will always be welcome when -PRON- walk_through the door
also one of the good rainbow_roll in_town
place a mobile order on 10\/27 at 7:04am at 7:25am -PRON- have to go in and cancel -PRON- order because -PRON- be go to be late for work
be tell -PRON- have a late start
ps not -PRON- problem
at that time the manager be go to give -PRON- a refund back to the mobile app
a week_later still no refund
-PRON- call the store on thursday speak to the manager at around 9:00am for -PRON- to tell -PRON- -PRON- could_not locate the transaction and need to talk to the area or regional manager
-PRON- then take -PRON- phone_number and say -PRON- will call -PRON- back shortly
so as of today guess who do_not get a call back nor -PRON- refund
now -PRON- be pissed and this need to be fix asap
-PRON- will post a daily negative_review until this matter be resolve
oh forget to mention -PRON- order be only 2 hash_brown and the free breakfast sandwich total a whopping $ 2.49 cent refund
now -PRON- be a matter of the principle which clearly -PRON- have none
come in this morning and by_far the bad most pathetic customer_service ever
understandably -PRON- be busy
but as -PRON- be stand at the podium -PRON- get no one to even remotely acknowledge -PRON- such_as possibly good morning -PRON- will be right with -PRON-
-PRON- do_not even lift -PRON- head but put -PRON- head down as if to avoid -PRON-
-PRON- be not the only one who be stand around wait to even have someone approach
be in the customer_service industry a simple acknowledgement go a long way
one of -PRON- car be be service however after this and have experience this twice -PRON- be purchase remain 2 vehicle elsewhere
suggestion as be in the customer_service industry when someone walk up to -PRON- desk a simple acknowledgment can speak volume versus silence and run away
this be -PRON- first_time actually dining here
-PRON- will qualify this by state that -PRON- husband go once with a friend and really like -PRON- and bring -PRON- back blood sausage which be quite good
that be a couple of year_ago
the second_time -PRON- try to go there on a weekend night with a couple of friend
-PRON- sit_down promptly but then no one come to take -PRON- drink order or any_other order for probably about twenty_minute so -PRON- get up and leave
so that lead -PRON- to lunch the other day
-PRON- be hopeful that lunch would have good service than -PRON- last dinner experience and -PRON- do
the order be take relatively quick however the food take_awhile to arrive and flag_down the waiter be rather difficult in order to get drink refill or the check
so overall service go down hill
as to the food -PRON- have the bibimbap which be good although -PRON- have have good island style for one
also order the dumpling again good but not noteworthy
so the food be solid but not phenomenal
-PRON- prefer -PRON- when the banchan be bring at the beginning too
-PRON- can_not remember what other place have do or what be traditional but that be just -PRON- preference
here the banchan be bring along_with the main entree
in regard to the ambience
-PRON- believe other yelper have state -PRON- be very k pop here
and -PRON- agree
-PRON- could see -PRON- be a lively venue for a weekend night
music be loud and for lunch -PRON- be almost to loud to visit and enjoy especially_since -PRON- be not_too_crowded
the decor be industrial but appealing however -PRON- sit on the bench with no back
would have prefer a back to the seat especially in light of the somewhat slow service
overall glad that -PRON- put aside -PRON- ill feeling before and give -PRON- a chance
the food be solid but -PRON- be unlikely -PRON- will be back as -PRON- be not noteworthy and there be so_many other place to try
on one last note which would be add above excempt -PRON- computer be have issue right_now
the selection be more extensive than other korean place -PRON- have be and -PRON- have a_few decent beer although -PRON- do_not imbibe
-PRON- have either hitachino or morimoto soba ale -PRON- think -PRON- be the latter either_way -PRON- be both great beer that be difficult to find in restaurant
go to see dr. k 3 time and -PRON- be very rude and do_not listen to what -PRON- have to say at all
-PRON- do_not_care for the patient
-PRON- will be see someone_else
beware
don't
see this doctor
a waste of time
-PRON- also wait in the office for over_an_hour
the nurse take 4 patient that come after -PRON- first
-PRON- can hear the nurse talk so loud about -PRON- personal business
-PRON- be the only doctor -PRON- see in the office at the henderson location
not a good place to go at all
very unprofessional
when -PRON- go out to eat -PRON- so and -PRON- like to order different meal so that -PRON- can sample a variety_of food from the restaurant
in particular to sushi restaurant -PRON- usually get some raw_fish and -PRON- so get a bento with cook food
here at sushi house -PRON- order the salmon chirashi and -PRON- get a bento
the bento be not too special but the chirashi be very good
the rice be well_season with a generous_portion of salmon along_with other little condiment on the side like marinate mushroom and pickle radish
after the first_time -PRON- always order the same_thing
the owner and chef be korean and so the sushi be a_bit different from japanese or chinese sushi
good burger -PRON- burger good_than -PRON- expect
very good light bun and good beef
the restaurant be very busy on a saturday_afternoon which make the service very slow
-PRON- would go_back and try a different burger
yum
-PRON- mom and -PRON- eat_here for lunch and -PRON- both enjoy everything that -PRON- order
the food take -PRON- back to la if -PRON- have be out west -PRON- will know that this be a great compliment
-PRON- order at the front then pick -PRON- table and -PRON- food will be bring_out to -PRON-
-PRON- get the elote loco corn w\/ mayo cojito cheese and chili powder from the street food section
-PRON- mom get the chicken empanada -PRON- get the curtido fish_taco and of_course -PRON- get guac
first of all
the corn
that be by_far -PRON- favorite part of the lunch
-PRON- mom empanada have shred chicken and and cheese inside -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- and say the flavor be all there
-PRON- tilapia taco be so so so good
-PRON- have what -PRON- call curtido slaw which -PRON- believe be some_sort_of pickle cabbage and carrot along_with tomato and cilantro
the fish be grill and cook to perfection
the price of everything be pretty reasonable also
another aspect that -PRON- like about the place be that -PRON- be very vegetarian friendly
be a vegetarian -PRON- be nice to see that there be many different option for -PRON- to have
-PRON- also have a salsa_bar which be a plus
if this be just base_on food -PRON- would receive 5_star
the reason -PRON- give -PRON- 4_star be because -PRON- could definitely use a makeover and the wait service be kind_of non_existent
-PRON- would be nice if the server check up on -PRON- everyone and a while
besides that the food be awesome and -PRON- will absolutely go_back
-PRON- be able_to get a highly competitive rate for a direct flight out of fl to dc
ticket be immediately confirm and send to -PRON- mailbox before -PRON- close the lid to -PRON- computer
-PRON- flight be not until september
but -PRON- foresee no_problem at this time
thank -PRON- for help -PRON- stay on budget
so -PRON- stay_at the doubletree resort and be look for a pizza place that deliver and find this_place
when -PRON- be deliver -PRON- be not that impressed_with what -PRON- look_like
but when -PRON- eat -PRON- -PRON- be highly impressed
the pizza be delicious and -PRON- be very happy
-PRON- do_not live on this side of town but if -PRON- come_back
-PRON- will_definitely_come_back to this pizza place
absolutely_delicious
the furniture be not set_up in the most organized fashion but rather kind_of just place wherever there be open space
on the other_hand -PRON- do have quite the selection
there be numerous different style and piece_of furniture for -PRON- to try out
if -PRON- do_not find something in the store -PRON- like or be want a different feel there be plenty_of catalog the employee be happy to order from for -PRON-
the customer_service be splendid and -PRON- do_not feel_like the employee be ready to pounce for a sale
also the price be extremely reasonable for furniture
this be surely a place people should stop in at before go to those overprice furniture store
muy bueno
this be spot be way off the strip but nothing too crazy
-PRON- worth the 10_minute drive base_on taste customer_service and quality of food
-PRON- need -PRON- ceviche and this_place deliver more_than_enough
go for lunch and hostess be so thoughtful as -PRON- be wait for another couple to join -PRON- and -PRON- be early
as more folk come in -PRON- recognize and ask if -PRON- want to be seat
server be equally friendly and patient
-PRON- love that -PRON- have some light option as -PRON- know the normal portion be large
other couple have never be to a black bear diner and -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- as_well
not_sure about the negative_review -PRON- be very positive
-PRON- love -PRON- tuna salad
the other have burger basket and really_enjoy -PRON- as_well
-PRON- laptop seem to be very hot -PRON- be afraid something be wrong
-PRON- blow the dust out say -PRON- should be ok
but as long as -PRON- be there -PRON- have a sign that will do a tuneup for $_75
-PRON- computer be run pretty slow -PRON- just assume -PRON- be cox -PRON- internet provider
pc plus clean -PRON- up very_nice now -PRON- be run great
-PRON- could_not be happy
-PRON- so want to give this_place a high_rating but -PRON- just can_not
-PRON- want to love_this_place and -PRON- keep try to
but alas -PRON- keep fail -PRON-
maybe -PRON- just have a knack for come at the wrong time and choose the wrong menu_item
the menu_item always sound enticing
there be always so_many thing -PRON- want to eat_here
but -PRON- have always leave disappointed
the wing be ok but not good enough to even finish a little too greasy and fatty
though the blue_cheese which be serve warm be excellent
the truffle_fry be just overwhelm by bad truffle oil
the mac_n_cheese top with doritos be interesting but not worth a repeat eat
the expensive truffle and foie_gra cheesesteak be a failure of epic proportion
and just how be -PRON- that -PRON- can manage to make a wedge salad taste bad
the pretzel and dipping_sauce be the good thing here
and do_not even get -PRON- start on the cocktail
just stick with the beer list
-PRON- love the set_up and decor
-PRON- be a great spot
-PRON- be exactly_what -PRON- would want out of a 24-hour place in an upscale casino
-PRON- be just dark enough
-PRON- be just large enough
and -PRON- have an_excellent bar_area -PRON- preferred seating section
-PRON- can be way_too loud sometimes though
and -PRON- have yet to have a good service experience here
everyone always just seem rather unfriendly inattentive and a_bit on the arrogant side
as odd as -PRON- sound eat seafood out of plastic bag be not as bad
sound gross
but -PRON- be a unique concept and -PRON- do_not have to worry_about get messy because pretty_much everybody eat there be go to get messy
-PRON- would_recommend the mussel with the captain boil sauce
-PRON- try other sauce
but -PRON- be tell -PRON- captain boil be the good
the cajun fry be okay in -PRON- opinion
nothing_special but if -PRON- be up for more flavouring on the fry -PRON- just dip -PRON- in the captain boil sauce -PRON- have from -PRON- seafood
yes -PRON- know sound gross haha
wait be not fun
-PRON- suggest make_reservation unless -PRON- want to wait or loiter around
at_least -PRON- will text -PRON- when -PRON- spot be ready
this_establishment open -PRON- door last_week
so -PRON- decide to try -PRON- out today
-PRON- frequent that area quite a_bit and think -PRON- be a wonderful addition to the surround business
-PRON- order a peach sorbet for -PRON- and a cotton_candy single scoop of ice_cream for -PRON- guest
the ice cream\/sorbet be both tasty
customer_service be really good while place -PRON- order
-PRON- let -PRON- sample -PRON- sorbet before decide to get -PRON-
the interior of the shop be sleek and modern
-PRON- definitely have a more adult ice_cream shop\/coffee shop feel to -PRON- in comparison to a baskin robbins
-PRON- plan on try some of -PRON- drink next_time
-PRON- be there
-PRON- have a ton_of specialty coffee and tea selection
look_forward_to -PRON- next_visit
-PRON- be write a review to specifically comment_on the outstanding work of this facility
-PRON- be confuse as to how this office receive such negative_review
every_single experience that -PRON- have have at this practice have be extraordinary from the moment -PRON- step through the door to the time -PRON- leave
everyone in the front office staff be incredibly nice
there be a front office male who go_above and beyond to help individual
if -PRON- job entail just check people in -PRON- have go beyond that
-PRON- have practice medicine\/healing\/health care just by communicate with those -PRON- have check in
the woman_who sit on the right and the two woman_who do the scheduling upon discharge be incredibly nice as_well
-PRON- be always in a good mood and share a positive attitude with other patient as -PRON- leave
the patient be always laugh with -PRON- every_time -PRON- leave so -PRON- be really uncertain as to how there could be negative_review stem from a positive environment
everything be easy efficient and execute in a timely_manner
the office be consistently able_to schedule appointment very quickly
-PRON- have see quite a number_of physician over the last few_year due_to -PRON- extensive medical history and -PRON- have the opportunity to meet with dr. tyler southwell who truly reinforce the value of what -PRON- mean to be a physician
-PRON- sit_down and patiently listen to the entire history before ask question that would aide -PRON- in -PRON- prognosis
-PRON- be extremely intelligent incorporate -PRON- patience experience evident extensive scientific knowledge and understanding to work with -PRON- in prognosis
-PRON- have read that many patient now use online tool to explore treatment because -PRON- do_not feel that physician explain all aspect of treatment
dr. tyler southwell go_above and beyond by explain the diagnosis typical because and all aspect of treatment
-PRON- treat the source rather_than the symptom
-PRON- be ` truly ` the definition of what -PRON- mean to be a physician
-PRON- be sorry -PRON- can_not comment_on the other physician in the office as -PRON- do_not have the opportunity to meet with -PRON- but if -PRON- be reflective of dr. tyler southwell then this entire facility be the definition of medicine\/health care
really great place
-PRON- have dinner there tonight and sadly have the place to -PRON-
however unlike a lot_of place that just seem to give up when -PRON- do_not have a lot_of business on a particular night the staff at saffron seem to be work extra hard for -PRON- approval
-PRON- hostess\/waitress be very_friendly and accommodate ensure that -PRON- have everything -PRON- need without hover
the food be absolutely excellent as_well
-PRON- husband have a lamb dish which -PRON- order medium spicy while -PRON- have the mattar paneer at no spice
both of -PRON- be delicious and season perfectly
-PRON- do_not seem to fall_into the trap that more spice = more flavor that -PRON- have encounter at some place where a 5 actually equal nuclear reactor in -PRON- mouth hot
now that -PRON- know -PRON- have a fine hand at spice -PRON- may actually order a little heat next_time
-PRON- also get the cheese naan which -PRON- highly_recommend
tender fill with just enough cheese to add flavor and texture without make -PRON- greasy
-PRON- menu be just long enough to give -PRON- lot_of option but not so long that -PRON- be overwhelming
-PRON- have a huge vegetarian section with lot_of choice for even the picky_eater
long_story_short -PRON- will be back
hopefully next_time -PRON- will be full to the rafter busy
only go to lopez to introduce -PRON- young charge to fry ice_cream but dang do -PRON- help -PRON- case
-PRON- be convinced and -PRON- be convinced that -PRON- would eat_here next_time -PRON- be in northeast ohio and save room for dessert
good place to stop for a casual drink and a bite to eat
definitely would not choose here for anything beyond that
spotty service
food be decent tho
the first_time -PRON- go in the staff be friendly and office be very impressive
nice decor
-PRON- actually buy the groupon and -PRON- be not_sure if that have anything to do with the treatment -PRON- have receive after that first_visit
-PRON- give -PRON- trial first and ask -PRON- to follow_up with -PRON- to tell -PRON- how -PRON- be
trial be give to -PRON- multiple_time because -PRON- astigmatism be high and -PRON- eye would not tolerate or adjust when -PRON- give -PRON- toric biofinity at -PRON- true rx
finally -PRON- give -PRON- a trial of a low intensity that work
acuvue but -PRON- be only the weekly and -PRON- follow_up to let -PRON- know so -PRON- could place the order for the monthly version_of that
groupon call for 6_month supply not even exaggerate about 4 5 week come and go and -PRON- contact be not ready
-PRON- have call up a_few time but to -PRON- dismay the tech that be help -PRON- in the beginning be no long with -PRON-
-PRON- finally speak to sherise who basically take over and say there be back up order
-PRON- ask -PRON- to come_back in to verify -PRON- rx with the dr.
be -PRON- really necessary to make -PRON- drive all the way from across_town just to get another trial
because when -PRON- go_back to see the doctor -PRON- end_up prescribe -PRON- with the same low intensity in the monthly toric bifinity which -PRON- have already know -PRON- need
and -PRON- have already previously explain that that rx be fine
sherise call about a week_later to come pick_up an_additional trial
again drive all the way from henderson to summerlin
-PRON- tell -PRON- to follow_up and let -PRON- know_how -PRON- fall
-PRON- call -PRON- up a_few day_later
tell -PRON- to order -PRON-
-PRON- explain -PRON- would be pay about $ 30.00 more for the astigmatism which be fine -PRON- guess but the first tech never explain this to -PRON- to begin with
so now here -PRON- be 2_week later check to see if -PRON- be finally ready and guess_what the order be never actually place
-PRON- say -PRON- be still wait on -PRON- to tell -PRON- if the trial work out
unbelievable
-PRON- original visit be on february 26th
3 month later
and -PRON- still do_not have -PRON- contact
-PRON- seriously would not recommend_this_place to anyone
never_go_back
if -PRON- contact be not ready by wednesday which be when -PRON- say -PRON- would be ready
-PRON- better believe -PRON- will ask for a bloody refund
-PRON- love the cadillac margarita and the variety_of dish make everyone happy

-PRON- come home to find just the trunk of the tree leave

-PRON- signature sauce be good but not as spectacular as -PRON- imagine
the shishito pepper be good but -PRON- prefer the same dish at windsor
here be the slight downside beyond the slight disappointment with the sauces- the price of drink

fair enough -PRON- guess
let -PRON- just say -PRON- have have way good from the bottom shelf at walmart
the warm bread be nice and fresh but -PRON- wish -PRON- would mix the oil and balsamic in a shallow dish\/plate because -PRON- keep get just oil ruin the lovely bread
sad face -PRON- order the chicken ravioli
kinda mushy and lack in flavor
-PRON- think the pesto sauce be a little too creamy drown out everything_else

tiramisu
-PRON- absolutely_love tiramisu so
-PRON- have to try
-PRON- finally get to the table and look delicious
so pretty and promising
then first_bite
just okay
run theme here
very heavy on the custard and not enough alcohol\/espresso\/ladyfinger lavishness
a much light version than what -PRON- be use to
bae order the creamy limoncello which be interesting as neither of -PRON- have ever have a creamy version so -PRON- would not know_what to compare -PRON- to
at the end of the day -PRON- would probably come_back for happy_hour to try the blood orange cocktail but no rush
this_company be amazing
-PRON- highly_recommend that -PRON- work with -PRON- if -PRON- be look to kayak\/canoe\/anyth in the hoover dam and vegas
-PRON- book a reservation with -PRON- for 55 people for -PRON- university trip and -PRON- handle -PRON- with ease

-PRON- have a great time with the guide
-PRON- can_not speak more highly of these_people -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- will_definitely be back for another trip
-PRON- order the monte cristo $_18
-PRON- be a deconstruct affair feature pork loin and french_toast with a raspberry sauce
all of the ingredient be terrific as be the flavor
the presentation be beautiful and appetizing
the downside be that the french_toast seem to be about half of what the portion should be
there be not enough to match up with the pork
nothing on -PRON- plate be hot
the toast be warm but the pork be cold
-PRON- be also undercook
-PRON- be not suggest that -PRON- serve -PRON- a piece_of leather -PRON- prefer a nice pink medium
what -PRON- do_not want be a pool of blood on -PRON- plate
also the host be a condescending pretentious ass
next week -PRON- will go_back to jack flaps
-PRON- have be to topgolf before and have organize event to have people join before as_well
-PRON- have always have fun and a great experience

while wrap up -PRON- visit -PRON- be -PRON- turn to finish up -PRON- round
-PRON- grab one of -PRON- club place -PRON- ball on the tee and in -PRON- back swing some guy dress in a football jersey yell_at -PRON- and tell -PRON- that -PRON- could_not use a hybrid or a wood
to a bunch_of amateur who rarely golf and most of -PRON- have never be -PRON- be all leave confused with the interaction
without stay around to answer question or clarify -PRON- angrily tell -PRON- to not use -PRON- own club and then leave
-PRON- honestly think -PRON- be from the bay next to -PRON- then realize -PRON- be an_employee
-PRON- be all leave stand there kind_of shocked
nobody have say not to use -PRON- own club
nobody have explain wood hybrid etc
that may seem elementary but to those of -PRON- who do_not golf regularly -PRON- come_across extremely_rude
-PRON- waitress be very apologetic and come over and apologize to -PRON- and the group
the manager come and express similar sentiment
-PRON- be such an odd out of place interaction
overall -PRON- be a great experience but for someone_who be represent such a great company and establishment who be out of uniform to come and belittle criticize and then not try to professionally address the situation -PRON- be very shocking
-PRON- can only hope that -PRON- move_forward without -PRON-
-PRON- go here for lunch with -PRON- boyfriend over the weekend and be quite happy with the food
both of -PRON- order the joey bag of donuts with chicken each and mind -PRON- -PRON- be huge
even heavier if -PRON- add cheese or sour_cream or guac but -PRON- do_not
-PRON- be out of mushroom and for the pepper -PRON- only have green pepper which be weird since -PRON- go on a saturday_afternoon but -PRON- be quite content with -PRON-
-PRON- add the fresh jalapenos should have go with the pickle like -PRON- boyfriend and hot_sauce which be a mistake
after 2 bite -PRON- be pick out all the jalapeno and -PRON- be fine till -PRON- reach the end of -PRON- burrito
from then on -PRON- set -PRON- mouth on fire and -PRON- stomach start to hurt
then -PRON- figure_out -PRON- put -PRON- burrito upright and all the hot_sauce probably trickle down to the bottom thus make the end of -PRON- burrito super hot and fiery
-PRON- be still thankful that -PRON- do get to enjoy the rest_of -PRON- burrito and the sauce do_not ruin all of -PRON-
also the give -PRON- free chip with -PRON- order and -PRON- salsa_bar have some very_nice and flavorful salsa
-PRON- will_definitely go_back and try to pick -PRON- ingredient wisely

komol versus lotus of siam
go to both during -PRON- foodie adventure tour of las_vegas and hand_down the winner by_far be komol
for fresh veggie and a more broad protein and seafood selection komol have -PRON-
interestingly -PRON- go to lotus of siam first but choose not to wait in line for an_hour during peak dinner time due_to have show ticket so -PRON- stumble_upon komol same shopping_center
-PRON- be blow_away_by the soft_shell_crab entree and chicken with green that -PRON- just have to see if lotus be that much good
the next_day -PRON- go to lotus and have nam prik and khao soi -PRON- signature northern thai dish and be not that impressed

the table that -PRON- family and -PRON- sit_at have major leveling problem
-PRON- try to remedy with the sugar pack but to no avail
front of house staff buss table with all finger in glass which be a major germ spread process
-PRON- hope -PRON- have a large budget for hand soap or someone will get sick certainly soon from suck terrible busing habit
-PRON- be give the bill as -PRON- food arrive and then the attentiveness of -PRON- server be miss in action
-PRON- have to get up for coffee refill and napkin
-PRON- have to also flag a another server for a fork
the highlight of the meal be -PRON- wife 's burger which -PRON- love
-PRON- do however fall_apart as -PRON- eat -PRON- but -PRON- be well_season and good quality
the kid like -PRON- mac and cheese and the kid menu with activity be a nice_touch for keep the little one occupy
-PRON- think if toast would readjust -PRON- serve etiquette and busing process to be more in line with proper service standard -PRON- would give -PRON- another try

-PRON- be a big_fan_of babystack pancake
-PRON- think the hazelnut pancak with plenty_of strawberry and whip_cream be generally outstanding
the service here be a+ as_well keep coffee and water cup full at nearly all time
at this point -PRON- may be wonder from whence do this four_star review come
first -PRON- would_rather give a 4.5_star review
second -PRON- admit that -PRON- have be spoil by some outstanding breakfast in -PRON- lifetime
also -PRON- can_not order sweet breakfast every_time -PRON- go out
-PRON- only knock on this_place be that -PRON- savory breakfast while still very very good do_not knock -PRON- sock off
again -PRON- have not have a bad_experience here and -PRON- doubt -PRON- ever will
enjoy -PRON- delicious food and great service
if there be a way to give zero_star -PRON- would
buy a new years eve package for dinner an a vip table in -PRON- club
the staff be in utter confusion about how to process the pre print ticket people have for the event and -PRON- be almost comical
for be a six annual event this be kind_of surprising as -PRON- be manage more like a kindergarten ice_cream social
dinner be not even as good as olive_garden the mcdonalds of italian
most of the dish be cold except the salad which be warm
the server seem lose and -PRON- be hard to believe this be an establish restaurant
on to the vip table" -PRON- be small table set_up in what look_like a basement
-PRON- ask one of the staff where -PRON- table be because -PRON- be all full
-PRON- tell -PRON- to look for people that be not wear red wrist band and tell -PRON- to move
really
-PRON- decide -PRON- would just get -PRON- bottle_of champagne that be part of the package although -PRON- charge -PRON- a fifty dollar gratuity and leave but the bar tender say -PRON- do_not_know any thing_about bottle_of champagne
and -PRON- would have to inquire with someone_else
-PRON- decide just to leave and spend the remainder of the night in the casino bar which be way good service and drink
-PRON- should have save the $ 400 package cost and just go out for a real dinner at a restaurant that have edible food and a competent management team
the vintage be not -PRON- favorite brewery restaurant combo in_madison but that probably say more about this city 's plethora of glorious brewery restaurant hybrid than the vintage
-PRON- use to come_here more_often when -PRON- have trivium frankly -PRON- be not_sure_why -PRON- stop the place be packed for -PRON- on tuesdays
-PRON- can_not give -PRON- a much high score though due_to some snafu that -PRON- have have while dining here
first the good stuff
when everything go accord to plan the staff be friendly welcome and attentive
the beer be excellent and there be almost always special of one sort or another on various drink
hibiscus saison be not often in season or in stock but when -PRON- be -PRON- be a tart fruity glass of deliciousness and quite_possibly -PRON- favorite summer beer
a welcome surprise be -PRON- mixed drink which often fall to the side in brewpub
-PRON- sangria be a personal_favorite
as_far as food go -PRON- be a fan_of the cheese_curd although -PRON- be quite greasy the meatloaf sandwich and the big sky burger
the bathroom be well stocked point for any bathroom that include hand lotion at the sink and clean
now for the less good stuff
first -PRON- will not seat -PRON- party until everyone be there
-PRON- know this be a common practice in most large city but -PRON- be still enough to raise an eyebrow in_madison
second the beautiful outdoor_patio have so_much potential but there be some significant problem
a lot_of place will have some_sort_of mosquito deterrent in the form of citronella candle or torch but that be not the case here -PRON- be eat alive in the five_minute -PRON- be outside
also -PRON- have the misfortune of be seat directly under a pair of speaker with music so loud -PRON- be difficult to have a conversation at time -PRON- even feel physically painful
on this occasion -PRON- companion and -PRON- move indoor due_to these factor make_sure to speak to a server before -PRON- be move indoor
this be where thing begin to unravel
the music be still extremely loud especially consider this be a monday_night and the restaurant have very few people in -PRON-
there be only one other table of diner in -PRON- section and -PRON- would seem that -PRON- move lead to -PRON- be seat in customer purgatory since neither of -PRON- could get a server 's attention the vast majority_of the time
there be one slightly old female server who take pity on -PRON- whenever -PRON- see -PRON- and make_sure -PRON- have what -PRON- need make_sure -PRON- food be taste good etc
however -PRON- do_not think -PRON- be -PRON- section so -PRON- do_not see -PRON- often and would desperately try to flag_down a server sometimes wave -PRON- arm at the server who congregate by the patio door to chat with each_other and who be do a great_job at ignore -PRON-
the noise level in_general be fairly high with practically nothing to dampen -PRON-
there be also some item on -PRON- menu that be ridiculous or bland\/stale
the pretzel appetizer be tough and appalling
the spinach artichoke dip be fairly bland and -PRON- would go much good with baguette slice than the tortilla chip that be serve with -PRON-
the irish nachos be anemic and fairly flavorless
and the grill_cheese cheeseburger which substitute an entire grill_cheese for each half of a burger bun be a foot high impossible to eat revolt in concept and seem_like a transparent ploy to get adam richman to visit
-PRON- will still be back for more hibiscus saison though
mmm beer
have dinner here with the guy before catch -PRON- show at the mgm
venue be awesome and -PRON- be right on the corner at the intersection so the outer table have a cool view of lv blvd
-PRON- each order -PRON- dish and be very_pleased_with -PRON-
price be not_too_bad
-PRON- can get busy on weekend at dinner so reservation may be a good idea
service be acceptable give how busy -PRON- be
-PRON- server have an_awesome back tattoo
-PRON- be confusing and also charge_$ 3 extra just to shorten -PRON- toenail
-PRON- would not recommend this please
-PRON- have stay_at good courtyard marriotts before
the staff be friendly and the food from the bistro really be good but overall the hotel and the location be just eh
-PRON- be minute away_from the chandler fashion center which be great but other_than_that there be nothing else nearby
and the freeway
-PRON- room in particular be a_bit annoying because every door be squeaky
-PRON- want to buy wd40 -PRON-
just -PRON- average 2 or 3_star hotel
-PRON- be very clean though
this be a_few day over due however -PRON- need to actually sing the praise of this_place
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- go last_weekend -PRON- have an_incredible time
-PRON- instructor cooper be super amazing
-PRON- be very nervous consider -PRON- have never fire a gun let_alone some of those rifle
cooper be super informative -PRON- explain to -PRON- what to expect
very patient and calm
plus -PRON- look_like a total bad ass in -PRON- get up
anyway cooper be great -PRON- boyfriend have shoot many gun before and -PRON- walk_away say cooper teach -PRON- a_few thing
-PRON- leave -PRON- feel very comfortable around a gun which be fantastic for a first_timer
the girl at the front be super sweet and helpful
good time guy thank -PRON- so_much
-PRON- have a blast
-PRON- stop here for some hawaiian shave ice and -PRON- end_up buy a water bottle
-PRON- be be a long_time since -PRON- last have some shave ice
but -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- from here
piña colada be the way to go
the syrup be all natural none_of that scary artificial stuff
denise be very_friendly and welcome
-PRON- actually take the time to shave the ice and be not stingy with the flavoring
as -PRON- wait around -PRON- notice the different water bottle from liter to gallon
one catch -PRON- eye of_course perfect size for -PRON- workout day
-PRON- even take the wrapper off rinse and fill -PRON- with ice cold water
and -PRON- can stop in at any time for a 35cent refill
can -PRON- do that anywhere_else
nope
thank denise
-PRON- be a fan_of panera bread in_general
-PRON- be good for an alternative to quiznos or subway
-PRON- seem_like -PRON- be eat a little healthy as_well but -PRON- will not hold -PRON- breathe on whether or not that be actually true
this particular one can get super pack but -PRON- be there today right around lunchtime on a saturday and -PRON- friend
and -PRON- do_not wait at all to get -PRON- order in
-PRON- like that -PRON- have people_who come around and take -PRON- plate from -PRON- table when -PRON- be do
also -PRON- be a huge_fan_of the chip -PRON- serve with -PRON- sandwich
extra crunchy and tasty
-PRON- go to sandwich be the ceasar salad sandwich
and -PRON- always get -PRON- with half the cheese -PRON- normally put on -PRON-
the romaine lettuce always have a snap and the tomato and red_onion be always rockin
overall panera be a good stop for a quick lunch or if -PRON- be hanker for a sammich and -PRON- just want to go for an_old stand by
-PRON- do a great_job here -PRON- have be cut by 4 different people and -PRON- turn_out great
people at work think -PRON- go to a fancy expensive place -PRON- be shocked when -PRON- say supercuts
great value
what be not to love
delicious drink and a really friendly hip wait or be the first thing -PRON- like about this_place
there be lot_of staff around and any be willing_to be helpful by clear -PRON- plate and make_sure -PRON- glass stay full
the bruschetta be literally something -PRON- crave for a week after -PRON- eat there
and as -PRON- type this -PRON- would like to get back
-PRON- try 4 different kind one with butternut squash and pumpkin that -PRON- could_not eat fast enough
-PRON- eat outside and -PRON- be absolutely beautiful but even the inside would have be nice because -PRON- too have a cool atmosphere
last note -PRON- happy_hour be awesome and -PRON- have a_few differ the special during the week as_well
the only_downside of eat_here be that -PRON- may never be able_to go_back to -PRON- regular chinese joint anymore the standard be now set way_too high
-PRON- be rare in_fact probably happen for the first_time ever yesterday where -PRON- eat at 2 restaurant through out the day and both of -PRON- be 5\/5 for -PRON- see -PRON- other_review on terrace pointe cafe
in sum -PRON- be a happy camper
blossom overall 5\/5 ambience 5\/5
very elegant asian\/chinese theme excellent lighting
service 5\/5 top_notch
food go for dinner 5\/5 yum
annoyance factor none -PRON- request that -PRON- food be make a tad spicier and -PRON- could_not have be more perfect
the various chinese sauce the blend and everything be so perfect
the chicken be cook to perfection
favorite dish spicy indian fried rice -PRON- know this sound fairly standard but the way this be make be just outta this_world never have anything like this before
all the waiter be very_friendly and accommodate
-PRON- use yelp soooo much that -PRON- have to write about this
-PRON- go on a thursday eve early
-PRON- be not busy at all
-PRON- order margherita pizza and wet pizza
take along time have to ask for tea and lemon
once the pizza be bring to -PRON- table -PRON- be luke war and look as if -PRON- be sit awhile
-PRON- would think that a 900 degree oven would produce very hot pizza
well that be not the case
kind_of disappointed to horrible just bad
could have be so_much good
soooo as to all the fellow_yelper if -PRON- go
-PRON- hope -PRON- experience be good
-PRON- will not be go again
35 dollar too
very expensive
potion size be fantastic.kind service calamari fry be good as appetizer
pad tai be also good
but i feel ketchup taste
do_not add ketchup in pad_thai
-PRON- can enjoy thai beer too
really really good food top off with really really good shake and the good service at a fast_food restaurant -PRON- will ever see
be to this restaurant twice
like the taste of the dish and the lunch menu a lot
decide to invite friend there for dinner
the happy_hour be fabulous the food be great but
-PRON- will not return unless -PRON- take_care_of -PRON- fly problem
because of the outdoor sitting the door have to be open frequently and the fly evidently come through there
-PRON- be land on the food the drink the glass on -PRON- face
to say -PRON- be unpleasant be an understatement
for any restaurant especially the one like bink 's -PRON- be unacceptable and pretty gross
that be why -PRON- rat -PRON- as 3star
please take_care_of this awful problem so people can enjoy -PRON- food and restaurant
-PRON- can_not believe -PRON- be give a starbucks a 1_star review
that_being_say -PRON- stop in at this starbucks after a meeting with -PRON- photographer for -PRON- wedding and before -PRON- have to be at work
-PRON- be convenient for -PRON- and in the area
there be a drive_thru but because -PRON- have plenty_of time before -PRON- have to be at work
-PRON- figure -PRON- would just go in
the place be full of people but there be some free seat
-PRON- walk right up and put in -PRON- order
mocha ice non fat no whip
doo doo doo
so -PRON- figure -PRON- will go sit_down at a table and wait
surely -PRON- will hear -PRON- call -PRON- drink
nope
not once do -PRON- hear -PRON- drink call
nope
didn't call my drink
so -PRON- walk up to the bar mind -PRON- -PRON- be really only be about 4 minute but there be only 2 people_who order after -PRON- and -PRON- see -PRON- drink just eff sit there
as -PRON- see -PRON- the barista start to take -PRON- away and give -PRON-
this wtf do -PRON- want
look
and then -PRON- snottily say be -PRON- wait for a drink
and -PRON- say yes
and -PRON- say well -PRON- have be call this one out for awhile
yea
cuz
-PRON- totally didn't
hear
you call my drink in the quiet small area
we're all in right_now
what a little bitch
nice quaint little shop
not the bustle of the major chain which be always a plus
-PRON- get the carolina house blend coffee
so -PRON- can_not speak for any of the specialty
nice and full good flavor
drive_thru plenty_of seating comfy lounge chair in the front book and newspaper for reading blue bell ice_cream and all the baked good look appealing
-PRON- will_definitely stop in again when in the area
-PRON- have wait for a great local breakfast\/brunch place to open in this area and this_place definitely hit the spot
the service be great
whatev -PRON- want -PRON- will try -PRON- good to provide
-PRON- have be to 2 of -PRON- other location and the food be always great
-PRON- food meet that standard as_well
the reason this_location do_not get five_star be solely because as of today 5\/22\/16 -PRON- do_not have -PRON- liquor license yet in result -PRON- could_not have a mimosa with -PRON- food
really disappointing since -PRON- have be open for month now
aside_from that this_place be a-1
the staff need a lesson on what any social medium mean
-PRON- do_not mean just facebook
-PRON- mention this because there be a post sign by where -PRON- order a burrito in which any social medium check in give a free elote
-PRON- luckily have facebook but -PRON- girlfriend disable -PRON- awhile back and when -PRON- show -PRON- yelp check in nearly everyone in the kitchen be yell
facebook only
the young cashier understand the clearly mark sign and offer to deliver 2 rightfully earn elote to -PRON- table
-PRON- guess the cashier forget so -PRON- ask -PRON- about -PRON- corn which -PRON- say -PRON- would bring right out after apologize to -PRON-
-PRON- overheard the kitchen staff loudly ask -PRON- in spanish why two elote be be give to -PRON-
sigh -PRON- each get an elote in the end thank to the cashier 's diligence and reading comprehension
another thing the price of burrito have go up
-PRON- usual order of 2 burrito use to be $_16 something and
now -PRON- be $ 19 and some change
-PRON- will be look elsewhere for mexican_food when -PRON- be back in_vegas
-PRON- come for revolution group training and end_up get an individually personalize workout
usually group class involve everyone do the same_thing at the same time but not this one
though there be two of -PRON- gerald tailor make each of -PRON- workout to make_sure -PRON- be be challenge
very straightforward and easy to follow
from the beginning everyone at the gym be welcome
-PRON- give a tour and make_sure -PRON- know_what to expect
-PRON- even comp -PRON- a bottle_of water during -PRON- workout for be new and probably because -PRON- look_like -PRON- be about to die
great workout friendly people and finally a place close to -PRON- house
love_this_place
the staff be great the drink be interesting and really good
and the good part be the burger
one of the good place for really good burger
some may argue but if -PRON- be look for a meaty patty with lot_of interesting topping this be the place
oh and the price be very_reasonable for what -PRON- be get
so -PRON- have never in -PRON- life take anything for grant like cbw
-PRON- recently_move to florida and there be no cbw around -PRON-
-PRON- should have rat this_place year_ago
-PRON- dog would pull -PRON- like a human kite from the car to the entry gate
everytime -PRON- pull in there
case in point this_place be gold
fyi -PRON- have see a small scab here or there from other dog or maybe even the sibling lol when -PRON- get home however that be what dog do
-PRON- never ever feel_like -PRON- could_not completely trust the staff here
if -PRON- could rate this 6 star -PRON- sure would
not a very good place to go if -PRON- be in a wheelchair try to get in the restaurant be a challenge once inside -PRON- be show to a table with four chair and the waiter walk_away leave -PRON- to move the furniture around so -PRON- could get the wheelchair to the table
when the waiter arrive back to take -PRON- order -PRON- request the artichoke dip as_an_appetizer about four minute past when the waiter inform -PRON- the dip be not available as -PRON- do_not have the ingredient
-PRON- then order the egg plant straw which be kind_of a mistake as -PRON- where only half cook oily and stodgy
for -PRON- main meal -PRON- order the chicken marsala which the menu describe as serve with crispy potato blister asparagus and mushroom in a marsala sauce the crispy potato be far_from crispy and be well overcook the asparagus be so hard -PRON- could_not be consume and there be no mushroom
the marsala sauce taste_like just a brown gravy pour over two piece_of what taste_like chicken
-PRON- companion order the pork_chop with sweet_potato_fry
the pork be not cook near the large bone and overcook in other place which make -PRON- tough and -PRON- be cover in some kind_of brown liquid could_not tell what -PRON- be the sweet_potato_fry serve in a paper container should have be leave in the kitchen
and now the good news the desert the maple bread_pudding with ice creme be to die for
this be -PRON- first_visit to this restaurant and i do_not think -PRON- will return
visited december 2016
this be one of the cool museum -PRON- have ever be to
first_off -PRON- a pretty modern building which be fun to look_at and very easy to get to by train
inside be a lot_of fun -PRON- buy -PRON- ticket and take an escalator to the top
and then -PRON- start work -PRON- way around there be also an audio tour available if -PRON- want but the description of the car be in both german and english
-PRON- have every kind_of car plus a_few other thing
lot_of race vintage prototype and other car be there to be see -PRON- even have other brand car that be design together by porsche
the gift_shop have model of a good majority_of the car if -PRON- want to take one home
overall -PRON- would_recommend this museum for anyone_who like to see anything that go fast
the beef brisket be incredible tender fall_apart and taste even better with the bbq_sauce
the cornbread be delicious and good cheesy mac and cheese ever
great service friendly_staff and clean restroom
-PRON- want good bbq
this be the place to eat especially after that long drive from the grand canyon and -PRON- be conveniently_locate less_than a mile from the freeway
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- decide that last sunday_afternoon -PRON- would venture downtown to get brunch at park on fremont
-PRON- be meet with some of the bad service -PRON- have ever experience as a guest at any establishment
-PRON- be seat outside on -PRON- patio just before noon
-PRON- table be slightly sunny which be not a problem for -PRON- in the beginning
-PRON- server andrea come over and -PRON- order a patio pounder which be an entire bottle_of champagne and a craft of oj for $_20 -PRON- boyfriend also order a coffee
-PRON- be stoke
after a very short time the sun have move and leave -PRON- table in direct sunlight
the both of -PRON- start to get very hot and uncomfortable
when -PRON- server come over to -PRON- again to drop_off -PRON- drink -PRON- explain -PRON- discomfort and ask to be move to a shady table that have just open up
-PRON- say yes of_course and happily move -PRON- to the more comfortable table and take -PRON- food order
not five_minute later the host come up and plainly say -PRON- can_not stay_here this table be be save and when -PRON- express that -PRON- have just become too hot at -PRON- original one
all -PRON- say in reply be oh and walk_away
the attitude -PRON- receive be unnecessary
-PRON- have not move table on -PRON- own -PRON- ask -PRON- server who have no_problem move -PRON-
all -PRON- want be to sit_at a table where -PRON- could comfortably enjoy -PRON- brunch
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- be an outrageous request
after embarrassingly move back to -PRON- original sunny table -PRON- receive -PRON- food
-PRON- order french_toast and -PRON- boyfriend get the breakfast skillet
-PRON- food be great
let -PRON- repeat that our food be great
this may have be some of the good french_toast -PRON- have ever have
but after -PRON- receive -PRON- food -PRON- server andrea be nowhere to be find
throughout the rest_of -PRON- meal -PRON- come to -PRON- table only twice
once right after -PRON- receive -PRON- food obviously due_to the two bite rule and once more in pass to ask if -PRON- boyfriend need more coffee after -PRON- be almost finish with -PRON- meal
-PRON- do_not even drop_off -PRON- check -PRON-
-PRON- would not have be so upset by this if -PRON- have not hear -PRON- chat excitedly with the table next to -PRON-
-PRON- can only assume that -PRON- terrible attitude be due_to -PRON- assume -PRON- would not receive a tip from -PRON- after -PRON- be tell not ask tell to move table
-PRON- do_not_know_what exactly the staff here at park on fremont think customer_service be
but -PRON- be definitely not treat -PRON- guest like -PRON- be an inconvenience or not worth -PRON- time and attention
-PRON- will not be return to park on fremont until -PRON- hear that the staff have have a makeover
the food be amazing but not good enough to make -PRON- want to have a horrible experience like that ever again
-PRON- husband take -PRON- car in for a simple oil_change because later that day -PRON- be leave out of state to attend a funeral at the end -PRON- almost cost -PRON- a new engine
not even half way to -PRON- destination -PRON- car oil indicator come on
dang
what be the issue -PRON- have just change -PRON- oil
apparently there be a leak because during the oil_change service the part be not replace tightly therefore cause the oil to leak out
-PRON- end_up pay for another oil_change and for towing services
then the next_day i call jiffy lube and explain what_happen to the store manager that because of -PRON- neglect -PRON- engine be almost ruin -PRON- have to pay for another oil_change and the cost tow the car to the near toyota for service
-PRON- be hesitant to negotiate any deal with -PRON-
the call end when -PRON- become frustrated and hang_up_on -PRON-
this be ridiculous
-PRON- will_never go_back to jiffy again please stay_away_from this_place for the safety of you and your car
unless you want poor service
amazing
this be cigar and pipe paradise
the selection be incredible humidor pipe and pipe tobacco ashtray lighter and so_many cigar -PRON- boggle the mind
-PRON- walk_in humidor be the large -PRON- have ever see easily the size of some entire store
-PRON- have be in twice_now
the first_time the service be adequate but the guy run the show be talk to some other customer so -PRON- could_not judge the friendliness
tonight be great
-PRON- take lot_of time to answer -PRON- question show -PRON- -PRON- merchandise and just generally chit chat
other have already mention the great smoking lounge
unfortunately membership cost $ 600 a year which be a little out of -PRON- price_range right_now
-PRON- do_not see the barware that another_reviewer mention
-PRON- ask and -PRON- say -PRON- have never carry anything like that
so -PRON- wonder_if -PRON- be think of -PRON- other location
anyway -PRON- agree with -PRON- that this be definitely a guy place
tasty shawarma in a convenient location across the street from broadview station
the meat be shave off the spit and grill to form a_bit of texture when -PRON- bite_into the sandwich
tasty and warm
-PRON- have the regular shawarma topping lettuce onion garlic toum pickle beet cabbage
tomato hot pepper tabouleh i think this be extra though
tahini and hot_sauce optional
-PRON- recommend -PRON- do -PRON- up
have the sandwich as -PRON- be intend
the pita be then put on the grill press to toast the pita up a_bit
the sandwich be a good portion- -PRON- fill -PRON- up
-PRON- be decently_price not the cheap but not the most_expensive
-PRON- think -PRON- be between 6 7 for sandwich and drink
-PRON- be also a huge_fan_of the fish
-PRON- be light but definitely pack flavour
-PRON- do get a_bit soggy at the end of the sandwich though
so maybe ask -PRON- to make_sure to not go so heavy on the sauce
-PRON- have see people get the plate and -PRON- pile on the food
-PRON- have daily specials-
so falafel day -PRON- find be the most popular
the guy work there be friendly but not exactly the most efficient service can be slow
great bar
the bartender be awesome
tori be one of the good
never have to wait for a drink
price be reasonable
-PRON- can always make a friend at cheers
ok this be not the kind_of place -PRON- typically enjoy but -PRON- tuesday_night trivium be a pretty_good time
team compete for free the emcee be funny and knowledgeable without be too annoying or intrusive and the question can be challenging
-PRON- have decent drink special but be sure to grab a bite elsewhere before arrive at jupiter 's
the crab_dip be meh and the pizza look greasy and cold
the wide open second level have pool_table a huge patio a bar and comfy seating
there be also a stage for who know_what dj karaoke dancing male stripper
not really sure
the main level be mostly video and arcade game with ton_of kid run_around
not really -PRON- thing but -PRON- all seem to be have a good time
-PRON- realize -PRON- be silly to complain_about a bar that be brightly light when the reason for be there be to play trivium but -PRON- think the ambiance could improve if -PRON- would turn down the light just a tad
-PRON- be go to rate jupiter 's with only 2_star but -PRON- server be very sweet and attentive and all the trivium team be have a great time
yeah -PRON- will be back for trivium again but -PRON- be definitely not a place for hang_out with friend
go last month with a friend
the vibe be very cool in a bohemian urban collegiate east village kinda way for madison
-PRON- be pleasantly_surprised
service be good and fast
the food mango curry fresh roll and soup be soooo good
-PRON- just want to smack -PRON- mama
no seriously -PRON- be spice just right and very fresh
-PRON- care_about the food -PRON- serve
highly_recommend
not a first date kinda place
this be a solid gym -PRON- do_not see why people would give -PRON- anything less_than 4_star
this_place have everything from in door pool in door track separate room for free weight and machine galore
some people complain_about over crowd but if a machine -PRON- want be use then use the next one and come_back or run_around the in door track
overall -PRON- be a good gym only_thing -PRON- do_not like be food be cook and serve inside the gym
-PRON- really do_not want to smell food cooking when -PRON- be work out
1_star for that
other_than_that service be decent
but -PRON- be there to work out not chit chat
so that do_not really matter to -PRON-
-PRON- take 3 people in -PRON- all receive deluxe pedicure
-PRON- be seat_immediately even_tho -PRON- be 15_min early have very good service throughout
thank -PRON- particularly to kim who tend_to -PRON-
will_definitely_return
sorry that -PRON- work at a busy airport
sorry -PRON- be sunday_morning
and -PRON- would_rather be at home
hey get to do what -PRON- get to do
suck -PRON- up
the one thing -PRON- have to always remember be customer first
be friendly
put on a happy face even when -PRON- do_not want to
that be the name of the game no_matter_what -PRON- job be
step -PRON- up guy
southwest 's reputation carry -PRON- to 2_star
horrible service from everyone especially the people in sale
the only nice one -PRON- have encounter be herbert from abc store and silvia from front_desk
girl that work at tour have attitude and do_not want to make customer happy at all
do_not the hotel want people to have a good stay and think about get a time share
if that be the plan -PRON- be fail at -PRON- horribly
ace try to help -PRON- out with -PRON- problem but -PRON- could_not
-PRON- do appreciate -PRON- but the other girl behind the counter could_not careless about -PRON- situation at all
which be pretty sad when -PRON- come to customer_service
first -PRON- get here
-PRON- have problem with -PRON- registration and this girl name elizabeth be horrible
-PRON- have such an angry\/careless face on which give -PRON- a bad first_impression about this hotel and resort
-PRON- look_like -PRON- do_not want to be there at all
and when -PRON- come to -PRON- with -PRON- problem -PRON- do_not want to help -PRON- and try to make -PRON- call a 1 800 number
-PRON- mean come on
really
-PRON- be at the hotel and who else can fix -PRON- problem with registration
-PRON- just wish the resort could have handle out situation differently and try to understand where -PRON- be come from
-PRON- be sure there be plenty_of friendly_staff here
but -PRON- would like to see those staff on the front line and not the people that deserve to be behind the scene where no one can see or hear -PRON-
this_place use to be pretty_good but -PRON- seriously suck now
-PRON- use to go once a week to get -PRON- car clean and always get the vip wash
-PRON- do half ass job and always forget to vacuum -PRON- center console even after be remind to do so before -PRON- even hand over -PRON- key
-PRON- will half dry -PRON- vehicle as_well
-PRON- could keep go on and on about this_place
-PRON- do_not recommend go here
-PRON- will_never go_back here
the bacchanal be the buffet at caesars palace
-PRON- be one of the high_end buffet on the strip and -PRON- put -PRON- in the same category as the buffet at the wynn bellagio and aria
-PRON- be not cheap and run in the $_50 something range per_person but -PRON- be pretty_good
when -PRON- first walk_in -PRON- will notice the seafood section
this be the highlight of this buffet
-PRON- come at the end of brunch so -PRON- be able_to see both brunch and dinner
for the brunch seafood selection -PRON- have a_few variety_of crab_leg and claws
-PRON- have smoke oyster which be full of flavor
-PRON- have a creamy mussel dish that be also great
-PRON- have a variety_of other less option that -PRON- do_not mess with
for the dinner seafood selection -PRON- bring_out the pacific oyster
these oyster be huge but not -PRON- favorite flavor wise
-PRON- also bring_out a mixed selection of snow and alaskan king_crab on a share bed of ice
these be alright but kind_of bland
-PRON- have oyster shooter which be of the non alcohol variety and consist_of a raw oyster in a shot of thick bloody_mary mix
-PRON- try one
but -PRON- be not -PRON- favorite
the oyster shooter should be do with vodka and splash of tabasco only
-PRON- also have sea snail
-PRON- be in the adventurous mood so -PRON- have a_few
not bad similar to a big chewy bite of clam meat
seafood station get a 5 out of 5
the next highlighted area of this buffet would be -PRON- meat\/carv station setup
a various selection of large chunk of meat and sausage where -PRON- ask for say meat
and -PRON- slice -PRON- off a piece
this selection do_not change between brunch and dinner
-PRON- be not too impressed
-PRON- have tri tip prime_rib american waygu beef
-PRON- ask for the rare cut of the selection and the carver recommend the tri tip
-PRON- be alright a little tough but ok
not too_far from the carving station -PRON- have a bone_marrow dish which consist_of a half section of bone fill with marrow and top with some shredded_beef
never try the whole marrow slurp thing but give -PRON- a try and -PRON- be alright
the marrow be like a tender piece_of fat with a very delicate consistency
-PRON- also have a lamb dish -PRON- try but the meat be tough
overall -PRON- would give the carve station\/meat area a 3 out of 5
the third area hide in the back corner of the buffet be the sushi\/dim sum area
the sushi be very average
the dim_sum also likewise
for dim_sum -PRON- go with the shiu mai the shrimp dumpling in the translucent wrapper
typically this be one of -PRON- favorite but these be very bland and blanch
seafood\/dim sum section get a 3 out of 5
there be many_other section mexican salad_bar and most of the other section -PRON- would expect to find a buffet
-PRON- do_not partake into these area
so -PRON- could_not tell -PRON- too_much
nothing really catch -PRON- eye there
to wrap up the meal -PRON- go for dessert and the bacchanal dessert section be impressive
a large variety_of self_serve sized_portion of most of anything -PRON- could think of
-PRON- have carrot_cake flan creme_brulee a gelato station and countless other option
high_quality stuff
this section be do very well
dessert section get a 5 for 5
if -PRON- want to spend a_little_bit of change the bacchanal make for a fulfil lunch or dinner
holy_crap this_place live_up to the hype
arguably the good restaurant experience -PRON- have in_madison
-PRON- do_not even need to wait for a table
and on memorial day weekend
the environment be a little loud but super_cute and modern with lot_of natural light
-PRON- get ice_coffee which be not cold brew but be high_quality coffee -PRON- would not have know the difference
but -PRON- boyfriend be a coffee connoisseur
the pancake be light and fluffy and have a uniquely delicious flavor -PRON- can_not put -PRON- finger on
-PRON- have_no_idea what -PRON- do to -PRON-
but wow
the breakfast potato be some of the good -PRON- have have anywhere
-PRON- boo have the breakfast_burrito and report that -PRON- be above_average
do -PRON- a favor and come_here
this spot be sleek fun and vibrant
the decor be amazing -PRON- look_like an upscale boutique\/bar
the location be right uptown -PRON- can sit_outside and see the sitting while -PRON- eat
the good picture for instagram of_course
so -PRON- go for sunday_brunch
-PRON- have the chicken and waffle
-PRON- know_what -PRON- be think -PRON- have have one chicken and waffle -PRON- have have -PRON- all
but do all -PRON- chicken and waffle come with a $_2 mimosa
yes that be only during brunch
and be -PRON- surround_by beautiful chandelier the late tune from the radio and a centric type vibe
-PRON- think not
this_place be hand_down one of -PRON- new_favorite brunch spot

thank -PRON- so_much christian
maggie
usually have a good experience here but tonight be terrible
the service be not as good as_usual
-PRON- bring -PRON- the wrong food in the beginning
then when -PRON- food come -PRON- be not good at all first -PRON- order pizza burger w fry and -PRON- be nasty
so -PRON- order pretzel bite because -PRON- remember -PRON- be good but those come_out bad as_well
not_sure if -PRON- have change a lot
but -PRON- would not want to go_back after tonight
love -PRON-
very_personable
felt like -PRON- know -PRON- for year
-PRON- talk and get along great
make for a very comfortable photo shoot
picture be perfect
-PRON- capture our love perfectly
now if -PRON- could just get -PRON- to visit the north bay to do -PRON- newborn photo shoot
finally close -PRON- door
let -PRON- hope -PRON- never open again
place be run like a disco good riddance
barely ok for underground music supporter like -PRON-
fuck -PRON-
sadly -PRON- hafta rate this hole
so -PRON- will give -PRON- a one
but -PRON- do_not really mean -PRON-
-PRON- call jim meyers plumb to fix -PRON- 3 handle american standard hot\/ cold faucet handle in -PRON- bathroom tub
the faucet handle rotate 360 degree and the water only shutoff when the handle be in the horizontal position
additionally the transfer valve be leak from the middle shower handle
the first plumber that be send to repair the faucet could_not fix this issue
-PRON- solution be to adjust the hot\/cold handle vertically downward so -PRON- be easy to position the handle in an off position
-PRON- still rotate 360 degree
-PRON- could_not remove the center shower handle because -PRON- do_not bring allen wrench fortunately -PRON- have -PRON-
once the handle be remove -PRON- indicate -PRON- do_not have the transfer valve to make the repair
-PRON- need this repair complete within 3 day so -PRON- ask if -PRON- have this part at the shop
-PRON- say -PRON- do_not although -PRON- would check with the owner
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could just order the part and have -PRON- overnight
-PRON- say -PRON- would take 3 5 day to get the part and -PRON- would be quick if -PRON- order -PRON-
-PRON- say once the part be in -PRON- would take a 1\/2_hour to install
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could remove the transfer valve so -PRON- could take -PRON- home depot or a plumbing supply store to get a replacement
-PRON- say -PRON- do_not have the tool to remove
-PRON- do convey to the dispatch staff that -PRON- have an american standard faucet when -PRON- initially make the service call
-PRON- prepare the bill for 2_hour at $ 199.85
since -PRON- do_not hear back from the plumber regard the transfer valve -PRON- order -PRON- from amazon
plumber ii be prepare
-PRON- fix the issue with the faucet so -PRON- actually stop and do_not rotate 360 degree
for the center shower handle valve the part -PRON- order from amazon be strip however the plumber do have the part on -PRON- truck and -PRON- quickly repair -PRON-
plumber ii be very_nice and say -PRON- would talk to the owner regard the work of plumber 1 -PRON- agree with -PRON- that the work be subpar
-PRON- say the owner would make thing right
charge for the second service $ 233.05
-PRON- do_not receive a call from the owner so -PRON- call twice
subsequently the owner 's wife call to discuss
after go over the work perform -PRON- say -PRON- do_not feel the charge be right since the first plumber really do_not do anything other_than remove the center shower handle -PRON- be strip -PRON- sawzall -PRON- off
-PRON- first state that -PRON- could_not provide a refund for the work perform because -PRON- have to charge for the time spend try to repair the issue
-PRON- ask -PRON- if charge_$ 432 be fair
after further discussion -PRON- say -PRON- would refund one of the travel charge_$ 34.95 and that be the good -PRON- could do
-PRON- call a plumber for this simple repair because -PRON- want the job to be perform correctly this be a rental property and do_not want further issue
in hindsight -PRON- should have call a handyman -PRON- probably would have at_least bring tool live and learn -PRON- guess
-PRON- be shocked
-PRON- never review this yardhouse as -PRON- must have find -PRON- sit here once a week
-PRON- visit las_vegas this_past_weekend and this_location be just as awesome as -PRON- recall
hand_down the good yardhouse -PRON- have be to
the food quality be consistent
there be plenty_of vegetarian menu_item prepare with gardein 's meat substitute
the thai chicken salad be delicious as be the chicken\/mushroom macaroni and cheese firecracker wing and buffalo chicken pizza

the small_plate be affordable sharing option the flatbread devil egg and ceviche be -PRON- choice
obviously -PRON- eat_here a lot
and the beer
plenty_of delicious brews on_tap

so -PRON- be only natural

the service here have always be 5_star for the 5 and a half year -PRON- live here and even during -PRON- last_visit
the wait may look horrific but -PRON- have never wait long than 30_minute on a saturday_night and the staff be super_friendly and very good at what -PRON- do

then -PRON- tell -PRON- something that mean a lot to a true bbq aficionado -PRON- serve the smoke_meat here without sauce
ever wonder_why most place serve q drown in sauce
-PRON- because -PRON- be hide the fact_that -PRON- can_not smoke good q
not here sns serve some kick ass q and -PRON- do_not cover everything in sauce because -PRON- let the flavor of the meat and smoke shine
-PRON- order the three meat combo with one side

brisket have a wonderful pink smoke ring and be cook_perfectly
pull_pork be so tender and buttery like pork heaven

very cool
-PRON- could see this be a great default spot for a young adult professional crowd
especially if -PRON- live nearby
definitely check -PRON- out
the orleans hotel be a great place to hold a high_school reunion
everything be great except the lighting in the room and most_important there be not a magnify mirror in the bathroom

finally -PRON- find a barber that can cut a flattop
do a great_job
no stray long hair around the ear just a really good cut
this_place be really good

-PRON- be really good -PRON- leave the salon with victoria secret bouncy hair
$_200 for 2 people -PRON- pay to skip the line and still have a long_wait
the drink do_not come_out until -PRON- be finish eat -PRON- first plate

the staff be friendly but unfortunately -PRON- do_not get -PRON- monie worth
show_up on time and be really friendly and courteous
definitely would use again
excellent work
honestly affordable easy to work with and communicative
would_definitely_recommend
this be an_awesome authentic_mexican style restaurant
-PRON- allow room for a sit_down or -PRON- can take -PRON- to go
open_kitchen
quick service
drive_by -PRON- -PRON- would never think anything of -PRON-
great price definitely a must_try
this be one of -PRON- mainstay spot when the sun be out and -PRON- want to feel_like -PRON- have go out on the town off -PRON- go to mon ami gabi
-PRON- really be a combination of the ambiance and the food how can -PRON- go_wrong when -PRON- be sit_outside enjoy french food face with the spectacular performance of the bellagio fountain top with the shockingly in -PRON- face exposure of the good people_watch in_las_vegas
-PRON- love -PRON-
have work in the fashion business for year largely base in new_york -PRON- be thoroughly convinced that the true pleasure of vegas demand that every man and woman dig deep into -PRON- closet and find that outfit that scream take -PRON- to vegas choose completely for -PRON- entertainment
keep in mind -PRON- choose to go at a busy time and want to sit_outside as half the world do in the nice weather -PRON- need to strategically pick that off moment or -PRON- will have a long_wait
everyone want to sit_outside
ok now let address the food -PRON- be excellent for the most_part
-PRON- always seem to order the steak and frites classic and -PRON- be delicious however -PRON- only pet peeve which -PRON- always forget to mention be that when -PRON- ask for the sauce on the side -PRON- bring -PRON- near frozen
-PRON- never get that -PRON- think the obvious thing would be to serve -PRON- slightly heated rather then chill
well -PRON- never_fail to do -PRON-
and if -PRON- can_not get -PRON- duck in order to remember to point that out
by the way the muscle be to die for
-PRON- also recommend that -PRON- sign_up for -PRON- reward program to earn point
-PRON- be worth -PRON- as -PRON- be just there the other day
and -PRON- have a $ 40.00 credit nice perk
-PRON- buy -PRON- wine
-PRON- have always have great table service with interesting waiters\/waitress and the busser 's be on -PRON-
but -PRON- be a hit miss with the hostess stand
-PRON- have this frustration with those hold the first position who can_not look -PRON- in the eye and giggle between each_other
-PRON- experience have often start with an unpleasant and often somewhat confused hostess
unlike a tourist -PRON- be a sure thing as -PRON- know_what be behind the door but if -PRON- be a visitor there be many occasion where -PRON- would simply pass on the wait due_to the rude impersonal interaction with the host
front_desk aside -PRON- be a fantastic spot and great food
so -PRON- call_ahead before -PRON- even go into the store
-PRON- have be look for a very specific movie series that not a lot_of place carry
so the guy that answer the phone be very_helpful and informative about what -PRON- may or may not have
-PRON- kindly place -PRON- on hold so that -PRON- could go look -PRON- up
after about two minute -PRON- come_back on the line to give -PRON- good news that -PRON- have -PRON-
-PRON- immediately drive over to go pick -PRON- up and -PRON- be very_helpful in expedite that situation and give great customer_service
-PRON- also be talk to -PRON- about possible option to join -PRON- vip club for discount
-PRON- also come to find that this store not only have some new and pre own dvds\/cds\/etc but -PRON- buy thing from people when -PRON- no_longer want something -PRON- own

from french spanish american there be something for everyone
starters
tapas from spain grill octopus with potato
white onion truffle soup
-PRON- definitely_recommend this arugula salad way_too_salty and very plain
bread basket -PRON- charge_$ 1.25 for two piece_of bread good but not worth the charge
-PRON- feel_like bread should be free especially at a fancy place like this
entrée
roasted chicken a_bit salty
braised short_rib with mash_potato so tender and juicy dessert
since -PRON- be -PRON- birthday the server be nice enough to give -PRON- a complementary cupcake that be a nice_touch
pistachio\/ coffee creme_brûlée good finish to whole_experience not_overly sweet drinks specialty cocktail some type_of mijito and a cosmo
overall food be good chicken and salad be salty but honestly that be the only_thing -PRON- could complain_about
service be good
-PRON- could have be a_bit_more attentive
take_awhile to get -PRON- drink
there be so_many fancy upscale restaurant in_vegas

the burger -PRON- have be the chipotle burger
the pattie be cook just right

go_back be a possibility for -PRON-

the southwest airlines wing at mccarron suck for one single reason

day and time of incident sunday april 6 2014 10:40am
-PRON- will make -PRON- brief order food 20_minute_later still no food
hungry want to get on the road asap
decide instead_of argue for food to get refund and head across the street to
in n_out
should of be first choice shoot -PRON- own foot
sigh not exactly sure who be at fault here whether management or employee
apparently this female employee do_not have the competence to add up -PRON- order and refund -PRON- money
maybe if -PRON- be a teenager that would of be excusable
as -PRON- be push button on the monitor and look back and forth at -PRON- receipt -PRON- start twitch and look_like the monitor be a tick time bomb from how fast -PRON- be go try to disable -PRON- from blow -PRON- into smithereen
after a_few unfortunate attempt and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund -PRON- jump panic start speak gibberish and then turn_around and leave to the back of the kitchen
extremely disrespectful leave -PRON- there and would say unprofessional of -PRON-
but then again not_sure if -PRON- just assume
g.e.d or high_school diploma even cover that term
which then point to management and the kind_of training -PRON- provide to -PRON- employee
poor lady sure do feel sorry for -PRON-
supervisor give -PRON- -PRON- refund eat a delicious burger from in n_out drive back to california
customer_service = zero_star
word of wisdom stay in school kids and get good grades
classy place
-PRON- do_not smoke
but -PRON- still like the place
-PRON- do_not like the bartender-
-PRON- be not attentive(maybe tired
-PRON- think place be worth of visit
-PRON- like the interior and music
good place to chill
i have not be to many vegan raw place
-PRON- be extremely thoughtful and creative
the food be tasty but -PRON- be so salty i could_not finish -PRON-
maybe -PRON- good on a good day eeekk
the only_reason -PRON- be give olive_garden a star be because of -PRON- salad and breadstick
-PRON- honestly do_not_know_how -PRON- can charge so_much for crappy pasta and subpar meat
-PRON- use to be ok but over the past_few_year portion have get small and price go up
-PRON- will not be return unless there be an improvement
come_here often service often slow
today be the bad
5 people work no one even try to keep line move
everyone move in slow motion
almost_every bagel go at 8:30
coffee empty
just awful
-PRON- have to say this be amazing pizza
the staff have be so nice every_time -PRON- order as_well
-PRON- be pretty picky and feel this be one of three place -PRON- will only order from
perfect
not the typical type_of mexican_food that -PRON- go for but -PRON- be good more of a commercial mexican than -PRON- generally like but the great staff have always be consistent along_with the food which be what make -PRON- fall in the four_star rating
consistent and yummy
-PRON- quite enjoy the pork bone soup and
-PRON- like that -PRON- let -PRON- do a combo option with a small soup and small_portion of meat
get to try the good of both world
the banchan here be delicious and there be plenty_of option
-PRON- be never a fan_of -PRON- kimchi though
and -PRON- really love kimchi usually
the staff be friendly and the place be quite clean
-PRON- would keep come_back
-PRON- be a big_fan_of the new aa
the service be square away
-PRON- last few experience with other airline have be subpar
-PRON- do -PRON- good now to choose american
burrito be not as clean as other restaurant
do_not feel good after eat have a lot_of salt
sorry to rate -PRON- low but -PRON- drive_thru be so slow omg

formally train chef show in the food offer and the great flavor when eat
so_many choice
love_this_place
must admit -PRON- be surprised
expect bar food
but -PRON- be so_much more
the greek custard pastry for dessert be to die for
exceptional attention by the server
umm
this_place
-PRON- can_not knock the good as be really quite good
a_bit over do on presentation which -PRON- certainly charge for
the izikaya style of restaurant be indeed small_plate for share which -PRON- live
baku have join izikaya with fine_dining
in -PRON- opinion this do_not work
suppose to be inexpensive and
pub type atmosphere which baku be neither
the waiter be well train and well informed but this do_not help the sell
-PRON- do_not help -PRON- organize the order very well
ok ok
in short
great food pretentious attitude and over the top setting
may suit some
but if -PRON- be go to pay for and wish to have fine_dining
-PRON- will do just that not try for the casual sharing experience of izikaya in a pompous setting
good be great but will not return
sorry
unless -PRON- lighten up
let -PRON- know
best
sc
-PRON- go to this restaurant during -PRON- sod opening and the view be absolutely_amazing sit on the lake but the food be just so so
the waiter be very_nice but the extremely slow service be also a turn_off because -PRON- keep receive -PRON- food cold
this restaurant be set_up with course and -PRON- have 5 if -PRON- remember correctly
-PRON- totally forget -PRON- 3rd and 4th course and try to give -PRON- dessert after -PRON- spend almost an_hour wait from the 2nd course
maybe one day -PRON- can give itg another shot and -PRON- can update this review with a good one
love the decor and the girl a.k.a server be absolutely adorable
-PRON- girlfriend 's kid love the california_roll and slider
-PRON- love the variety_of udon
do_not forget to order the honey toast for dessert
definitely must save room in -PRON- tummy for that
lol
this_place be bomb
the texas toast be everything and the chicken be so juicy
the coleslaw be okay nothing to rave_about
give -PRON- a try
-PRON- take -PRON- car here to fix -PRON- manual clutch but decide to have someone_else fix -PRON- after be quote $_1000 less from another shop
the customer_service here be horrible and the people be extremely_rude so rude that -PRON- would have pay more to have -PRON- fix somewhere_else just to avoid be talk down to
four_star for delicious food
the place be pack to the rafter on saturday_night so make a reservation well in_advance
-PRON- have app and entree and split a chocolate dessert sampler
heavenly
nice bar and good wine_selection
arrive_early
-PRON- service be still spot on and -PRON- be seat relatively quickly but still have to wait about_15_minute despite have reservation
good breakfast in_town hand_down
-PRON- drive far to eat_here and do -PRON- on a regular basis
great breakfast at a fair_price and friendly_staff
-PRON- just wish -PRON- be close
stop_by here for a mid afternoon bite and be a little disappointed to find that -PRON- be out of jerk_chicken
luckily -PRON- have some in the oven and -PRON- have only wait 10_minute_before -PRON- be serve
so for $_10 -PRON- be serve four piece_of pip_hot jerk_chicken one large plate of rice and bean with a generous helping of gravy and one coleslaw
good value
the coleslaw be yummy
perhaps the good -PRON- have have the rice with gravy be so tasty and the chicken be pretty_good as_well
except -PRON- be not jerk_chicken
-PRON- be like some kind_of rotisserie or bbq chicken with a_bit of a kick but definitely not authentic jerk
-PRON- do_not_know if this be a one off look_at the other_review on here or whether people just do_not_know_what real jerk be
strangely in other respect the place be very authentic and have a true jamaican vibe
-PRON- be willing_to give this_place another shot but the jerk here can_not compare with the stuff -PRON- have at the ritz locate at yonge college
-PRON- know the kind with the strong flavorful jerk spice and the meat that just fall_off the bone
visit in glendale -PRON- eat_here after hear_about -PRON- on ddd
the food be excellent
the calamari be light and not overbatter and be not chewy at all
cooked to perfection
-PRON- order pizza and ravioli and -PRON- be very good
the waitstaff be very_friendly and helpful
a wonderful experience
the only_downside be -PRON- serve soda out of a bottle which can get expensive with kid around
-PRON- salute the team that design the space and setup
trendy with a good sport straight up bar vibe
definitely a place -PRON- could feel_comfortable bring a boss coworker just the friend or if -PRON- be a solo adventurist -PRON- work
the bartender do make a good old_fashioned with a_bit too large of a block of ice
the bar be loud and by that when the server can_not hear -PRON- order -PRON- mean loud
the menu have some great ethnic blend with traditional bar burger and steak option
-PRON- venture for the curry crisp cauliflower and the lettuce_wrap and also have a friend try the butter_chicken entree
while the concept be good the flavor fall shy
the cauliflower be a little undercooked and not enough sauce to blend the flavor cause the curry spice to be overpower
the lettuce_wrap lack all flavor and just be not good
in_addition while -PRON- love the attention have multiple server be confusing
overall not a place -PRON- would eat at again although a drink could draw -PRON- in
show_up to the restaurant around 4 p.m. and the place be not_too_crowded
-PRON- be sit promptly and -PRON- waiter come to get -PRON- drink request
with two other family_member -PRON- order water and 2 happy_hour margaritas and chip and salsa
the chip and salsa be deliver first after a few_minute
the water do_not come for another ten fifteen_minute
once the water come -PRON- take another ten_minute for the margaritas when -PRON- arrive -PRON- order be then take
when -PRON- receive -PRON- drink -PRON- ask for another basket of chip and cup of salsa
15_20 minute_later -PRON- receive -PRON- food
after -PRON- be do eat -PRON- entree the request chip and salsa be bring to the table -PRON- decline -PRON- as -PRON- be already ready to leave at this point
when the check come -PRON- attempt to charge -PRON- for the second basket of chip and salsa
-PRON- explain -PRON- would not be pay for the chip and salsa
-PRON- do_not take because -PRON- take until -PRON- be do eat when -PRON- arrive
and -PRON- decline -PRON-
in the time -PRON- take to receive -PRON- food -PRON- notice a couple behind -PRON- complain once that -PRON- do_not receive drink or food yet while eat -PRON- food -PRON- be not deliver and -PRON- end_up leave after complain to the manager
overall the food and drink be good but the service and time -PRON- take to receive everything be just awful
will not return to this_place on -PRON- next_visit
first_off the owner be lovely
-PRON- be very_personable and -PRON- dog like spending time with -PRON-
sadly that be the only positive feedback -PRON- have
after an afternoon tromp around in the wood -PRON- take -PRON- long haired dog in for a bath
-PRON- call_ahead on the phone to confirm pricing and make_sure -PRON- have an opening
-PRON- be tell $ 32 for a bath base_on -PRON- weight and extra if -PRON- want to have -PRON- nail trim
-PRON- drop -PRON- off and have to repeatedly explain that no -PRON- do_not want -PRON- fur cut -PRON- just need a bath and maybe -PRON- pad trim but that be -PRON-
-PRON- be ask to pay before the service which be fine except for the fact_that -PRON- be charge_$ 60 not $ 32 as originally tell and ask for a tip before the service be render
repeatedly clarify that no -PRON- do_not need a haircut just a bath and a_bit of polish
imagine -PRON- chagrin when -PRON- come_back two hour_later to see -PRON- poor dog that have be groom within an inch of -PRON- life
the groomer probably take a good four inch off everywhere
and -PRON- mean everywhere
oh except where -PRON- would specifically ask for -PRON- no pad trim be do
-PRON- would even make a point to say please do_not cut -PRON- feathering on -PRON- leg and chest when -PRON- drop -PRON- off but -PRON- fall on deaf ear
-PRON- coat have be completely butcher and -PRON- be just hop a few_month will be enough for -PRON- to look more like -PRON-
tl;dr friendly but overprice
feel_like -PRON- do_not listen to -PRON- at all and -PRON- dog end_up with a butcher unrequested haircut
-PRON- will not be go_back
this_place be simply wonderful
-PRON- have try several sushi place in_madison probably all of -PRON- and in -PRON- opinion this be the good
-PRON- do_not expect this delicious sushi from a place that have both a chinese and a japanese menu but -PRON- be really good
the only_thing -PRON- do_not love be the chef_'s special
the price and the atmoshpere be really nice too
go here for first_time in year to practice bingo with teri w -PRON- folk -PRON- mom beet
-PRON- be a crappy player not since ny church play w -PRON- nonna and stamp through all -PRON- card only make -PRON- suckier

-PRON- date really like that the get to enjoy two flavor
-PRON- also say that the spicy thing be like spicy miso so -PRON- add additional flavor\/depth

so -PRON- do_not feel the need to add any(there 's garlic on the table if -PRON- want to add -PRON-
-PRON- also get gyoza and fry_rice
the gyoza be good
but -PRON- be really really fascinated by the fry_rice
that be like the perfect fry_rice -PRON- would get at a japanese raman place
wish -PRON- live closer so -PRON- could go_back
-PRON- get there like ten_minute after open on sunday and the place be already fill
-PRON- would_highly_recommend fred astaire dance studios especially the paradise valley location
-PRON- offer different level of instruction from novice to advanced technique and style
in_addition -PRON- have many different style of dance that be available to learn
the group class workshop and group outing be so_much_fun
-PRON- always greet -PRON- whenever -PRON- fiancé and -PRON- walk_into the location and -PRON- always make -PRON- feel_welcome
every instructor be friendly and always willing_to answer question
-PRON- be currently take private lesson with jasmine and -PRON- be absolutely_amazing

richard pueyo offer to have -PRON- replace right_away and ask if that be what -PRON- want to do
-PRON- can_not tell -PRON- how thankful -PRON- be to richard and ruben for help -PRON- out at the last_minute
-PRON- guy be awesome
thank -PRON- richard and ruben
graveyard server be absolutely shitty sit for almost 15_minute and get no service
what so ever
-PRON- would be one thing if -PRON- be busy but there be only one other table in the entire place(sitting right_next to -PRON-
and -PRON- go up to -PRON- even_though -PRON- be seat way after -PRON- and still completely ignore -PRON-
shitty ass service
this_place be awesome
-PRON- hairstylist monica be amazing
-PRON- always leave with a highly satisfied cut
-PRON- can drink beer and take shot while -PRON- be here and even shoot some pool
overall this_place be an affordable high class place for man to pamper -PRON-
this be a taco_bell
-PRON- will not talk much about the food because -PRON- be a taco_bell
-PRON- know_what -PRON- can expect
what -PRON- -will- say be -PRON- have never have anything screw_up here
-PRON- have be to taco bells where order a 7-layer burrito one of -PRON- favorite item mean -PRON- get something that taste entirely of guacamole because -PRON- put twice as much of -PRON- in as -PRON- should
-PRON- have never encounter that here everything be balance correctly and whatev menu_item -PRON- order will come to -PRON- exactly as -PRON- should
so with that out of the way and -PRON- hopefully be clear that this rating be not about the food -PRON- do_not expect fine mexican dining
because -PRON- be a 5-star -PRON- be still a taco_bell on to why this review
what set this taco_bell apart from other besides obviously the make the food right be the service
as other people have indicate -PRON- be good
very good
the people be friendly
almost too friendly -PRON- can feel a little cloying sometimes
but that be still far far good_than the alternative and even when -PRON- find -PRON- a tad irritating -PRON- still leave with a smile on -PRON- face after have deal with the people here
-PRON- be do something right when -PRON- come to customer_service
this hide gem tuck in the lobby of an office building be -PRON- favorite lunch spot
the food be delicious fresh and come with a side of laughter
the sandwich be fantastic the quesadilla delicious and the breakfast_burrito the good in_town and be available all day
if -PRON- have the chance to get the potato salad- take -PRON-

all of -PRON-
this_place be a great little_gem in this area
-PRON- be so_excited that -PRON- be near -PRON- house
and -PRON- also deliver
-PRON- can get sushi and chinese
whatev -PRON- be feel
the roll be always fresh and tasty and -PRON- 1\/2 price sushi deal be amazing
love this studio and -PRON- pilates community
if -PRON- be look for top_notch instruction this be the place
plus -PRON- be spotlessly clean and all equipment be expertly maintain
after get a full tune up from the dealership last_year chapman -PRON- be tell -PRON- probably have a year leave on -PRON- brake
-PRON- notice the front brake squeak a_bit and a lot_of brake dust on the wheel so -PRON- make_an_appointment here at whitey 's for new brake
after drop -PRON- off and walk over to denny_'s for breakfast -PRON- get a call tell -PRON- that the brake be good just dirty
so -PRON- just clean -PRON- up and give -PRON- an oil_change as_well
less_than $_60
-PRON- think -PRON- be go to spend about $_250 that day
saved about $ 190
that be good stuff
-PRON- will take -PRON- car and -PRON- wife 's car to whitey 's from now on
-PRON- have recently be in an_accident in -PRON- subaru
walk_away with no injury thankfulness and the need of a new car
-PRON- know -PRON- want another subaru
after check around -PRON- get a good price from subaru south blvd
great buying_experience with tommy tucker -PRON- sale_person
-PRON- find the car -PRON- want help -PRON- throughout the process and -PRON- get -PRON- perfect car
as classically delicious as breakfast get
-PRON- definitely suggest to be ready to wait but -PRON- be bearable aside_from there be a very small area inside to wait
the muffin be great
-PRON- just hire efficiency mechanical to come_out to -PRON- house -PRON- recently_purchase to install an exhaust fan in -PRON- master bathroom and to re insulate -PRON- attic
matt come_out to give -PRON- estimate and be very_helpful in answer all question -PRON- have about add the insulation and the exhaust vent
-PRON- get back to -PRON- very fast with a very fair quote
and -PRON- choose to use -PRON- service
a_few day_later -PRON- set_up a time for -PRON- to come do the work the two guy_who show_up be very_friendly and -PRON- could tell -PRON- be knowledgeable_about what -PRON- be do
-PRON- wish -PRON- could remember -PRON- name -PRON- be great
-PRON- put down protection to cover -PRON- flooring etc
so -PRON- would not get damage or dirty during the process
-PRON- instal the fan first and then blow in the insulation
during the installation of the vent -PRON- come to -PRON- to let -PRON- know that -PRON- other bathroom 's vent duct work be not instal properly and the flapper be not open fully
-PRON- let -PRON- know -PRON- have already fix -PRON- for -PRON- even_though -PRON- be not a part of the scope of work include in -PRON- bid
-PRON- also tell -PRON- one of -PRON- a\/c duct be leak air which -PRON- also fix without ask for any more money
this be all extra work -PRON- do_not have to do or -PRON- could have ask for more money but be an ethical company -PRON- make_sure -PRON- be not just add what -PRON- ask for but make_sure everything around -PRON- be work properly as_well
all in all -PRON- seem as -PRON- finish the job pretty quick and come to -PRON- to inspect -PRON- work before -PRON- leave
there be a_few drywall nail that have pop out a_little_bit in the ceiling from -PRON- cut and\/or walking crawl around the attic
-PRON- grab -PRON- drywall compound right_away and patch up all the hole without_any question as to whether -PRON- cause -PRON- or not
-PRON- offer to come_back to paint over the compound for -PRON- as_well which -PRON- decline as -PRON- already have other patch paint work to do from the electrician before -PRON-
-PRON- let -PRON- climb up to the attic to inspect the insulation verify the depth agree on and be on -PRON- way
altogether a great experience rare for a lot_of contractor
but if -PRON- ever need mechanical work on this house or any_other down the road efficiency have earn a customer for life thank for the great work
delicious food and great service
-PRON- waiter david be so patient -PRON- not only go_through almost ever item on the menu but also provide great recommendation
-PRON- have a fantastic dining_experience and enjoy every dish -PRON- have pasta and soufflé
definitely_come_back
-PRON- have be here many many_time as -PRON- live around the corner and -PRON- be always nice to treat -PRON- once in a while
the food be reliably delicious
unfortunately the service be terrible
the poor waiter do -PRON- good but the place always seem to be understaffed and as a result the waiter be just run_around forget order spill thing drop thing apologize for long_wait etc
-PRON- always wait at_least 30_minute to get -PRON- plate sometimes almost as much before someone take -PRON- order
good food but at a price
great for local as -PRON- offer a discount
great for selection of food and great for value
many buffet be over price in lv and this one be price about right
many good selection and if -PRON- be not happy the management be good about special request
-PRON- eat_here a_few day_ago with a bachelorette_party and -PRON- be by_far everyone 's favorite restaurant for the weekend
-PRON- service be great and -PRON- definitely suggest try the sangria
the white be -PRON- favorite but the red be yummy too
and the meatball on the happy_hour menu be incredible
beautiful room and the staff be really friendly
definitely_return soon
have -PRON- eyelash do a couple time at other place but want a soon app
-PRON- eyelash be fall out before even leave the place
-PRON- be not be 2_week
and -PRON- have one eye with absolutely no lash and the other half way full
never have eyelash fall_off this quickly
do_not recommend due_to the quality of the work
the staff be exceptionally friendly and accomodat the ingredient be fresh and the thick_noodle be to die for
-PRON- have work -PRON- way_through the whole menu and the cha cha cha and sprout up raman be unparall in deliciousness
pro tip
get the $ 1.50 side order of extra noodle
-PRON- decide to wander in here while -PRON- be make -PRON- way between hotel and -PRON- look_like a good time
-PRON- start with the scotch egg which be a must
-PRON- hubs say -PRON- be the good one -PRON- ever have -PRON- be not quite the connoisseur -PRON- be but -PRON- find -PRON- really good as_well
-PRON- have to try the fish and chip and -PRON- be ok a little soggy and -PRON- hubs have the rueban and -PRON- say -PRON- be mediocre
service be ok nothing to write_home_about
there be good pub in_vegas and this one be middle_of the road
so for a quiet thursday evening the lady
and -PRON- decide -PRON- want to go out for dinner
-PRON- ahve be want to come_here for quite some time so be excited to visit
the venue -PRON- be superb beautiful place great staff and a very_welcoming environment
service overall be great if perhaps the attention to detail lack a little
for the food -PRON- order the pork_belly with black pudding apple sauce and curly kale
the pork_belly be fairly tasty for -PRON- -PRON- have not be cook at high enough temperature the fat have not remotely go crispy\/crunchy and be just really pure fat sad face
the meat be ok -PRON- have not be cook in anything so have go a little dry
the black pudding be just smear of what i take be black pudding do_not satisfy -PRON- desire at all
apple sauce ok but lack that sugar sweetness
desert -PRON- have a reasonable attempt at an apple crumble be for -PRON- again slightly undercooked
all in all ok
but for the money spend -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- club
with that say the past couple artist -PRON- have see at the beauty bar have be great minus the mc
-PRON- pay to see artist play -PRON- music not some asshole yell over the beat -PRON- pay to hear
the mc make a point to approach -PRON- in the audience an ask what -PRON- problem be with -PRON- mc skill
-PRON- tell -PRON- politely that -PRON- be here to see the artist on the headliner not hear -PRON- yell
-PRON- proceed to have two different female approach -PRON- an ask what -PRON- problem be with -PRON- performance an that -PRON- be pay to be there an
-PRON- could leave if -PRON- dislike -PRON- mc' long_story_short the mc for the sleeper show be straight amateur hour an
-PRON- hope -PRON- guy_who throw the show bring good talent next show
that mc be a straight embarrassment to the show
h&m be one of the bad store out there
-PRON- poor elderly mother think that -PRON- like this store that be why every christmas -PRON- end_up get a $_250 gift_card and have_no_idea what to buy because the clothe in this store be of such poor_quality after 3 wash -PRON- have either fall_apart or the colour end_up look as wash out as lindsay lohan 's life
this particular h&m be the bad there be way_too many basic and garbage that high_school kid can afford to buy with -PRON- pocket money
the store be always a distaster area the change room line be too_long there be just not enough of anything worthwhile in this store
-PRON- come_out with -PRON- $_250 gift cert which if -PRON- can_not sell on craigslist -PRON- will just give -PRON- to a random coke head
at_least the card will be somewhat useful to someone
-PRON- love the cracked egg
-PRON- stop_by on -PRON- way out of town and -PRON- be so_glad -PRON- do
the coffee be always good the coffee cake be always good and service be always good
-PRON- be the good little breakfast joint a girl could hope for
last_time -PRON- go -PRON- get the egg_white omelet which be something -PRON- have never have before
-PRON- expect -PRON- to taste healthy
however -PRON- be very surprised at the amazing flavor because -PRON- have pepper and salsa to go with -PRON-
-PRON- be delicious
and less guilt
do_not worry
-PRON- make up for -PRON- with the coffee cake scarfage
-PRON- whole group love all the dish -PRON- get and leave with a full belly and smile on -PRON- face
now to stay out of -PRON- food coma for the car ride back to la

thief thief thief
i just get finish get -PRON- car_wash and oil_change do and practically every miscellaneous thing in -PRON- car be go
-PRON- cash loose change and even -PRON- car title be go
on_top_of that -PRON- leave -PRON- ac blast and all -PRON- door unlock
i have already file a police report and i only wish i would have read the other_review about steal property which be apparently a common trend
i feel_like i just pay to get rob
as -PRON- can see this_place take no responsibility for stealing
if -PRON- be such a lair be all of these thief relate review lie also
how can this_place be so ignorant to not take responsibility for stealing
now customer be liar when stuff get steal
let see what the investigation turn up smart ass
burrito boyz become -PRON- favorite burrito spot in_toronto
crispy on the outside and a whole lot_of flavor on the inside
-PRON- tell -PRON- that the alternator need to be replace on -PRON- car when -PRON- be fine
the quote for the new alternator be so high -PRON- take -PRON- car somewhere_else
the new shop replace the battery and everything be fine
-PRON- could have be out $ 700 due_to the misdiagnosis
avoid -PRON- service department
by_far the bad barista service ever from a starbucks
as an avid starbucks customer -PRON- have to say that this be the bad location ever for customer_service
-PRON- be in today with -PRON- two small child and brother who have cerebral palsy spend_$ 20 on food and drink
-PRON- be not that crowd and -PRON- stroller get knock over and -PRON- coffee spill on the ground
no service\/ help at all from the starbucks employee
-PRON- and another customer probably feel sorry for this overwhelmed mamma help -PRON- clean up most of the floor and then finally a starbucks employee come_out with a mop -PRON- do_not say a word even after -PRON- apologize mind -PRON- another customer
and -PRON- have already clean up most of the mess
-PRON- find -PRON- kind_of bizarre that another customer actually offer to buy -PRON- another coffee but the employee do_not say one word or even offer -PRON- any service after
-PRON- be shocked and almost sad that the starbucks would allow -PRON- employee to treat -PRON- customer this way
-PRON- garage sin city be here to serve -PRON- for all -PRON- diy motorcycle part and accessory need
if -PRON- have any_question or would like a price for a specific part call -PRON- if -PRON- do_not have -PRON-

be this the good sushi -PRON- ever eat
no
not even close
but be -PRON- a fun environment with decent roll and cheap
yes
the sushi come in small order start at around $ 1.50 and move up to about $_4 or $_5
there be nothing_special about the roll at sushi station but the price be a lot cheap_than grocery_store sushi and the quality be much good
the tuna and avocado roll the salmon and avocado roll and spicy crunchy salmon roll be all good
a total of 8 order for two people come to a little more_than $_17
good deal
just a note for some people look_at the menu
every special roll most appetizer and most salad have shell fish in -PRON-
-PRON- be mostly prepp and can_not be change
if -PRON- have a food allergy or other dietary restriction this may not be -PRON- sushi place
this be -PRON- new fav shopping outlet amazing price variety
food court indoor love the entire place friendly and attentive employee at store like michael kor aldo old navy
ok so -PRON- give this_location two try
and -PRON- strike out on both
the recent review be very on point
as -PRON- state in -PRON- review for plato 's closet -PRON- have a background in fashion
-PRON- be name best dress in school every year
if anyone know incoming fashion trend -PRON- be -PRON-
if anyone understand business rutger baby -PRON- be -PRON-
but tell -PRON- that the clothe -PRON- have be not appropriate be downright laughable
-PRON- even call before go to see what -PRON- want spring and take half of that and half of the transitional item
-PRON- take none
first of all -PRON- need to get over -PRON-

-PRON- organize a small dinner party here during a conference
the food be excellent
the service be okay but not incredible and -PRON- do feel that when -PRON- have a party of 20 -PRON- should be incredible
there be a_few time when -PRON- have to go find -PRON- waiter especially towards the end of the meal
and that should not be the case in this price point
-PRON- expectation be high for the food and -PRON- deliver in that area
these_guy do a great_job with -PRON- move
-PRON- be on time and take_care with all of -PRON- item to be sure not to damage anything
-PRON- be friendly and efficient and also the most reasonable of all the move company -PRON- call

-PRON- stay in the venetian last_year and the suite be pretty comparable except the room in the palazzo be a little big and slightly nice
the big difference be the service
man the folk in the palazzo know_how to treat -PRON-
-PRON- be a sucker for service and thus -PRON- give this_place a 5_star rating
-PRON- love how -PRON- go the extra mile to make -PRON- comfortable
the hotel in_general be gorgeous and be as -PRON- husband like to say baller
-PRON- totally think this_place be worth the price
should have read the other_review before drop in
service be terrible with food and drink hardly worth the wait
-PRON- give this show 2_star but -PRON- husband like -PRON- better so -PRON- mark -PRON- as 3
-PRON- get ticket from half price ticket booth on the strip for $ 53 per_person and -PRON- be glad -PRON- do_not pay more
-PRON- agree with most of the review that give -PRON- 2_3 star
-PRON- be mildly entertaining at moment but a lot_of the time -PRON- be just wish -PRON- would end
-PRON- would explain some trick which be interesting but -PRON- still would not tell -PRON- how -PRON- really do -PRON-
but most of the trick just last too_long so by the end
-PRON- do_not even want to know_how -PRON- be do eg
the bullet trick
-PRON- just seem too simplistic
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be hard to perfect but -PRON- be visually unimpressive
to go to rio -PRON- can take a shuttle leave either from harrah 's all -PRON- be in the back of the casino or from bally's\/paris
-PRON- be not quite as much of a cigar smoker as -PRON- use to be
the year have start to catch_up with -PRON-
but when -PRON- get the hankering this be where -PRON- go
-PRON- know -PRON- cigar and offer alternative to the well know brand
-PRON- be close enough for most purpose
if -PRON- be truly an aficionado -PRON- have the real thing too all store in a perfectly cool and moist environment
-PRON- do_not_know_how much lung capacity -PRON- sacrifice while this_place be liquidate the last of the pierre cardin maxim 's -PRON- buy out from some swank place in paris
-PRON- be a deal at about $_20 a bundle and -PRON- be quite addict
-PRON- even ship -PRON- to -PRON- when -PRON- live for a time in colorado
always very_nice on the phone
-PRON- even have stay open a_bit late for -PRON- when -PRON- have call_ahead
this_place have tank
what a dive
wall furniture decor be destroy need redo
bathroom be a disaster doubt -PRON- be wipe_down on a daily basis
bathroom in need of supply
garbage can overflow
staff yell_at other staff_member
food be fine but this_place have fall_apart
employee mean well
rubios management need to reassess this_location
love_this_place
-PRON- have be come since -PRON- open back before -PRON- adjust the price when a bagel could cost -PRON- $_16
love walk_in for a coffee a chub chub bagel a rugelach or a warm donut in the morning
the portion be massive and delicious
the staff be so friendly and patient
fantastic stuff
all fish come_out warm
-PRON- have to flag_down 3 people before get -PRON- order
do_not take american express
will not come_back
-PRON- have a really good time here because of the solid music selection outstanding sound_system and mostly the cheap drink
the bar -PRON- be relatively small but the point be to have an open space to dance the night away
which -PRON- will
the bathroom be a_bit shady and -PRON- girlfriend run into one creep up there but that be an isolated incident
as a side note-
the bar be not actually underground but at the top of a flight of stair
go to south of temperance for some after work drink that turn_into staying for dinner
sot have a_bit of that sleazy banker\/lawyer\/general suit wear vibe but -PRON- be in the middle_of the financial district so -PRON- be excusable and not the bad -PRON- have see
at_least -PRON- be friendly sleaze
=)
-PRON- be also good for drink because -PRON- manage to pack a lot_of people into the place so -PRON- can always get in but that also mean -PRON- can get pretty uncomfortable with everyone stand shoulder to shoulder around the bar_area
at the risk of sound old -PRON- be also incredibly loud inside with the music crank to a level where everyone have to yell to be hear
and as the night go on and people leave -PRON- just turn up the music even louder
-PRON- swear -PRON- have be to quieter club
the drink be on_par or even maybe even a tiny bit_more expensive than other place in the area at $_7.50 a pint
but the food be decent with okay price especially compare to drink price
-PRON- have a temperance burger for about $_15 2 drink = 1 burger
and -PRON- enjoy -PRON-
find -PRON- new nail_salon in the city
-PRON- be in desperate need of a manicure after just do -PRON- own nail for about 6_month
-PRON- cuticle be feel the cold weather and need some tlc so -PRON- head to m nail_salon on the recommendation of -PRON- good friend
-PRON- call that day and get an_appointment for the same evening
the parking_lot be adjacent to the salon which be amazing consider parking in shadyside can be tough
-PRON- walk_in and be greet right_away by one of the tech and have a seat
-PRON- see 3 or 4 set of color sample on the coffee table
so -PRON- start look for -PRON- color
-PRON- find one that be acceptable and be call back to the nail station within a few_minute
-PRON- show the tech the color -PRON- pick but then -PRON- show -PRON- the entire box of color sample that be next to -PRON- station
apparently the client before -PRON- just have not put the box back on the coffee table
there be lot_of bottle_of polish in the wait area that -PRON- can look_at but -PRON- do_not believe the gel brand be up there as the tech actually have to go to the back to retrieve -PRON- chosen gel color
so if -PRON- go and do_not see a huge variety_of color to pick from ask
there be almost tooooo many once -PRON- get the box of nail goodness
anyway -PRON- have a great thorough manicure and some light conversation with -PRON- tech
-PRON- be young energetic and diligent about make_sure -PRON- nail look perfect before polish -PRON-
two week_later and -PRON- be still in pristine condition save for the one tiny chip that show_up yesterday
even after do a lot_of no no stuff with this manicure like cleaning wash dish without glove and painting -PRON- still look perfect
-PRON- can_not wait to go_back tomorrow for a fresh manicure for the holiday season
a full gel_manicure run $_30 not include a soak off
also to note -PRON- do_not_accept tip on card
-PRON- actually request -PRON- make -PRON- entire payment in cash if possible and there be an atm right next_door if -PRON- need -PRON-
-PRON- be so please at the process of build a pool with sunkiss pools
-PRON- have be in -PRON- house for many_year and finally decide to take the plunge
the design process be so fun
bryan provide the 3d drawing to show what -PRON- yard could be and be -PRON- ever surprised
the time frame be about 12 week from signing of contract to completion
-PRON- meet every date and be always communicate
-PRON- address any of concern with prompt professionalism
and can -PRON- just say the finished pool be beyond -PRON- expectation and dream
-PRON- can_not wait to use -PRON- this spring as -PRON- get -PRON- heated to enjoy a long swim season
thank -PRON- to sunkiss pools for a dream come true
feel this_place have be here since like forever though -PRON- do_not go there all the time -PRON- always like go here because unlike destiny -PRON- food be adequate and decent enough for dinner and -PRON- find -PRON- customer_service be always so_much good_than destiny
the downfall be -PRON- place be so busy -PRON- be very hard to get seat at busy time
however -PRON- can call and make_reservation
-PRON- drink have more variety and -PRON- actually feel bang for -PRON- buck without get rip_off or overprice item
-PRON- also love -PRON- have a separate round square table at the back or small private room for group
-PRON- will_definitely miss this_place since -PRON- close down since feb 22nd and -PRON- new location be due_to open in downtown markham but when
-PRON- will not know
what an_amazing place
-PRON- son love go to school -PRON- have not have a day -PRON- do_not want to go
the teacher and director be wonderful
-PRON- do the good crock pot cooking class
-PRON- be just a wonderful and warm atmosp
trashy
unorganized
inefficient
just a_few word that describe this store every_time -PRON- frequent
-PRON- rarely go to jo ann fabrics except out of desperation in look for something
of_course think this visit will be different
-PRON- will say -PRON- never_fail to meet this standard
hobby lobby have jo ann fabrics beat on every level
-PRON- would consider this_place if -PRON- be try to save on hotel
-PRON- pay 500 for two night
that be a pretty_good deal
however be warn -PRON- -PRON- not the clean of hotel nor be -PRON- one of the most modern of -PRON-
-PRON- just do the job
-PRON- be a place to sleep and a place to shower
the service be nice
the concierge be super_friendly and always helpful
the front_desk representative be super_friendly as_well
the good part be if -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- email at check in -PRON- get a email check_out link

both time -PRON- be impressed_with the wait staff décor and most_importantly the delicious food
do_not leave without order the warm brussel_sprout caesar_salad or the butter_chicken
for lunch the blackened fish tacos be delicious
this be mostly a small_plate restaurant which -PRON- have find can be pricy but in this case completely worth -PRON-
the menu have a mix of mediterranean and indian_food
again the butter_chicken be incredible -PRON- will want to drink the sauce
hummus and naan be also great if -PRON- be not too adventurous
if -PRON- be still stump ask -PRON- server for recommendation
for wonderful fish dish this intimate resturant can_not be beat yummy
have travel the 215 freeway many_time while live on the south west area of las_vegas this gas_station be very convenient
but that be kinda the idea for these place anyway right
-PRON- have a car_wash and many lane of brightly light pump for night visit
the main building be locate next to several fast_food restaurant
so once -PRON- fill_up -PRON- can get a quick wash and then a snack all without leave the immediate area
-PRON- have not be happy with this_place in the past however some friend want to go here
-PRON- will be -PRON- last

the food be standard dennys food so 3_star usually
-PRON- be take a star off because -PRON- server be mia and -PRON- take_forever to order and get refill or steak sauce
grant -PRON- go in the wee hour of morning and be 1 of 2 table in the place but -PRON- would think that would make thing easy on -PRON-
guess -PRON- be not in -PRON- for the money
location first of all gps do_not indicate what side of the street the location be on
if -PRON- miss the salon -PRON- will have to do two u turn in order to get back to -PRON-

-PRON- grandma have be a customer for 44 year
and -PRON- have recently review -PRON- statement and figure_out -PRON- have be over charge for over 2 year by pay for 2 box when -PRON- only have 1
-PRON- have make multiple attempt to contact cox and talk to a supervisor
and guess_what
no luck
-PRON- have have agent tell -PRON- -PRON- need to wait for a supervisor to be available and -PRON- can_not call -PRON- back
be -PRON- kid -PRON-
maybe cox should look_at -PRON- mission statement as an organization
-PRON- have be try to get a hold of someone for 4 day and no luck
guess -PRON- be time to call and get other involve
-PRON- keep tell -PRON- -PRON- should switch to att
but -PRON- have not
at_least not yet
this_company should be ashamed of -PRON- san_diego operations
the location be great
the room rate be great for what -PRON- get
the service be awful
be not the hooters girl suppose to be nice to customer
the only good service be in the restaurant and -PRON- be not even the hooters restaurant
-PRON- friend and -PRON- agree that this be probably one of the funn night -PRON- have have
the guy be great look the music be awesome -PRON- be great dancer and the crowd be cool
-PRON- have moment where -PRON- pull girl on stage and dance for -PRON-
-PRON- be there for a small bachelorette_party and the bride really want to get on stage

but -PRON- be so happy when -PRON- do
-PRON- really want to thank aussie hunk for make -PRON- night truly enjoyable
-PRON- should add that if -PRON- do_not like hip_hop music then -PRON- may not be as enjoyable for -PRON-
-PRON- love the music so that make -PRON- good
very_disappointing food although the staff be very_friendly
go around 1045pm but the place be about to close even_though -PRON- advertise -PRON- be open until 1_a.m.
order ravioli gyro cheesesteak and beef pepper sandwich
except for the beef everything_else have very low salt and not much flavor
the pepper beef have too_much salt and be very dry
also the order take around 30_min to prepare which again be just wrong
would not recommend bad food slow service
over the past_few_year -PRON- have have many meal here at sourdough cafe
some hit and some miss
but that be the human factor of eat out
-PRON- never know if -PRON- be there on an off day for the restaurant or if -PRON- be on the ball
but the quality of sourdough remain the same
the food be pretty_good
everything from the player card special to the dessert
nothing mind_blow
but -PRON- leave satisfied
with all of that say here be -PRON- review from -PRON- last_visit
for good access to sourdough cafe park on the top floor of the parking_lot
-PRON- be on the right hand side as -PRON- walk_through the door
-PRON- stand in line to wait to be seat
-PRON- be not that busy
but -PRON- seem_like -PRON- always have to wait for a couple of minute_before -PRON- seat -PRON-
no big_deal
-PRON- be lead to -PRON- table and give -PRON- menu
but there be no need as -PRON- only have one thing on -PRON- mind
the huge banana splits
yum a dum dum
-PRON- take a few_minute for -PRON- drink order to be take and a couple of minute more for the server to get to -PRON-
again no big_deal
-PRON- be a good time to catch_up and hangout with friend
so -PRON- order -PRON- boat of ice_cream
vanilla strawberry chocolate ice_cream banana various sauce mountain of whip_cream sprinkle of nut and a cherry
in the past -PRON- have make the mistake of order one just for -PRON- only to claim defeat
not this time
there be four of -PRON- and -PRON- buy two to split
-PRON- be gluttonous and before -PRON- hit sweet overload -PRON- order some fry to counter -PRON-
smart thinking
and so the night end with the check
-PRON- do_not remember how_much -PRON- be exactly
but -PRON- believe the banana splits be only $_6 a pop
what a great deal
on a side_note -PRON- find out that the server have to make the banana split -PRON-
and -PRON- be tell that if -PRON- want need more nuts or whip_cream to let -PRON- know
-PRON- make_sure to tip well after -PRON- hear that
so good job
another side_note
-PRON- would have take picture
but -PRON- be give a ration of crap from -PRON- friend for try to do so earlier
and be insecure because of -PRON- -PRON- do_not take any
-PRON- will man up next_time
have the lobster egg benedicts and pancake
great tasting and very reasonably_price
good service in a very traditional cosy place
will_definitely be miss
-PRON- favorite breakfast\/brunch place by_far
-PRON- have amazing pancake flavor and -PRON- be huge
-PRON- have the lemon blueberry and oatmeal protein
delicious
-PRON- be clean and the service be great
-PRON- be very small inside
so -PRON- either have to be patient or beat the rush
-PRON- have to average this experience out
the vanilla frozen custard alone be 5_star incredible
-PRON- try -PRON- other know item to fellow_yelper and well -PRON- just do_not get -PRON-
a total pass on anything_else
-PRON- have the burger and -PRON- be so squished dry and salty -PRON- be not right
the burger -PRON- have no flavor other_than salt
-PRON- be extremely disappointing
visually -PRON- be also unappeal
the meat be super odd and creepy
-PRON- also try the shoe string fry and -PRON- could_not even eat -PRON-
-PRON- be way_too_salty and visually salt throughout
yuck
the only_thing worth -PRON- at freddy 's be -PRON- vanilla freeze custard without topping
-PRON- think -PRON- 3_star be be gracious
this be -PRON- first_visit to this market
there be a wide_variety of vendor
a_few selling produce a_few selling finish food tamale jerky etc and some craft
-PRON- be tell -PRON- have more produce during winter
-PRON- look_forward_to try -PRON- again at that time
live in gilbert
-PRON- be not really worth the drive compare to the market in gilbert
-PRON- be a nice market and -PRON- will try again this winter
let -PRON- start by say that -PRON- spend 16 year in the restaurant business and this be by_far one of the good restaurant -PRON- have ever be to
manager beth and -PRON- staff set -PRON- apart from almost_every other service staff -PRON- have ever see in efficiency generosity and unflinchingly warm customer_service
when face with a hungry 1 year_old -PRON- offer berry before the water even come to the table
beth always stop_by to say hello and despite a city of 2 million people-
-PRON- would swear -PRON- genuinely remember -PRON- every_time
-PRON- kill it with amazing service
now the food-
well -PRON- have die and go to heaven

-PRON- be just as amazing as any of the entree
from the butcher to the bathroom this be a not to be miss dining_experience
-PRON- have not visit true food in a few_year but someone give -PRON- a gift_card so -PRON- venture out
-PRON- update -PRON- menu and -PRON- be very very very small
one page with maybe 15 item on -PRON-
not much of a selection limited option for someone_who be soy free and gluten_free to less_than a handful
-PRON- order the lasagna which be way overpower with spice -PRON- burn -PRON- tongue and very very spicy
-PRON- order the ancient grain bowl with no miso and sunflower seed rather_than hemp seed
and -PRON- be very good and fill would order -PRON- again
wish -PRON- have more vegan_option and the menu be a little big
-PRON- brother have the a bowl as_well and -PRON- also order a coconut refresher
two bowl one refresher drink -PRON- come_out to about $ 25.per person
wish -PRON- have gf pizza
-PRON- be cool enough to sit_outside but lot_of fly good place for healthy food if -PRON- can find something on the menu but if -PRON- have allergy the choice be limit
the ancient grain bowl -PRON- would go_back for
plus -PRON- have key lime pie yummy
-PRON- go to this salon just to get a gel pedi about 1.5 hrs before close
when -PRON- get there -PRON- politely ask if -PRON- have time to do a gel_manicure too
-PRON- say of_course with no hesitation
the lady do an exceptional job and even stay 30_minute after close to finish up on -PRON- pedicure
if -PRON- have have gel do before -PRON- know -PRON- take a little long to cure each coat under the uv lamp
-PRON- be very happy and satisfied with the result -PRON- be very_nice and -PRON- definitely_recommend_this_place
-PRON- have love -PRON- experience at aaai
dr. mittel and team be seriously world class
-PRON- be so friendly from the moment that -PRON- walk_in to the moment that -PRON- leave
on the first_visit -PRON- perform a breathing test and allergy test to get a baseline for treatment
then dr. mittel go_through all of -PRON- option for treatment base_on the result
unfortunately -PRON- be allergic to just about everything so the smart long_term plan for -PRON- be allergy shot
-PRON- begin -PRON- a few_week_ago and have be go 2x per week
the shot be super quick and easy
-PRON- walk_in get the shot and wait for 30_minute for -PRON- to check -PRON- out
no appointment necessary
-PRON- have wifi in the wait area
so -PRON- just bring -PRON- laptop and get thing do while -PRON- be wait
-PRON- work nicely
if -PRON- can come mid morning before the after school rush -PRON- would_highly suggest that
-PRON- would_highly_recommend aaai and dr. mittel
the practice be super clean convenient and all in all a 5-star experience
cool delicious healthy and creative food and drink

call and be able_to schedule a time right_away which be cool
take -PRON- down and although funky the place be full of car
-PRON- check in and be tell -PRON- would be an_hour or so and the good place to wait be subway across the street
only have to wait an_hour vwfore -PRON- call to say -PRON- be ready
do a great_job and the headlight cleaning look great
-PRON- then show where -PRON- have a small radiator leak and give -PRON- a reasonable estimate on the work
-PRON- have not take -PRON- back as -PRON- be get more estimate but the estimate tony 's gave be comparable to other place
-PRON- be very happy with the work -PRON- have do there and the staff be very pleasant
this be the best salon in_las_vegas
-PRON- have try other salon with horrible customer_service and poor styling service but -PRON- have be go to chloe spa for over a year with no_problem
-PRON- get gel nail
-PRON- last a long_time and look great
the pedicure here be sooo relaxing

the owner and -PRON- daughter greet and welcome each guest and make -PRON- feel at home
very sweet and kind staff
-PRON- schedule an_appointment so -PRON- have have to wait
and -PRON- have be out of the salon soon
-PRON- love this salon
excellent food
great atmosphere
terrible service
there be less_than 10 patron in the whole restaurant so -PRON- be not an_issue of be busy
-PRON- server do_not tell -PRON- about the drink special
-PRON- order and appetizer when -PRON- do_not come_out before -PRON- food
-PRON- ask if -PRON- still want -PRON-
-PRON- say no -PRON- do_not
another server tell -PRON- about the drink special where -PRON- get to keep the glass
when -PRON- ask -PRON- server -PRON- say that -PRON- do_not think -PRON- could keep the glass
-PRON- keep forget to bring -PRON- thing -PRON- need
when the salad do_not have dress -PRON- take 2 trip back to the table before -PRON- remember to bring -PRON-
when -PRON- ask for -PRON- bill the appetizer be still on the bill
luckily a manager attempt to right the wrong and make -PRON- happy
the bill be correct
the manager apologize and -PRON- get to keep the glass
-PRON- will return to this_establishment in hope that the service be good next_time
3.5_star
perhaps because -PRON- expect more from wolfgang puck 's restaurant specifically in regard to the service
ambiance be nice
verry classy place to have dinner at ceasar 's
-PRON- group_of girl be very unique for this restaurant because everyone_else be old and less asian
-PRON- waitress be mia the entire time
-PRON- see -PRON- once when -PRON- take -PRON- order and once when -PRON- pay the bill
in between there be many_other that serve and check up on -PRON-
-PRON- also take a very long_time for -PRON- food to come_out which surprise -PRON- for a restaurant like this
food be pretty_good
-PRON- order the duck breast medium
didn't know -PRON- could order -PRON- like that and try many of the other dish
-PRON- fill -PRON- up on bread but do_not_waste -PRON- space on any_other bread besides the focaccia
duck breast-
-PRON- really like duck but be not impressed_with the duck breast
-PRON- be not bad but not fantastic
filet mignon-
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- can go_wrong_with steak
-PRON- be pretty_good but also just typical tasting
braised beef short rib- extremely tender
many of the girl like this dish the good but personally -PRON- do_not like the texture of very soft beef
if that be -PRON- style then get this
lamb chops-
-PRON- be not a huge_fan_of lamb but surprisingly this be -PRON- favorite dish
the seasoning complement the lamb very well and the meat -PRON- be not too gamey
all in all a really nice dinner
-PRON- would come again for the food but would appreciate the food to come_out faster and more attention from -PRON- waitress vs the other waiters\/server in such a snazzy place
-PRON- first go here at the recommendation of a friend and -PRON- be not disappoint
-PRON- drink be good
even the hot_chocolate be yummy
-PRON- will say this be not an in and out coffee place
-PRON- definitely have to wait a while for -PRON- drink and -PRON- pay lovely attention to -PRON- latte art
with that -PRON- would expect the seating to be good
-PRON- have a bunch_of large table set_up but nothing really for just a_few people to relax
so -PRON- have to wait for -PRON- drink and there often be not anywhere to really_enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- also could do a little good job police -PRON- storefront as there have be a man of late who always ask for change right out front in an affronting manner
but -PRON- be really good coffee and once -PRON- be inside
-PRON- be fine
and -PRON- can get on to -PRON- coffee experience
-PRON- have very high_expectation for this_place and be let down
pluses
-PRON- be able_to have a table 15_minute prior to -PRON- reserved time escargot be
good water be cold service be good
-PRON- have the steak vogue and find -PRON- to be very tasteless do_not even have the natural beef flavor a flat iron steak be know for
ask for medium_rare and -PRON- be close to rare any_other cut
this would not bother -PRON- but a flat iron cut need that little extra cook time
-PRON- be serve with the vogue fries which be nothing_special
wife enjoy -PRON- martini and crime brûlée but be not impressed_with -PRON- filet
really have high hope this would be a convenient close place for special date_night
but -PRON- will only go_back when -PRON- want escargot in a pinch
expect to drop no less_than $_100 for two people depend_on drinks\/dessert of_course
appetizer come_out_quickly but so do the food which be not a horrible thing
but -PRON- be not finish with -PRON- app
and -PRON- entree be be drop_off
-PRON- feel_like the server need to keep a close eye on the other staff bring the food out and have -PRON- hold -PRON- for a moment to time thing good
so overall not impressed especially for the coin
-PRON- have not be to benihana 's in a while -PRON- never really have a complaint about -PRON-
-PRON- be satify
this_place though be awesome
the food be very_tasty the drink be incredibly full of liquor not stingy at all
-PRON- order sushi before -PRON- dinner and the tuna be super fresh
by_far the good benihana 's -PRON- have be too
a definite place to go next_time -PRON- be in_vegas
-PRON- have four hour till -PRON- flight in cleveland oh jeez and be overjoyed to find a lounge
the place be clean modern look and very quiet -PRON- think there be maybe five other people in there
free_wifi power outlet everywhere and a bar
-PRON- get in free with -PRON- amex platinum and get a $_7 credit against drink
so that be more_than -PRON- normally get in lounge
really happy to have a quiet place to work and relax
whenever -PRON- go to vegas -PRON- always either stop_by the bellagio_buffet or the wynn buffet
neither of -PRON- ever disappoint
great cut of meat cocktail shrimp and king_crab leg
-PRON- eat pretty_much the same stuff at every buffet in_vegas but -PRON- be the quality that count
wynn be the good but bellagio be a close second
-PRON- be not cheap but -PRON- be in_vegas splurge a little
start_off great until a year into grooming
-PRON- guess once -PRON- be establish -PRON- do_not_care as much
no reply and miscommunication on appointment date and time
a_few time -PRON- barely even get groom bc of a conversation -PRON- have have about intermittent grooming bc -PRON- get mat easily and rarely get -PRON- nail clip
love -PRON-
and -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- dog do too but can_not seem to get any service
this be -PRON- guilty pleasure
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- eat_here
at_least_once a week
all of the server be lay_back but fast and friendly
the cornish pasties be amazing
-PRON- have try many but -PRON- go to be always the ruben
if -PRON- like ruben sandwich the ruben pasty will blow -PRON- mind
-PRON- mouth be water just think about -PRON-
cheer
this pizza be truly incredible
fresh_ingredient thick slice and the staff be friendly and helpful
-PRON- be outdated and lack amenity
there be not enough plug in the room which be very inconvenient when travel for business
the room be small -PRON- be wear out and everything be just meh
get_rid_of the owner idiotic son
-PRON- know which one patron
and -PRON- may have something
not worth delve any further
walk_in at 11:30am on sunday 4\/23 for a snack
no hot food at all
very annoying
without hot food ampm be just another run of the mill gas_station
randomly stumble_upon this ayce joint just before go to a buddy 's xmas party
the restaurant be pretty small can probably only seat about_10 12 table
the quality of the sashimi and sushi_roll be surprisingly good for a mid town sushi joint
-PRON- go to salmon sashimi however be not as fresh as other place which -PRON- can generally tell by the colour of the salmon not as orange
if -PRON- be in the area again and crave sushi would still hit up this spot good value for the money and food be descent
-PRON- be really exciting to see new local brewery pop_up in pittsburgh
-PRON- go to a group meeting event hear and be able_to sample all of -PRON- beer and receive a tasting class for $_10 and get a tour of the facility
the guy work there be very_friendly and knowledgeable_about -PRON- beer
-PRON- have a nice range of different variety and have a really interesting unique beer that taste_like a slightly sour wheat cherry beer that be quite good
and -PRON- normally do_not even like sour beer or cherry flavor drink
-PRON- only have beer sample and growler for sale with no food yet
but -PRON- be plan on expand to have food soon
great for togo
-PRON- order from here for -PRON- office meeting yesterday
-PRON- be very_helpful over the phone
plus -PRON- be the first place that when -PRON- call -PRON- before -PRON- open -PRON- do_not give -PRON- attitude about order early
yes -PRON- understand that -PRON- do_not open for another hour but if -PRON- could please take -PRON- order so that -PRON- can make_sure -PRON- be ready in and hour and a half -PRON- would appreciate -PRON-
do -PRON- really need to explain this to people
annoying
anyway -PRON- do_not need to have that convo with -PRON- at all take -PRON- order and let -PRON- know if would be ready exactly when -PRON- want -PRON- and -PRON- be
the quality be good the salad dressing be great and -PRON- do_not_skimp_on the pizza topping
-PRON- be a little_pricey almost $_20 per 16 pizza but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- think
especially_since -PRON- be not pay for -PRON-
haha
-PRON- husband have a strategic planning meeting at this resort for the association -PRON- work for
this mean -PRON- have to be in board meeting for 2 day hear what -PRON- have do well and wrong for the past year and what be go to go on this coming year
and -PRON- get to hang_out with a bunch_of lady and eat drink and lie by the pool
-PRON- be a really lovely trip
i'm sure -PRON- have more fun than -PRON- do
anywho the good thing_about this hotel be the room be really nice the staff be really nice and the pool(s be be amazing
the bad thing be the smokey casino lobby and the general hub bub go on down there
overall really wonderful time
-PRON- would go_back just to hang by the pool
-PRON- husband -PRON- 1 yr old and -PRON- just have dinner there
while -PRON- be there early than_most ppl eat dinner the service be fast and the restaurant be perfect for bring -PRON- son
-PRON- get a gf pizza which be amazing
the crust be not rock hard or grainy-
-PRON- be hard to tell -PRON- be even gf
-PRON- half have the daiya cheese -PRON- husband have normal cheese
-PRON- make_sure the cheese do_not touch w\/o be ask to
-PRON- will_definitely be back
-PRON- be a former barista so -PRON- be very picky about -PRON- coffee
nothing can touch this_place the love care flavor and aroma be in every sip
good coffee -PRON- have ever taste in -PRON- life
on only -PRON- second_visit not only be -PRON- remember but so be -PRON- drink order
the effort be in every sip
the price be a pleasant surprise and -PRON- even have soy milk
ok -PRON- have never see the show these owner be on and do_not_know the story behind the bakery but decide to try this_place because -PRON- be by -PRON- house
-PRON- be skeptical to pay_$ 3.00 for one cupcake
to -PRON- surprise -PRON- love -PRON- and since then have try a variety_of -PRON- cupcake
-PRON- favorite include the director chocolate_cake with chocolate buttercream frosting and -PRON- german chocolate_cake which be make for only certain time
-PRON- have buy -PRON- cupcake for friend and coworker
and -PRON- all find -PRON- moist flavorful and delicious
-PRON- do have cookie and cake pop as_well_as a_few other thing
but -PRON- have only stick with the cupcake
-PRON- favorite cupcake place
overall the service here be impeccable
the view if -PRON- be able_to get a seat over lake bellagio be even good
-PRON- be very difficult to find a good charcuterie place on the strip and -PRON- would have to say that this_place be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- recommendation be that -PRON- go early to get a good table and also indulge in the appetizers\/drink
-PRON- can_not imagine how crowd this_place must be on the weekend but -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- go on a weeknight and be able_to get a table easily
food
-PRON- do seem to -PRON- that -PRON- pay a premium on the food due_to the fact_that the view from the restaurant be absolutely beautiful
however -PRON- be not_sure if that be a fair judgement base_on the fact_that -PRON- be not able_to try everything on the menu
-PRON- boyfriend have the stroganoff the special and -PRON- have the butternut squash
of_course -PRON- also have charcuterie which if -PRON- could -PRON- would give a 10\/5
ambiance
while the yelp_review list that the restaurant be casual -PRON- do see some nicely dress individual during -PRON- dinner
-PRON- think -PRON- can get away with business casual especially if -PRON- be intend on set outside
the bellagio water show be absolutely stunning to watch from the outside patio especially_during sunset
the restaurant also offer photography for purchase for anyone sit outdoors but -PRON- boyfriend
and -PRON- find that the waiter do a great_job of capture the moment for -PRON- on -PRON- iphones yay technology
service
if the review be base_on service alone -PRON- would give the restaurant a 10\/5
the server -PRON- have whose name be ann be absolutely wonderful and kind
when -PRON- leave the restaurant -PRON- boyfriend
and -PRON- encounter a small health incident and the staff at the restaurant be responsive attentive and so kind

after a long day of travel and work -PRON- come_here for dinner and have a delicious half pound burger with grill mushroom swiss cheese crispy bacon fresh produce feature onion lettuce tomato and a delicious dill pickle that snookie would salivate over
with -PRON- entree -PRON- be give the option of a side of fry curly_fry or onion_ring

-PRON- go to yasu in september 2015
-PRON- would give this_place a 4 when compare to sushi restaurant in other city but give that -PRON- be in_toronto -PRON- be definitely a 5
-PRON- be a small and cosy place with friendly_staff
the fish be fresh and of high_quality
the omakase include 16 piece_of various sushi 1 maki and 1 handroll
try to get a seat at the bar watch the chef do -PRON- thing be pretty fun
absolutely perfect
-PRON- be by -PRON- just come in from out of town be drive all night set_up a booth in_vegas and drop_off a trailer near by need food and a drink
perfect atmosphere to sit in a dimly light bar have a cheesesteak and have john serve up some drink w\/ a smile
just what -PRON- need
food be good but only if -PRON- be stay for the buffet if -PRON- be get the thali 's for takeout -PRON- do_not ever fill the container
-PRON- paneer dish have one small peice of paneer -PRON- kadi with pakora have no pakora
good thing be to eat there
even_though -PRON- hate to say -PRON- because -PRON- will probably make -PRON- hard for -PRON- to see -PRON-
nick be the good
-PRON- be one of the good massage therapist -PRON- have ever go to in -PRON- life
-PRON- always kick -PRON- when -PRON- try to cut corner and go to someone_else when -PRON- be not available because -PRON- never end_up happy
-PRON- be attentive listen to what -PRON- want and deliver every_time
massage_envy be lucky to have -PRON- because -PRON- be top_notch
incredible mansion perfect for special_occasion and fancy dinner
the food be truly delicious
-PRON- need to wait 30-something minute at the bar for -PRON- table if -PRON- do_not have the reservation but -PRON- be totally_worth -PRON-
-PRON- will be back for sure
can service be too attentive
-PRON- love that the restaurant be spacious clean and modern
love the many side -PRON- give and the quality of the meat this and hobak definitely have the good meat quality in all of the korean bbq place and decent pricing too
but -PRON- be so annoyed be there to the point where -PRON- could_not have a conversation with -PRON- friend
-PRON- have about 4 different server take_care_of -PRON-
-PRON- would think this be awesome and service should be beyond expectation
but no
-PRON- be -PRON- first_time there
so -PRON- need time to look over the menu
-PRON- ask the first server to give -PRON- some time then 2 other server come by want to take -PRON- order so -PRON- have to ask for more time again
then -PRON- friend want picture of some of the dish so -PRON- tell one of the server that -PRON- can cook the meat -PRON-
-PRON- let -PRON- be but the other server keep come by ask -PRON- if -PRON- be sure -PRON- want to do -PRON- -PRON-
then -PRON- friend want to cut the pork_belly before -PRON- be fully cook so -PRON- can cook more quickly but a server come by and rudely ask -PRON- cut before -PRON- cook then -PRON- take over with the meat and tell -PRON- do_not cut ok
seriously
-PRON- ask to be leave alone and -PRON- keep come over act_like -PRON- do_not_know_how to grill meat
the same guy come_back and keep cook -PRON- meat and be put meat that -PRON- do_not want onto -PRON- plate so -PRON- can cook more meat
-PRON- keep come over and be in -PRON- face -PRON- have to stop -PRON- conversation every_time -PRON- come by
-PRON- get -PRON- that -PRON- be try to give -PRON- good service -PRON- be try to cook the meat for -PRON- and -PRON- really nice of -PRON-
but -PRON- should let -PRON- be when -PRON- ask for -PRON- multiple_time
-PRON- friend and -PRON- prefer to cook -PRON- own meat so -PRON- can eat at -PRON- own_pace
these server keep come by and cook meat continuously and -PRON- feel_rush to eat -PRON- all before -PRON- be over cook
-PRON- really should not have too_many people work the same table and -PRON- clearly do_not communicate with each_other since -PRON- have to repeat -PRON- multiple_time
the staff here be way_too aggressive
-PRON- be as if -PRON- get annoy that -PRON- be cook -PRON- own meat
-PRON- really_enjoy the food good meat quality and a great variety_of side_dish
but when -PRON- have a meal -PRON- like to be able_to talk to -PRON- friend
-PRON- like to eat at -PRON- own_pace
and -PRON- generally like to be leave alone so -PRON- could comfortably eat
this_place be way_too aggressive with -PRON- serve style and -PRON- be borderline rush -PRON- to finish -PRON- meal and be rude
-PRON- love sonic but the food at_this_location be not quite as good as other
this_location be not in the good area of town for -PRON- out of towner
-PRON- do get fast service though
silvia be an_amazing server and food be exceptional
-PRON- will be back again and again and again
the carne_asada dinner be perfect
drink be amazing
awesome decor and cool vibe
sooooo impressed
-PRON- have be go to this fuddrucker
's since early 09 and -PRON- hope that all of the issue that tara m. bring up in -PRON- review have be address -PRON- seem fairly clean in the ten or so visit -PRON- have make this year
-PRON- dig -PRON- burger legit fresh quality ground beef cook up on the spot work for -PRON-
the bun be delectable and a perfect compliment
nice condiment bar with a good selection of choice and big seasoned fry wedge style round thing out nicely
yes the interior be kinda kitschy and tacky long_overdue for an update or total remodel and the exterior be pretty dated but -PRON- do_not come_here for those thing
-PRON- be a little on the pricey side but -PRON- be willing_to throw down a_few extra buck for the quality of food which have be very consistent here
this -PRON- favorite mexican_food place in az
-PRON- burrito be so flavorful and big
no_matter_what -PRON- have get from chilaquiles to the senor burro -PRON- have be fantastic
-PRON- family be very picky and -PRON- can all agree on senor taco
-PRON- make -PRON- second_visit to taco mac with a small group_of friend
the beer_selection rate 5_star the food rate 2_star
great place to watch sport event
there must be 75 flat_screen in this_establishment
a number_of the table in the bar_area have -PRON- own tapper right at the table
-PRON- just start pour and a counter keep track of -PRON- consumption
no wait for the server to order another round
great place to go with a group
the appetizer and the one entree -PRON- order be a dissapointment
-PRON- look_like a neighborhood bike shop which -PRON- think be very cool
look in the window -PRON- see old 10 speed and the like
-PRON- say look in the window because -PRON- never get into the shop no one be there
after_read other yelp_review -PRON- realize this be a small shop with weird hour
-PRON- call about 9_a.m. and ask what the hour for that day be 10 7
-PRON- get there at 10:15 and no one be there
ok everyone can run behind at 10:30 -PRON- go to the restaurant next to the bike shop for a snack at 10:45
-PRON- still be not there and -PRON- phone be go to voice mail
-PRON- guess if -PRON- go there go on the weekend do_not count on -PRON- be there even if -PRON- call_ahead to confirm
the reason -PRON- be a two and not a one be because -PRON- answer the phone at 9_a.m.
very good customer_service
everyone go out of -PRON- way to be helpful
pick_up some nike phoenix shirt
not sanitary
-PRON- go in for a manicure and be disgust at the tool
there be no way -PRON- be disinfect -PRON-
when the manicurist take -PRON- out of -PRON- case -PRON- do_not look clean and after -PRON- use -PRON- on -PRON- -PRON- take one of the tool and swish -PRON- around in the bowl of water that -PRON- have be soak -PRON- fingernail in
the other tool go_back into -PRON- case without be clean
super disgusting
realize that there be sooo many location to get banh mi in_charlotte -PRON- be always reduce to have one choice le 's sandwiches
this sandwich be a staple for -PRON- culture and -PRON- tend_to be picky on where -PRON- go to get -PRON- fix
consider the fact_that this be the only decent location in_charlotte -PRON- review rating will be a little inflated for what -PRON- actually worth
this little small shop in asian corner be a hidden_gem among the busy passerby 's who have not have the chance to snack upon this staple
locally own and operate by a mom and pop the place scream support small business like -PRON-
and that be something -PRON- should definitely do
-PRON- be not only support -PRON- but also get a little taste of vietnam
the bread use here be bake fresh and -PRON- need to come early as -PRON- will usually run out by 4 or 5 pm
ask for -PRON- to be toast
that be a true version with whatev sandwich -PRON- order
-PRON- notice people do_not ask for that and yuck just yuck
-PRON- need -PRON- toast to get that crunch from the bread and boost flavor from the heat
-PRON- usually get -PRON- special for $ 4.00 which in all honesty be a little high
the meat be slice in standard affair and depend_on which sandwich -PRON- can have a bland taste to tastebud popping when -PRON- chew on a pepper corn
however -PRON- have be cut down on -PRON- meat quality and put more liver patte and lard in
veggie of_course be fresh and the jalapeno pepper be guarantee to make -PRON- sweat
service be friendly and be sure to bring cash folk
-PRON- do_not_accept cc like many asian store
for what -PRON- be worth in_charlotte -PRON- can get a decent vietnamese sandwich here
great fresh_ingredient
tasty beef taco and burrito
fresh_ingredient better_than chipotle
do a take out brunch and -PRON- enjoy the food
very affordable with price much low than other restaurant serve brunch
the place have more of a coffee shop feel to -PRON- and -PRON- be not too big
worth_check_out
hi kann man die geburtstunden des automobils förmlich spüren und_die modelle und pläne bewundern
echt interessant und ein
muss für auto fans
-PRON- go there with -PRON- bf out of curiosity
hear a lot about the chain and to be fair -PRON- do_not expect a whole lot after_read review and eat raman at other place in_toronto sansotei santouka nobuya kinton toubouken and rajin ramen
-PRON- order the tonkatsu miso ramen while -PRON- bf order the king of king raman
-PRON- find -PRON- tonkatsu miso_raman to be decent
-PRON- should not have drink much of the broth as -PRON- be really thirsty for a while and need water
rarely have this problem in the place -PRON- try above
bf do_not enjoy the king of king raman as -PRON- do_not like the broth and -PRON- overall execution
-PRON- also feel -PRON- be not like a traditional japanese raman bowl despite many topping
-PRON- mean -PRON- be surprised at the ground pork and kimchi there
-PRON- find -PRON- broth to be fine though
perhaps -PRON- be -PRON- and -PRON- bf 's preference but -PRON- be not expect that much beansprout and very thin noodle well base_on the thick_noodle -PRON- be use to from other place
service be fine give the limited space and grow number_of client -PRON- come at 11ish opening time and leave at around 11:55
overall 3\/5 star which -PRON- feel be justify
will not mind try this chain again in mississauga or toronto
but -PRON- be not a place -PRON- would go out of -PRON- way for lunch or supper
bf intend to try a more traditional japanese raman bowl there next_time
for -PRON- -PRON- probably may give shio a shot along_with the takoyaki
those look huge
great place jerry super cool guy good music playin
great work color really pop on -PRON- work strongly recommend to anyone look for quality work
classy joint second_floor patio have a great atmosphere but be small so go early to grab a table
-PRON- prefer the oxley as there be a_bit_more room and the location be nice but really -PRON- can_not go_wrong_with either one
the new restaurant on green street be great
the vegasm be delicious as be the parm truffle tot
can_not wait for -PRON- to be open for later hour for some much need drunk munchie
same quality of food and price as the truck
-PRON- have be to this_location twice_now both great experience
both time be to fix -PRON- tire and get -PRON- patch up due_to a nail
-PRON- be really write this for the customer_service as_soon_as -PRON- walk_in -PRON- be greet and tell -PRON- will be right with -PRON- as_soon_as -PRON- can_not be ignore
as -PRON- be be walk_out to -PRON- truck the employee hold a door open for a customer who be walk towards the entrance
the other aspect of service -PRON- witness which be great
2 girl come in act kind_of ditzy say -PRON- run over something and ask the employee behind the counter to look_at the tire to see if everything be ok
the employee do_not talk down to -PRON- or try to make -PRON- feel stupid that be why the 5_star
-PRON- be that kind_of service give respect to every customer that go a long way
-PRON- have be think about join this good life location strictly for the fact_that -PRON- have a pool
-PRON- finally get around to get a 7 day trial membership to try -PRON- out this past week
-PRON- habit be to swim first thing in the morning which have some impact on -PRON- experience
the good
the pool be saltwater
if -PRON- be sensitive to chlorine this be ideal since saltwater be less harsh on the skin
the hour be great 6 am to 10 pm
usually pool have very_limited hour for lane swimming
pool only membership be available for about half the price of a full membership
the bad
the pool be short at 20 yard
once -PRON- get start -PRON- be already at the other end
-PRON- have be spoil by swim in 25 m pool -PRON- guess
there be on 4 lane 5 if -PRON- count the one with the build in step
the lane be narrow and can_not be share
as a result only 4 or 5 people can swim at a time in the pool
there be a courtesy time limit of 20_minute
there be often 7 am class
-PRON- either have to get -PRON- swimming in before 7 am or after 8 am
there be no line on the bottom of the pool
kind_of disorienting but maybe not a_bit deal since -PRON- can_not share lane
in the end -PRON- decide not to join
-PRON- be glad to be able_to try -PRON- out
that be not true of every gym
plan_ahead on -PRON- visit here
-PRON- can be very exclusive seating
the food be totally_worth the price
-PRON- be never disappointed when -PRON- visit here
also be prepared to be fullll when -PRON- leave
-PRON- serve veggie and bread before -PRON- real meal come
-PRON- be stuff beyond measure and -PRON- pant know -PRON-
unfortunately -PRON- do_not think sweatpant would have be appropriate attire
but -PRON- need -PRON- when -PRON- leave
if -PRON- like -PRON- then -PRON- shoulda put an egg on -PRON-
seriously throw an egg on -PRON- phenomenal fresh ground bison burger
-PRON- be always a fan_of krayvings but -PRON- first few visit -PRON- be not into the ipad ordering system
-PRON- decide to customize -PRON- meal this morning and -PRON- truly do add to the experience
the touchscreen give -PRON- plenty_of great option especially if -PRON- be particular with -PRON- diet
-PRON- go for the bison burger minus the brioche bun which -PRON- be sure be great and add fontine cheese spicy aoli and egg- lettuce_wrap style
first_bite be a damn that be good
moment
the meat be perfectly season and juicy with a delicious outer char
the carmelized onion bring -PRON- home big time
the staff be great and -PRON- server take the time to tell -PRON- all about how -PRON- meal be prepare which -PRON- always appreciate
be sure to try out -PRON- smoothie too the pb nutella be -PRON- personal fav
keep up the good job krayvings
first_time here due_to the lure from groupon
the presentation of the sushi_roll be very poor the sushi be just throw on an ugly white plate no garnish nothing
the roll be not tight and the rice fall_apart when -PRON- put in soy_sauce
the sushi -PRON- self be not to bad
but -PRON- have have way way better
-PRON- glass be dirty and be waiter nail be dirty
yuck

-PRON- also get the fry_rice which be not on the menu
but -PRON- ask and -PRON- say the would make -PRON- special
so delicious
overall wonderful service delicious food good drink and at a reasonable_price

the dessert be a little heavy than what -PRON- expect but for a night out -PRON- be doable
the service be great as_well
-PRON- be very_friendly check back on -PRON- table often to make_sure everything be good and if -PRON- need refill on -PRON- drink
all in all a very good place to go for a night out
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come_back to every once in a while
this hotel be just fine
nothing_spectacular and price accordingly
most of the staff be friendly
downtown vegas be great place to visit
-PRON- be just not_sure -PRON- would stay in this area again
in the future -PRON- think i''ll just bite the bullet and stay up town at one of the many luxury hotel and cab -PRON- to fremont section for one evening
not try to be a snob but the crowd be a little on the rough side
this be a smoker paradise
-PRON- give -PRON- a flavor of what -PRON- must have be like 20 year_ago in society
unfortunately -PRON- be not smoker
so -PRON- be a little bothering
again -PRON- be good value but as the saying go -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- can_not begin to say how disappointed -PRON- be with this_place
-PRON- like small business and everyone be very_friendly however after several visit and close to $ 1,000 later -PRON- stereo still be not fix and -PRON- never do diagnose -PRON- correctly
with the limited supply of stereo equipment to_choose_from -PRON- be not able_to correctly work with oem stereo equipment
the trouble start with the volume continually fluctuate
-PRON- diagnose -PRON- as a bad tato unit and replace -PRON-
not once but three_time
finally say -PRON- be not that now -PRON- be the amplifier that -PRON- would replace for only $ 800 and by the way -PRON- be go to need to new subwoofer
take -PRON- elsewhere replace the stereo not the amp and sub and -PRON- work fine
so as nice as everyone be -PRON- be not qualified to diagnose\/fix everything
-PRON- have a 2004 4 runner not some exotic car
come_here after_read good review while -PRON- be work in the area
customer_service be polite and efficient
menu be clean and simple
sandwich be excellent
have be here_twice and would come_back here anytime -PRON- get the chance
great shake
will have to try the bowl next_time or the burger
-PRON- both look amazing
this be probably the good boba tea place in_vegas
at_least top 3
all the employee here be so nice
this_place be always so busy and there be a reason_why
-PRON- love the taro milk_tea because -PRON- use real taro
-PRON- get -PRON- less sweet but the regular sweetness be just fine
-PRON- be not that -PRON- be overly_sweet -PRON- be just -PRON- personal preference
-PRON- have have the sweet crepe here before too
and -PRON- be just as delicious
-PRON- want to try the taro slush because -PRON- put real taro as a topping
but -PRON- just love -PRON- over ice too_much
great concept here
love_this_place
bad oriental food -PRON- have have
expensive too
only one oriental looking guy work there
the veggie noodle -PRON- get be not good
hardly no veggie in -PRON-
noodle be very thick and have a weird bland taste
-PRON- have to soak -PRON- with soy_sauce just so -PRON- could eat -PRON-
-PRON- hubby ask for a side of white_rice and -PRON- want 6.99 for -PRON-
so hubby decline
soup be good
-PRON- know that mythical hole_in the wall sushi place the one run by a local proprietor and serve delicious food at reasonable_price that no one ever know about
this be that place
-PRON- can_not say enough good thing_about this_establishment
first_off the sushi be top rate
now -PRON- be not say that -PRON- be japan sushi sensei level good but -PRON- be consistently excellent and very unexpected for the neighborhood
the fish be fresh the rice be tasty the portion be generous for sushi
there be both japanese and korean entree available as_well
but the good thing have to be the price -PRON- be happy_hour every_day mean that for $_5 -PRON- can get a las_vegas roll and for $_7 -PRON- can get a rainbow_roll
chirashi only set -PRON- back $_11
and edamame be complimentary
seating be limit due_to the fact_that this be indeed a real hole_in the wall so -PRON- can get crowd on weekend
by_far -PRON- favorite sushi establishment this side of the valley
there be clearly a problem with -PRON- employee in -PRON- postal service
-PRON- be all for hire the elderly but many of -PRON- be unable or struggle to accurately perform the job
-PRON- have have three prior mailing of package that be not correctly inputt into the system and be either lose or never arrive
-PRON- have to go down to the post_office on via ventura to resolve the issue
-PRON- be clear that on all three_time -PRON- be due_to error by the postal clerk
-PRON- quit mail there for that reason
well yesterday -PRON- decide to give -PRON- another try
the clerk be really slow and seem to be struggle
-PRON- be not until -PRON- get home that -PRON- look_at -PRON- tracking slip
-PRON- mark the slip as destination irvine california
the package be be send to florida
so -PRON- check the tracking number this morning and -PRON- be not even in the system
-PRON- drop -PRON- off yesterday morning
unbelievable
back to the post_office to try and resolve this and find -PRON- package
these employee be unable to accurately perform -PRON- duty
-PRON- be go to file a formal complaint with the postal service
-PRON- need to be hold to the same standard and training as regular postal worker
save -PRON- the time and frustration and use the regular post_office
these_guy just remove 10 large tree from -PRON- yard
fili and -PRON- crew do excellent work
-PRON- be a big job but -PRON- knock -PRON- out quickly and clean up the yard very well
luis be great to work with knowledgeable and professional and always quick to respond to -PRON- text
-PRON- will_definitely be use -PRON- in the future for all of -PRON- outdoor project
-PRON- dog come in for a visit to this clinic with an ear infection which should have be a simple fix
the vet here claim a special test be need to determine the type_of infection more_than one medication be prescribe and -PRON- fail to clean -PRON- ear out
-PRON- end_up pay a_few hundred out of -PRON- pocket that be unnecessary which -PRON- discover after consult another vet since the infection do_not go away
what a waste of -PRON- money for poor and dishonest service
-PRON- be excited when -PRON- see there be a sport bar\/gastropub in -PRON- hotel
craft burger and beer whilst watch the sunday_night football_game awesome
immediately -PRON- could see that the sense of urgency within the restaurant be poor -PRON- be sunday at 1830hrs
and -PRON- be nearly 50 to capacity so
maybe that have something to do with -PRON-
-PRON- order -PRON- public house burger both medium temp at $_17 each with add bacon on one for $_2 extra
twenty 20_minute_later no burger
when -PRON- inquire with -PRON- server -PRON- be tell the kitchen be back up and no time give as to how_much longer until -PRON- ask then -PRON- say about_10 more minute as if that be just the norm
speak to a manager and -PRON- go to investigate seven 7 minute_later -PRON- be get -PRON- burger
that be thirty 30_minute for burger oh
and -PRON- be medium
well not medium pink all the way_through as be iterate upon order -PRON-
the food be not only late -PRON- be cook to the incorrect temperature -PRON- eat -PRON- as -PRON- do_not want to wait another 30_minute
the brioche bun be very fresh and yummy the fry be crunchy and season well
-PRON- request ranch to go with the fry and -PRON- be tell -PRON- be 50¢ ok
that be fine no big_deal
just to note if -PRON- be go to charge for condiment the quality assurance for -PRON- other dressing should be great the caesar dress for the side salad be oily and runny hence -PRON- be break the oil be no_longer emulsify by the egg yolk and dijon
hospitality here be very poor -PRON- do_not feel_like guest at public house more like people_who -PRON- have to deal with because -PRON- walk_in
the barista be always exceptionally rude
cafe kopi have good coffee and a friendly vibe
while -PRON- do love bahama bucks -PRON- do_not like this_location
the hour -PRON- say that -PRON- will be open seem 50\/50 if -PRON- actually be open
which seem to be a common problem from other yelper -PRON- see
well -PRON- be still a problem as of today 4\/13\/2014
after_read other yelp_review -PRON- know this be a must_try spot
-PRON- go in with little expectation for the wait staff but -PRON- be pleasantly_surprised
-PRON- name be take down -PRON- be show where -PRON- could wait and only wait about ten_minute for a table
-PRON- server be as sweet as could be and get -PRON- drink and bread right_away
if -PRON- have to leave after the bread and dip oil -PRON- would have be ridiculously happy
the bread come_out pip_hot and the dipping oil be good_than anything -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- order soup which come_out right_away and be tasty
-PRON- meal come_out only a few_minute after -PRON- finish -PRON- soup and -PRON- be not disappoint
-PRON- get the rita pasta and -PRON- husband have the sarafino pasta both of which be incredible
-PRON- feel out of place because -PRON- be the only table in the restaurant without a bottle or two of wine
so -PRON- will_definitely be take a bottle next_time
-PRON- go
theresa never_fail to make -PRON- eyebrow look good
-PRON- be so sweet and out go
-PRON- do_not go to anyone_else but
-PRON-
and -PRON- definitely trust -PRON- with -PRON- eyebrow haha
-PRON- daughter and -PRON- go in for gel_manicure and regular pedicure
-PRON- use the valpak coupon
two man take_care_of -PRON- and an_old lady
-PRON- be very kind speak_english and do an_excellent job
-PRON- cuticle have never look good
-PRON- also have a pleasant conversation with -PRON- nail_tech about asian food
-PRON- show_up after 6_p.m. -PRON- close at 7 but finish -PRON- nail and another lady too and stay until almost 7:30 without rush -PRON- out
-PRON- take -PRON- time and do -PRON- nail right
-PRON- be not a fancy place but since -PRON- be a_bit south of happy valley -PRON- do_not run into the packed nail_salon where -PRON- rush and do_not do as great of a job like -PRON- would if -PRON- go to a salon at happy valley and lake pleasant
thank for the great nail
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- have be to smith bros steakhouse a couple time
-PRON- steak be decent and price be reasonable
-PRON- order filet_mignon $ 33 rib eye steak $_35 seafood sirloin $ 32 and new_york strips $_30
out of the 4 -PRON- personally like filet_mignon the most because -PRON- be very tender but -PRON- parent like the rib eye better
-PRON- wish seafood sauce can be one of the option
overall good experience and worth -PRON- money
the coffee from all that jazz have great coffee and that be easily what be most_important for -PRON- in a cafe
-PRON- usually just get the coffee but sometimes get the latte or cappuccino and the iced americano in the summer
-PRON- have also start bring in more food on the menu some -PRON- seem to make there like sandwich and
some -PRON- bring in from dufflet's
-PRON- think
inside be quite spacious with ample seating that can usually guarantee -PRON- a spot
-PRON- be also get nice big window with lot_of natural light and jazz continuously play
-PRON- be a good spot to enjoy a coffee and a bite or just grab a cup of joe to go
this_place be horrible
-PRON- initially use -PRON- since -PRON- start in real_estate in 1997
never have any problem until -PRON- last order which take over a month for -PRON- to complete
-PRON- have to constantly call and be just give the run_around and transfer to a different person each_time
-PRON- do_not_know_what be go on at this_place
but -PRON- do_not conduct business in a professional manner
-PRON- finally lose -PRON- after call to check on -PRON- order which be promise to be do on a certain day again
the manager threaten to cancel -PRON- order and hang_up_on -PRON-
grant
-PRON- be yell_at -PRON- but before that -PRON- have be more_than patient and understanding
the order do finally get do after -PRON- scream at -PRON- but -PRON- will be -PRON- last with -PRON-
besides all this -PRON- price be not the good around
-PRON- have all -PRON- art work so -PRON- be a simple order with no change
-PRON- do_not_know_what to really expect when -PRON- come_here but -PRON- see a picture of saimin the day before
and -PRON- know that -PRON- just have to go
-PRON- get here a lil before 11 be
and -PRON- be pretty packed
-PRON- order the deluxe saimin and sub -PRON- out with udon noodle instead
everything come_out fairly_quickly
broth be light and there be a good assortment_of wonton bbq_pork and imitation crab meat
-PRON- do_not leave full though so that be the downfall
-PRON- coworker enjoy the teriyaki chicken which -PRON- eat all of
-PRON- know -PRON- will be back to get some chantilly cake to go
-PRON- have a pastry selection that look pretty delish but can be pricy at $_4.50 a slice
-PRON- be in and out in 30_minute and everyone be quite friendly
-PRON- try this_place the other day for take out while walk past the store
the staff there be so friendly and fun
-PRON- take -PRON- time to explain thing on the menu and give -PRON- -PRON- recommendation
-PRON- be fast service
-PRON- have the drunken beef with the mayo and -PRON- be delicious
the crisp carrot and cucumber make -PRON- so refreshing
-PRON- can_not wait to try other thing on the menu
-PRON- purchase -PRON- vehicle here and that be a great experience but the real win be in the service -PRON- have have for the past_few_year
tom miller be the man and -PRON- always treat -PRON- -PRON- vehicle well
this be the first lexus -PRON- have own
and -PRON- be definitely hooked
every dish with beautifully present and so beautiful
very unique great selection the atmosphere be amazing the service be great
just be ready to pay
the beer education of misti y could have very easily be complete tonight if -PRON- have not have to run off to catch an art show
-PRON- be a beer drinker but nowhere near the connoisseur that frequent ace and ales
there be a special selection of rogue brew on_tap start tonight and the occasion bring_out some deep beer lover avid home brewer the beer meet_up organizer
in_addition to sip the sud on_tap -PRON- bring_out special bottle to share
passion be in the air
because -PRON- be just a lowly drinker -PRON- can_not say that -PRON- be the most qualified to determine the quality of the beer_selection but base_on the survey of the crowd this be the place to be
-PRON- trust -PRON-
-PRON- do mention freakin frog and yardhouse but for straight up quality and not quantity -PRON- agree aces deliver good
-PRON- try the rogue hazelnut
delicious
-PRON- also test a belgian ale
the name escape -PRON- but -PRON- wish -PRON- could have handle an entire glass
-PRON- have to drive
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be starve so -PRON- order some grub
-PRON- be impressed to see a veggie burger on the menu and sweet_potato_fry
the veggie burger be a pretty standard morning star esque patty and -PRON- come on a sesame_seed bun with a nice stack of lettuce onion tomato and pickle
-PRON- be char agreeably
the sweet_potato_fry be a tad salty but -PRON- finish every morsel of sustenance on -PRON- plate
overall -PRON- be a solid offering for bar food
-PRON- would not be afraid to come_here hungry
as for the physical atmosphere the bar be a large clean and comfortable video poker bar with pool_table
nothing trendy or thematic but -PRON- be impressed_by the lack of overbearing smoke and the fact_that one tv station be dedicate to music video on fusetv
plus the co owner be the guitar player for alice cooper
that earn bonus atmosphere point as do the friendly_staff
-PRON- be tear between 4 and 5_star
-PRON- be a sucker for bold interior and aces be a straightforward bar
still -PRON- know that most of the people come_here see everything through beer goggle and if designer one be -PRON- thing then this be 5_star all the way
for specialty beer passion this be as good as -PRON- get in_las_vegas
best egg_roll ever
everything_else -PRON- have have be good too but not the good around
fast delivery and friendly service
-PRON- be clean but small and look run_down
-PRON- take -PRON- dad and -PRON- about fifteen_minute to get a seat on a sunday evening as the restaurant be pack with many family
there be only one table mean for two people so -PRON- have to wait for that one couple to finish -PRON- meal
-PRON- dad and -PRON- order the chow mein and the small assorted gluten platter
-PRON- find that assorted gluten to be a_bit too oily for -PRON- liking but for $ 5.99 the quantity and the great tasting flavour make up for -PRON-
the noodle be pretty_good although the quantity in noodle be a_bit meager in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- also take -PRON- a while to get -PRON- bill
for some_reason -PRON- be wait to give -PRON- to -PRON-
when -PRON- dad ask what be take so long -PRON- say that -PRON- be try to confirm the third dish that -PRON- order and be wait for -PRON- to be serve
when -PRON- dad clarify that -PRON- never order a third dish -PRON- hesitate but then give -PRON- to -PRON- right_away
-PRON- just seem a_bit foolish have to wait for confirmation from the kitchen when -PRON- could have just ask -PRON- directly
great tasting food
questionable service
-PRON- would like to come_back at another time when -PRON- be less busy to give -PRON- another try
nice atmosphere good service nice wine_selection and most_importantly good food
go to dinner with -PRON- wife kid and in law
everyone enjoy -PRON- food
-PRON- waitress be lovely
will_definitely_return
btw
the chocolate lava cake be fantastic
this_place be amazing
i love anywhere with good veggie option and make -PRON- own style
this_place have both
-PRON- veggie patty be delicious
-PRON- be not -PRON- typical bean burger
-PRON- be get some beet in -PRON- give -PRON- a lovely red purple color and something meal y like mash_potato
i really have_no_idea though
but -PRON- be super yummy
also -PRON- can put the veggie patty on any of the suggest burger or make -PRON- own
-PRON- burger be awesome
-PRON- also have the stuff peppadew pepper
-PRON- be really tasty
but -PRON- be not use to the spicy sweet of the peppadew
and last but not least the cocktail be delicious
-PRON- be a_few dollar on the expensive side but still tasty none the less will have to go_back and try more
wish that -PRON- happy_hour include a_few buck off the cocktail
the only_downside the wait staff seem to be a_bit inexperienced
go three_time and all three_time sit wait and wait and wait
oy
all in all will be back since -PRON- have already be back a_few time :p bring down the drink price train -PRON- staff better and keep up the delicious food
food be amazing threat service and great food
nice and clean restaurant
-PRON- have really good drink and food -PRON- would_recommend very chill environment
-PRON- go with a group_of 5 and luckily -PRON- be able_to sit in back
the place be small and bad for group
aside_from that the food be awesome and the beer be cheap
-PRON- grow_up on pasty in wisconsin -PRON- dad 's would be call a beef stew pasty
the variation this_place have be awesome
good stuff

beautiful place
this_place be so pretty
but -PRON- be so -PRON- style too
some may find -PRON- too grandma
-PRON- love the decor
-PRON- go here for dinner at the restaurant mood
the food be good
-PRON- have the filet which be cook as request not too under or overcook
someone in -PRON- party have the scallop which be also cook just right
side order be the mushroom which be -PRON- favorite dish very_tasty
-PRON- also get the brussel_sprout mac and cheese and the french_fry
all be ok
not incredibly impressive
-PRON- get the crab_cake bruschetta and margarita flatbread for appetizer
all good
the bruschetta would have be good if the bread be not hard
-PRON- prefer -PRON- when -PRON- be a little soft
for dessert -PRON- get the italian coconut layer cake
-PRON- be ok not great
-PRON- guess the place be an after hour spot too but -PRON- do_not stay
all in all -PRON- be a good experience
by_far the good burger place -PRON- have ever be to
the salmon burger mushroom swiss style be amazing
can_not wait to come_back next_year
-PRON- family stop here on a whim to get a snack and order greek fry and bruschetta
both be generous_portion and good value and so delicious -PRON- be look_forward_to visit again before finish -PRON- food
the service be friendly but slow due_to only one server work
-PRON- have be here_twice so_far and both time have be amazing
-PRON- can_not go there without try -PRON- burger
mario kart
that be the name of one of -PRON- burger be -PRON- favourite

-PRON- can_not remember what -PRON- be call
but -PRON- be down right good
-PRON- friend and -PRON- also try the deep_fry oreo and -PRON- be like heaven in -PRON- mouth
the oreo be warm and soft top with a sweet taste of dolce de leche
-PRON- mouth be water just think about -PRON-
-PRON- can_not say anything about the quality of -PRON- food
-PRON- only sit_at the bar long enough to enjoy a couple of beer and watch some march madness
the quick way to turn -PRON- off from return to a restaurant be to let -PRON- whiteness the person_who be serve -PRON- stuff food into -PRON- own face
while -PRON- understand that -PRON- be a slow night hardly want to see -PRON- bar tender stand behind the bar and consume a protein or weight loss shake
next quick way to not have -PRON- return not wash -PRON- hand after touch dirty money and then touch plate with food on -PRON-
the crab_cake benedict be all lump meat and very filling
delicious
-PRON- would definitely check -PRON- out again when -PRON- be in_vegas next week
a very solid lunch meal
sweet_tea be southern accurate
fried_chicken be crispy and juicy very well_season
service be on point attentive drink refill accordingly
fried green tomato blt be the star in -PRON- opinion
only_negative be -PRON- tiny portion of side home fry for the price -PRON- be definitely not enough fry
this bar be actually two bar in one
one be suit for gamble with a dark plusher atmosphere
the other side be an arcade with a non gaming bar
the beer_selection be great and so be the food get the hangover fry
they're delicious
ask for erin
bartender on the gaming side
-PRON- be amazing
fine food for the right price good portion
wait time be a little rough but if -PRON- have the time -PRON- be all good
oreo cheese cake be a plus
thumb_up
-PRON- go for the prime_rib french_dip special
-PRON- would definitely go_back
get there early this_place fill_up fast
try the smoke wing pimento_cheese fry moist brisket rib and burn end
the smoke wing have some amazing flavor and go really well with -PRON- bbq_sauce
no_complaint about the cheese fry
moist brisket be the meat -PRON- like best
ribs and burn end be decent but the brisket be the star of the meal
if -PRON- have ever have moist brisket from rudy 's in texas -PRON- will have no issue devour the brisket at midwood service here be great
-PRON- have be debate with -PRON- self on write about -PRON- experience at alo for more_than four month and now -PRON- be do -PRON-
-PRON- want to go here for over a year since -PRON- hear a lot about -PRON- and the hype be to the roof so -PRON- girlfriend make a booking 2_month a head and there -PRON- go the night finally arrive
-PRON- walk_in and be greet_by the hoste at the elevator and another host at the restaurant who take -PRON- coat and show -PRON- -PRON- table
first thing -PRON- notice be 3 empty table and till end of the night -PRON- be all empty
apparently -PRON- be not that busy anymore so no more 2_month reservation be require
also with dnr app -PRON- can make same night reso
server be very_friendly but -PRON- be not very_knowledgeable and helpful
-PRON- offer -PRON- to get two different set of the tasting_menu to be able_to try everything so -PRON- do so
the menu be 10 course
for drink -PRON- get couple cocktail include one from -PRON- old menu
drink be good but nothing_special
food start come_out and the portion be super tiny 1 to maximum 3 bite which be normal for tasting
unfortunately until end of all the savoury dish both of -PRON- be still hungry
so -PRON- receive three course of dessert which make -PRON- think -PRON- be kind_of full for at_least 15_min because of all the sugar
-PRON- pay_$ 110\/person only for the food before tax tip
the sad part chef\/owner patrick kriss be when -PRON- walk_out -PRON- have to cross the spadina and go to mc donald and get a big mac
as a chef that be so painful for -PRON- that -PRON- guest walk_out hungry and get a big mac
unfortunately because of the hype around alo no one care_about anything_else
-PRON- have eat in many star restaurant around the world and alo be not even close to any of -PRON-
-PRON- definitely will not go_back to alo since there be many good fine din in_toronto
amazing
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend
quick prompt service
-PRON- have an emergency failure of -PRON- a\/c unit this_past_weekend

-PRON- know exactly_what be wrong and change a part out
-PRON- treat -PRON- like -PRON- be -PRON- only customer
answer all of -PRON- question and concern
-PRON- also give -PRON- some great information in regard to preventative maintenance
-PRON- repair be very fair and low than expect
-PRON- look_forward_to do business again
-PRON- be surprised there be not more review on this great company
what can -PRON- say
this be -PRON- third review on one of these studio
lagree fitness\/spx\/pilates
plus whatev -PRON- want to call -PRON- be -PRON- obsession

-PRON- could never ever get enough
every_time -PRON- visit a new city -PRON- always check to see if -PRON- have a new studio
much to -PRON- delight -PRON- find out about studio lagree in forest hill
this be the most beautiful lagree fitness studio -PRON- have ever be to
most of the studio be a little plain but this one be full of beautiful light and these ahhhhmaz new machine
these machine be a little different_than the one in ny and really different_than the one in la but the work out keep get good
which bring -PRON- to the instructor
la use to be in nyc and needless_to_say -PRON- quickly become -PRON- favorite mostly because -PRON- never tolerate those time when -PRON- want to quit and always push -PRON- in a loving
-PRON- want -PRON- to be good_than -PRON- think -PRON- can be in a way that keep -PRON- come_back
-PRON- class be always by_far the hard but simply the good
and then -PRON- disappear
-PRON- nearly fall_off -PRON- chair when -PRON- read the schedule
and -PRON- say la russell
-PRON- be sooooo excited
-PRON- clearly have not lose -PRON- touch
-PRON- class be completely full of newbie but that do_not stop the work out from be amazing
at first -PRON- think
oh no this class will suck because everyone here have no clue what -PRON- be in for
lets just say this girl really have a knack -PRON- wish -PRON- be back in ny
-PRON- encourage each and every one of -PRON- and give -PRON- one of the good workout -PRON- have ever do
nothing compare to the hardcore class -PRON- teach back home
this studio have a unique feature in that there be another instructor someone say -PRON- be -PRON- husband or boyfriend or business partner or all three help everyone with form
this be what really set the class apart from the other -PRON- have take not only be -PRON- comforting but -PRON- keep the class move quickly
as for the other_review "emma
c must have be smoke something
what new business give away free unlimited access to class when -PRON- first open
-PRON- really can_not put a price on this amazing workout
-PRON- actually think that for what -PRON- get two instructor for 11 people -PRON- extremely under price
especially because -PRON- first class be free
parking be a little tricky the village be very busy and although there be a parking_lot close by and a lot_of street parking -PRON- still spend at_least an_extra 10_15_minute look for a place to park every_time -PRON- go
run do_not walk to get the good work out of -PRON- life
-PRON- wife and -PRON- go to rania 's for the first_time tonight and -PRON- both really like -PRON-
-PRON- go at 5_p.m. and be seat_immediately
-PRON- have the cilantro and jalapeño hummus with naan bread for an_appetizer -PRON- have a_little_bit of a twang not too hot and very_tasty
for -PRON- entree -PRON- both order the beef and chicken kabob combo plate with basmati rice
the meat have great seasoning be cook_perfectly and the basmati rice be also very good
-PRON- go to pita jungle often and both agree -PRON- like the hummus and kabob better at rania 's
the portion be large so -PRON- take leftover home and
of_course -PRON- do_not last long when the kid find -PRON- in the fridge
-PRON- have a good size menu and -PRON- be look_forward_to go_back and try_something_different on the menu
-PRON- can_not say enough about emotion of light portraiture
-PRON- picture be more then just a photo -PRON- be piece_of art
-PRON- be professional in -PRON- work and technique
-PRON- get compliment on -PRON- art hang on -PRON- wall all the time
the family photo be unique and -PRON- be happy that -PRON- have memory of -PRON- family capture
in_addition to the quality of work -PRON- be so friendly and -PRON- never feel_like a number as -PRON- do in some studio
trust -PRON-
-PRON- be worth_every dime
no studio could ever accomplish what -PRON- can do
-PRON- highly_recommend this studio to everyone -PRON- know
-PRON- husband and -PRON- have dinner at this restaurant recently
to say -PRON- be disappointing would be an understatement
-PRON- start_off with the california salad -PRON- believe that be the name which have no taste
maybe -PRON- forget the dressing
-PRON- have the petite filet and -PRON- husband have a filet
-PRON- order -PRON- to be do medium
the entire steak be burn on the outside and pretty dry on the inside
for a side -PRON- have a baked yam
that be literally what be serve
a huge plain baked yam on a plate for -PRON- to split -PRON-
there be some item that -PRON- could add to -PRON- on the side of the plate
on a positive note -PRON- do have -PRON- favorite wine and -PRON- husband 's favorite craft_beer
the staff be friendly and polite
with say that -PRON- think -PRON- waitress as fairly new
-PRON- be unfortunate that -PRON- have such a poor experience
if -PRON- be good and if -PRON- feel -PRON- be worth the money -PRON- would have return again this week
pancake scramble_egg and hash_brown be all good
mac_n_cheese bite be pretty_good
the mozzarella stick be okayish
-PRON- husband like the onion_ring and the waffle fry be also okayish
alfredo pasta be like a 3\/5
-PRON- think this_place be good for breakfast and side
the food be fresh both time -PRON- order which be why -PRON- add a fourth star
mike and carl be very courteous and helpful when talk_about set -PRON- up with a security system
-PRON- have talk with carl a couple of week_ago but forget to peruse -PRON- any further
-PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- be pushy at all either of the time
-PRON- feel_comfortable know -PRON- be a local company who -PRON- could contact at any time if -PRON- have a concern
-PRON- will be get -PRON- system instal tomorrow and will do an updated review after that
have live in the middle east for 10_year have set the bar pretty high for shawarma
however -PRON- do_not knock -PRON- until -PRON- try -PRON-
so base_on a recommendation -PRON- try the shawarma from mr. zagros
disclaimer
-PRON- be starve prior to eat the shawarma so -PRON- could have be make with dirt and car part
and -PRON- would have still think -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- ask what the difference be between the wrap and pita and employee tell -PRON- -PRON- the same_thing with the difference only be in size
-PRON- opt_for 2 small shawarma one for -PRON- brother and one for -PRON-
-PRON- like that -PRON- mix all the veggie sauce and chicken in a bowl prior to put -PRON- in the bread because -PRON- evenly distribute all the ingredient
the bread however the bread
when -PRON- take a bite of the shawarma -PRON- be blind by hunger so do_not notice -PRON- at first but the bread be so thick and dry
-PRON- could hardly taste the copious amount_of fill because the bread be overwhelmingly dry and thick
after a long day at the beach -PRON- just want something yummy
but -PRON- could_not finish the shawarma after the first few_bite
-PRON- think -PRON- would have be slightly good if -PRON- grill the shawarma-
-PRON- be cold and dry
base_on the other_review -PRON- see that -PRON- have a homemade bread which -PRON- be guess be much good_than the pita
-PRON- wish the employee have tell -PRON- before so -PRON- could have go for that instead
brunch at mingo today be simply outstanding
dining on the patio in this incredible weather could_not have be more perfect
the taco with chorizo be to die for
the cuban sandwich be perfect and the burger top with bacon and an egg serve with a side of rosemary fry
yum_yum yum
hurry up sunday and come_back around so -PRON- can do -PRON- again
preface
-PRON- puppy go to puppy play at_this_location and -PRON- be a perfectly clean facility and the staff be nice enough
fast_forward 8 month
-PRON- work out an afternoon to come down and have -PRON- evaluate for day care
multiple reschedule -PRON- fault not theirs
-PRON- show_up get to the second question
and -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have growl at the water bowl 3 or 4 time with other dog
-PRON- say sorry try a small day care
-PRON- can_not watch -PRON- dog all day
-PRON- have 40 dog here
wait be not that the point of daycare to watch -PRON- dog
this could have be handle over the phone
leave two_star for business process of qualify dog
-PRON- be sure -PRON- do a great_job with the 40 dog
tldr upset by qualification process waste -PRON- entire afternoon and break -PRON- pup heart that -PRON- be in the threshold of -PRON- childhood playground and turn away
this_place be awesome
so_many thing to look_at see make -PRON- laugh
ton_of great gifts\/idea
-PRON- spend a long_time peruse through the store many item
-PRON- especially like the book and magnet
-PRON- want to buy everything
-PRON- do_not however because the price be a_bit much
happy to learn -PRON- have an online store and ship anywhere
-PRON- can_not stand cleveland
-PRON- be one of the bleak most depressing place -PRON- have ever be to
but this_place be probably -PRON- favorite bar ever
-PRON- be bring here by friend that -PRON- be visit during a road trip and -PRON- be supris on how good -PRON- be
very unhappy no star for uhaul
but give just a star for cleanliness
wait too_long even_though there be not a line
the bad part be that -PRON- specifically say to put in the same amount_of gas when return the truck -PRON- do that but the guy_who help -PRON- check_out be very rude and tell -PRON- that the gas be not enough and have to put in $_17 more
so -PRON- have to drive back out add mile and that $_17 make -PRON- truck a full tanked gas which be more_than -PRON- be when -PRON- get -PRON-
such a rip_off
-PRON- be now call bj buffet and -PRON- be under new new ownership
the advertised price be now $ 6.99 all day every_day
this_place have really go downhill fast
the food quality be lack and the food have get cheap
there use to be thing like teriyaki chicken on a stick orange chicken shrimp and other staple
but now those item be go and there be actually slice tomato and hard boil egg available
the service have go down also
-PRON- have to ask for thing like refill now
-PRON- be give -PRON- two_star because the food be edible
-PRON- still have mongolian bbq but even there be only few vegetable available now
-PRON- be with a large party if people and none_of -PRON- expect to be back
-PRON- start go here because of the great price of the oil_change
however -PRON- go_back because -PRON- break have be squeak
-PRON- have fine customer_service but soon after -PRON- break be squeak again
-PRON- take -PRON- back and -PRON- replace the pad
a few_week later squeak again -PRON- take -PRON- back and -PRON- replace the pad
this be become very inconvenient as -PRON- husband and -PRON- both work full time and -PRON- have 3 small child -PRON- can_not be come to sit for hour every few_week month to get something look_at that be supposedly fix already
the last_time -PRON- go there -PRON- say -PRON- be go to put in the good break pad so -PRON- wait a_few day for -PRON- to order -PRON- and -PRON- to come in
-PRON- break be squeak just a short time later -PRON- have another mechanic look_at -PRON- and -PRON- say that first of all -PRON- only change 2 of -PRON- not 4 like -PRON- have say
-PRON- also say -PRON- definitely do_not put the good -PRON- be just the regular one and that be probably why -PRON- keep squeak as -PRON- have a large suv
for charge 600 + -PRON- would have assume that this_establishment would have take_care_of -PRON- the first_time if not the 2nd or 3rd time when realize what -PRON- be put in be not stand up
-PRON- obviously do_not have a high_standard of ethic here
wow this_place be really good
-PRON- do_not understand some of the bad review unless -PRON- be early on when -PRON- open
the staff\/gauchos be super_friendly
want more or look for certain meat just ask
-PRON- sister love the grill pineapple
-PRON- highly_recommend
better and cheap_than texas de brazil
this have to be one of -PRON- new_favorite place
with outdoor_seating -PRON- make for a great hangout after work
-PRON- plan to be a regular
the flatbread be great and the wind and beer_on_tap be delightful
-PRON- highly_recommend

ahh best donut ever
bosa be amazing and anything -PRON- get there be fabulous
-PRON- have a drive_through too
-PRON- be awesome
nothing bad to say about -PRON-
environment
king edward 's arms be a uk style pub locate_in a rather asian neighbourhood
locate around the hwy7\/warden -PRON- be kinda hard to locate this_place if -PRON- do_not check gps beforehand
there be plenty_of free_parking at the plaza especially directly in front of the pub
the pub in -PRON- be rather small but -PRON- have a lot_of character that resemble british pub
there be lot_of tv on the wall which be great for people want to grab a drink while watch the game
but since the space be limit -PRON- be ideal to go in a small group_of 4 of less though -PRON- do see family come_here for dinner as_well
food
-PRON- order a king size wing with honey_garlic sauce and fry on the side and -PRON- be good_than many place -PRON- have try
first of all the portion be huge which -PRON- have to pack some home
the flavour be pretty_good as_well
usually -PRON- do_not like too_much sauce because -PRON- become too overpower and this_place have the right_amount_of sauce drizzle on the wing
there be a lot_of sauce at the bottom of the basket if -PRON- like a full flavour
the wing be fry to perfect crispiness
be careful when -PRON- take a bite as -PRON- make -PRON- fresh and -PRON- be still very hot when -PRON- serve -PRON- to -PRON-
service
service be meh and food be kind_of slow
from what -PRON- see there be only one waitress serve all the table and the bar
do_not expect the waitress to come check up on how -PRON- be do as -PRON- be already difficult to track -PRON- down because -PRON- have to serve everyone there
there be probably only one chef at the back as_well consider -PRON- take around 20min for -PRON- wing to come
outstanding thin_crust pizza and great variety on the topping wonderful salad ton_of tv for keep up on the sporting event of the day a really nice bar great service ton_of game skee ball air hockey crane game mini bowling etc lot_of quality pool_table and an incredibly nice staff

have $_100 dollar on standby to access at will what be already include in -PRON- rent -PRON- garage
-PRON- can_not imagine maintenance be pay_$ 50\/hr
in_addition -PRON- should take no long than 15_minute to reprogram a gate\/garage remote control
-PRON- do_not see the logic in the price but_hey -PRON- be in the lease agreement
in the image -PRON- can see -PRON- new use remote
-PRON- just pay_$ 100 for and a screenshot of the actual cost of the hardware remote -PRON-
just to add if -PRON- buy -PRON- in bulk -PRON- can get 3 for $_16
-PRON- do like this_place and have have -PRON- share of experience but this one really throw -PRON- for a loop
-PRON- have eat dinner here a couple time
for the most_part the food be good and -PRON- have be consistent
one item -PRON- like about -PRON- menu be the indo chinese section
-PRON- think this be something unique that reflect the regional difference that often get gloss over in indian cuisine
the food be flavorful and service be fast
-PRON- two complaint 1 something always seem to get miscommunicat to the kitchen regard the spiciness of the dish
not too hot--_too mild
this have be verify when -PRON- look_at -PRON- cheque -PRON- list the spiciness request next to the dish
2
while quick to refill water if -PRON- order any_other beverage -PRON- get forget
-PRON- soda\/tea glass be empty and -PRON- eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill
in_term_of service this be a big issue for -PRON- personally
bottom_line good food pretty_good service
-PRON- hope to one day be in_charlotte to try the lunch buffet other_reviewer have rave_about
one last item this_place be in a tiny shopping area with a tiny parking_lot so be forewarn
this be the good mattress -PRON- have ever own no pun intend
the people in the store really know -PRON- stuff -PRON- be deliver the same_day and the price be what -PRON- expect to pay
the only problem -PRON- have with this mattress be that -PRON- do_not want to get out of -PRON-
and in the afternoon when -PRON- get home from work -PRON- say to -PRON- that -PRON- must be 11 o'clock at night somewhere
-PRON- know people_who want to drink will say that -PRON- be 5 o'clock somewhere in the world and -PRON- say the same_thing about want to get into -PRON- bed because -PRON- be so comfortable
-PRON- have use best mattress for 15_year and -PRON- would never go_anywhere_else

-PRON- both declare that -PRON- be overdue for a pedicure
good thing nails spa on selwyn be just a short jaunt from yoforia
mom and -PRON- roll in there on a saturday_afternoon without an_appointment and go with the deluxe pedicure
for $_30 this sweet pedi include with paraffin treatment an exfoliator masque hot towel treatment and of_course the polish of -PRON- choosing
btw
the difference_between the basic pedi and the upgraded deluxe be only $_4 per_person
totally_worth -PRON-
the staff there be friendly but quiet which -PRON- do_not really mind as -PRON- be there chat with -PRON- mama
-PRON- also state on -PRON- website and in the shop that -PRON- offer complimentary refreshment with every service
-PRON- be not offer a refreshment which be not a huge deal
but -PRON- probably would have enjoy a bottle_of water if available
-PRON- choose -PRON- polish -PRON- have a large variety_of opi essie and be direct to the massage chair seat above the pedicure basin
before the nail_tech even start -PRON- be supremely enjoy the massage chair
who do_not love a massage chair
the deluxe pedicure -PRON- be very_nice
the tech be very_thorough and -PRON- love the extra goody that come with the deluxe package
the paraffin treatment be probably -PRON- favorite
as for the finished product -PRON- foot and toe feel super soft and look perfectly polished
-PRON- take a brief view at -PRON- spa menu and -PRON- look_like -PRON- offer other service like wax and facial too
as an fyi -PRON- only accept cash or check here and -PRON- do have an atm inside the nail_salon
-PRON- have a prominent sign on the door advise of this to all of -PRON- who never carry cash
that would be -PRON-

der club bietet viele
altenativen da er drei floor anbietet
einen black floor einen house floor und einen chill out floor
meine erafhrung ist aber dass es empfehlenswert ist mit vielen frauen anzutanzen weil das den
einlass erheblich vereinfacht

the carpet be that really thin berber the paint be uneven in spot
one of the bathtub have a weird bump in the middle
there be no refrigerator no microwave no coffee maker and apparently only two iron in the whole hotel
the fact_that -PRON- have to use out hotel room key in order to work the elevator be slightly annoying
-PRON- get stick downstairs one drunken night and have to have the front_desk call -PRON- room for -PRON- ok ok ok
but -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- be hecka cheap and the people that work there be super_nice include the valet man in the front
the bed be comfy and -PRON- do have the good showerhead -PRON- have ever see
-PRON- be square and big i want one to bring home
the pool_table be a little marked up
but oh_well
the food be actually good_than decent and when -PRON- have two connect room -PRON- be a crazy amount_of room with a looooooong hallway
overall good experience
-PRON- have a lot_of people stay in the hotel in different room on different floor
-PRON- get a_few visit from security which be again slightly annoying but -PRON- be loud drunk and in_vegas so understandable
if -PRON- be on a budget then -PRON- would_recommend -PRON-
-PRON- prefer to stay on the strip but if -PRON- take a spontaneous trip to vegas with very little money -PRON- would probably end_up here
this be -PRON- second_time here
the first_time be over 2 yrs ago
friendly_staff good price for -PRON- breakfast special
-PRON- have scramble_egg with 3)bacon and potato and toast which be price under_$ 7
strange that coffee refill be 81 cent as i recall -PRON- give this breakfast experience 2.5 star because i suggest have breakfast here to -PRON- sister whom be visit from ottawa
everything be good up to pay for the food -PRON- cash_only
so i have to borrow $_$ from -PRON- sister
then when -PRON- sit_down there be 6 of -PRON- -PRON- wait and wait and wait
-PRON- know that restaurant like to bring the table all the meal at once but -PRON- do_not order anything out of the ordinary
-PRON- order the french_toast special and the eggs\/bacon special
-PRON- believe -PRON- take over 25 min
and -PRON- sister point out that people that come after -PRON- be get -PRON- food first
bacon be salty and -PRON- can see the grease on -PRON-
everything_else be fine
table be a_bit sticky
-PRON- think the wait time kill this experience
go as a couple
let -PRON- see what_happen next_time
this be a completely standard double tree hotel
bed be clean comfortable and -PRON- can expect a standardized guest experience
-PRON- would book again
the reason this review be a 4-star rather_than a 3-star be that the staff be friendly and accommodate
-PRON- walk back to the hotel on the second night of -PRON- trip and get catch in a snow storm
when -PRON- arrive in the lobby the staff laugh and welcome -PRON- back by offer warm cookie for free
these be the third and fourth cookie of -PRON- visit and the host attitude be a nice way to be greet in a new city
thank
this be a new wine beer and spirit store in the valley though -PRON- have over fifty store throughout the nation

whenever -PRON- be back in_town
-PRON- always find time for a meal here the handcut fry coleslaw chicken everything here be to die for
-PRON- have be on a falafel kick and on the quest to find the tasty one around_town
this be a serious contender
-PRON- love that -PRON- be a stuff pocket and not just fold up like a taco and the bread be fresh make
this be how shawarma place -PRON- frequent as a kid do -PRON-
-PRON- be also awesome how -PRON- can pick -PRON- topping
-PRON- like that -PRON- give -PRON- a bottle_of tahini for the table since -PRON- loveeee tahini and pepper paste
the falafel -PRON- be crispy but still fluffy inside and have good flavor
-PRON- be come_back for this for sure
-PRON- also try a shawarma and this be good but -PRON- be not quite the shawarma -PRON- be look for
good spice but the meat do_not come from a spit but pan
-PRON- also grab some pastry
two baklava a flowery macaroon of sort a date cookie
the baklava be money
-PRON- be syrupy in a good way
when -PRON- bite in -PRON- be moist with syrup but -PRON- be not_overly sweet
definitely will be get
the other two be just okay
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- would get again
price be reasonable
two sandwich -PRON- think -PRON- be $ 6.50 each two drink
4 pastry be $ 26
conclusion- falaf'n tasty
bak lovin
though there be a_few okay item -PRON- order those two item be some good eat
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- wish -PRON- understand_why this store be not live_up to -PRON- potential
all the ingredient be there but the employee just can_not or will not execute
-PRON- go for supper tonight and get the pull_pork_sandwich with fry
-PRON- take considerably long than normal to get the food especially consider there be only a couple other customer
when the young_lady deliver the food -PRON- should have tell -PRON- to take -PRON- back because the fry be so overcook see pic
after about_10_minute -PRON- just decide to call -PRON- over and -PRON- kind_of nod like -PRON- know and be agree with -PRON-
well what bug -PRON- be the cook think -PRON- be ok to send -PRON- out that way as do -PRON- when -PRON- deliver -PRON-
so anyway -PRON- take -PRON- back and replace -PRON- and -PRON- be only marginally good see pic
a gentleman bring -PRON- a coupon for a free side but by then the damage be do
-PRON- have no desire to return until -PRON- be calabash seafood time
-PRON- can_not speak highly_enough about high park cat sit
on the initial visit both the owner brenda and the sitter lauren come to meet -PRON- little bowie
-PRON- will_admit -PRON- be feel a_bit uneasy have to leave a young cat with a relative stranger for a week
-PRON- be very_professional and thorough when learn about bowie 's routine
-PRON- go on_vacation for one week and about midweek
-PRON- receive an email from lauren let -PRON- know_how -PRON- cat be do
and -PRON- also send update photo
correspondence be quick payment be easy
everything go smoothly
bowie be in great hand
-PRON- mind be at_ease know that bowie be be care for by someone that genuinely love animal
-PRON- can definitely trust -PRON- to care for -PRON- fur baby
go at open and smell like food be be prepp
order peanut_butter pancake and -PRON- be gluten_free also
-PRON- 2 pancake like a big plate size could only finish 1 and half
bud get pot pie the hash_brown be moist and creamy
stay_here one night extend -PRON- trip
the check in be a joke look more like a disneyland attraction line zig zagg back and forth
-PRON- take over 30_minute to check in on a monday afternoon
the room floor 31 of 32 be so so and at $ 66 on_monday + the hidden $_20 resort_fee and tax put the room at almost $_100
do -PRON- mention -PRON- be on_monday
-PRON- go to the pub keg room and wait for a_few to be seat at about 9_p.m. monday_night
after sit_at a table for 20_minute with no waiter or waitress even give -PRON- water -PRON- walk_out
as -PRON- leave -PRON- hand the matradee -PRON- menu and tell -PRON- no thank
-PRON- do_not even bat an eye or offer any attempt to retain -PRON- business- sad
for -PRON- money -PRON- would_rather go_back to the golden nuggett rush tower downtown
if -PRON- have not check that out do -PRON- a favor and take a look
-PRON- have eat at culinary dropout enough time that -PRON- have probably try half the item on the menu
-PRON- be a great place to enjoy a hip evening on the town
the outdoor_seating be especially nice and -PRON- have heat lamp for when -PRON- get a little cold out
the pretzel fondue appetizer be a crowd pleaser
the meatloaf butternut squash cannelloni and chicken curry be standout on the entree menu
the good aspect of this_place though be the amazing service
the staff be incredibly friendly and attentive
hidden_gem in mesa
-PRON- find out about this_place from -PRON- classmate
what catch -PRON- off guard be that this be the first_time -PRON- have to pay for parking for any hike in az
1 car be about $_6
although when -PRON- do think about -PRON- -PRON- be save money on gas since this hike be local and -PRON- do_not have to drive an_hour for a hike
the informational desk will give -PRON- a map and description of all the hike
-PRON- close and convenient
great area to hike cap ride bike horse or camp in mesa az
this be a pretty average stadium and actually rather small compare to all the stadium in the us
food option be as varied as -PRON- be in chicago but without the culinary big player
-PRON- seem small than the staple center and with less promotional stall before the game
overall -PRON- serve -PRON- purpose with nothing to really take home
-PRON- first_visit to see -PRON- and -PRON- be pleasantly_surprised
-PRON- be young energetic and show a real concern for -PRON- overall health
-PRON- have all the new knowledge about procedure and test and do_not_waste -PRON- time by try to have -PRON- go_through a bunch_of unnecessary item
have a really good personality and a sense of humor
if -PRON- be look for marcus welby then -PRON- be not -PRON- physician
love -PRON-
-PRON- have see -PRON- for year on yonge street head downtown and always wonder about -PRON-
but because -PRON- in the middle_of eglinton and davisville on yonge -PRON- not exactly somewhere -PRON- would find -PRON- go out to dinner
however when -PRON- be plan a summerlicious dinner out with friend_who only eat halal meat
-PRON- think this would be the perfect time to try this middle_eastern restaurant
the pluses 1
food
great big portion even for the summerlicious menu for summerlicious specifically a great selection on the menu excellent meal from appetizer entree to dessert 2
entertainment value the water pour performance
-PRON- be a show
-PRON- find -PRON- stop -PRON- conversation watch the water be pour and just because of that if nothing else one can be assure that -PRON- will walk_out of there hydrate
there be a belly dancer but -PRON- do_not see -PRON- when -PRON- be there 3
patio
great patio -PRON- not on the most crowded part of yonge street
and -PRON- have a good amount_of space 4
service
-PRON- be not exceptional by any mean but the staff be friendly
-PRON- do have to wait to be serve -PRON- do forget about -PRON- initially when -PRON- be seat on the patio and there be a confusion of who -PRON- server be there be the greeter at the front_door
the hostess who walk -PRON- to -PRON- seat the water performer be all warm up act lead to the server who be around 20_minute late 5
halal
-PRON- be so great to find a nice look place at a great location that serve halal food
but be aware that only -PRON- meat be halal and not the chicken
-PRON- do_not make_sense to -PRON-
but that be what -PRON- say
appetizer
-PRON- have the grill eggplant which be toss in lemon delic
and the rest_of table have the sampler plate with a great tabule not over do with parsley mini falafel and baba ganoush or hummus -PRON- can_not remember
the platter be great as_well
entree
-PRON- order the lamb dish which be phenomenal
-PRON- be not a red meat eater but have be tell -PRON- need to add -PRON- to -PRON- diet
so -PRON- decide to make this meal -PRON- first go at lamb and -PRON- think may just be a convert now
the aroma in the dish and the flavour in the gravy be divine
each entrée come with rice and grill vegetable which be really great as_well
dessert the orange\/ raspberry sherbet ice_cream be the good -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- be incredible so_glad -PRON- pick this over the baklava plate
-PRON- have never taste anything like -PRON-
have be there once_again since summerlicious and would love to back
holy_crap this_place be great
amazing deal
-PRON- find this a great place to pass time in_vegas so that -PRON- do_not spend all of -PRON- money
$_3 1\/4 lb all beef hot_dog with a bottle_of beer
nice
quarter video poker at the bar
nice
-PRON- be a fan_of quarter game in_vegas
$_4 shot of patron hell
yeah
only_reason -PRON- do_not give this_place 5_star be because -PRON- be not what -PRON- come to vegas for
but -PRON- sure do supplement the experience
the best cold noodle -PRON- have have so_far
seriously
favorite orders
1
the slushy broth cold noodles with fried dumplings
-PRON- will fall -PRON- love
2 steamed kimchi pork something
-PRON- always order every_time -PRON- be there
tips =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =_=
for first_timer you need to get a number at the cashier desk
-PRON- all the way at the back and usually the boss be stand at the cash register
once -PRON- get the number listen for -PRON- as -PRON- will call -PRON- out
in the summer when there be huge line up outside the staff usually call the number inside and then if no one answer -PRON- usually come outside to check as_well
but if -PRON- want to be on the safe side have someone stand inside to listen for -PRON- table number
take out =_=_=_= =_=_=_= =_=
the take out menu be limit and different from the main menu just an fyi
dr grossman be wonderful
-PRON- do -PRON- all include -PRON- own blood draw
-PRON- be the one who -PRON- deal with when -PRON- be there
and -PRON- be very_personable
-PRON- be happy thai food be available in this area of ohio
the green_curry sauce be delicious and the staff be friendly
the green_bean carrot and pea in the curry dish look_like -PRON- be just thaw and heat from a bag of frozen veggie
-PRON- prefer fresh vegetable in -PRON- curry dish
the tofu be delicious
chili oil can be request on the side
chopstick do_not appear to be an option here
-PRON- hope -PRON- fix -PRON- wing since the last_time -PRON- be there -PRON- be unseason un sauced small piece_of un bread fry_chicken
as for the club sandwich -PRON- be basic ham turkey with undercooked bacon on un toast bread serve with american cheese which do_not even get -PRON- start on american cheese
notice how everything be under done"
that be why -PRON- get a bad review because -PRON- be lazy about preparation
try toast the bread sauce the wing have variety_of sauce create -PRON- own sauce pepper the bacon etc
-PRON- a tough business if -PRON- cut corner -PRON- food will suck and -PRON- will get call out
have a bar be not just about have good beer
edit
okay
okay
-PRON- bump -PRON- review up to 2_star because yes the beer be tasty and cold and service be pretty_good
maybe -PRON- may try -PRON- again but the scrutiny that -PRON- have get from management regard this review have be unreal so probably not
yume sushi grill be a great spot
all of the sushi be very fresh and -PRON- pride -PRON- in have great quality

-PRON- recommend the bulgogi bi bim bab and spicy pork for meal

the one complaint that -PRON- have be that -PRON- do_not stock a_few of -PRON- favorite kind_of sushi although -PRON- know -PRON- be not the most popular mackerel quail egg and surf clam will not be find on the menu
the grumpy old guy that own this_place will cut any key -PRON- bring -PRON-

-PRON- do_not get the bad review
-PRON- guess -PRON- can all go_back to denny_'s or ihop
the art on the wall be sort_of creepy though
one thing -PRON- can say about this_place be -PRON- will always get good service and very good food
no_matter_what -PRON- order all of -PRON- be good

-PRON- think this have now become a place for -PRON- so
and -PRON- to snag breakfast in_vegas
-PRON- initially find -PRON- because -PRON- walk over when stay_at the palms and -PRON- be not a far drive from the strip

of_course this be a car show and -PRON- all about car
but there_s no tour from anyone no one explain anything to -PRON-
-PRON- walk_in look_at the car and walk_out
boring to -PRON-
cars in front gift_shop to the right exit to the left
thank for come

not ask to go into the shop and smell the paint or play with the tool
just wanna know about the car on display
that_s all
-PRON- be -PRON- second_time to dine_in here
-PRON- come as a big group_of 9
-PRON- server work hard on -PRON- but -PRON- be still nice and polite
back to -PRON- food -PRON- be quite impressed_by thi wing
many of -PRON- like 3-alarm chicken_wing
personally -PRON- think wing here be much good_than the another popular brand of wing in_term_of size and flavorful
too_bad this_location be far_from downtown
otherwise -PRON- would visit more_often
-PRON- have 3 pan of pizza hawaiian chicago and double deckeroni
the last one be recommend by -PRON- server
-PRON- do a great_job
-PRON- all love -PRON- the most
-PRON- be much good when u order -PRON- in thin style
-PRON- would say hawaiian here be the bad -PRON- have have so_far
-PRON- be a fan_of hawaiian but definitely not from this_place
the flavor be mediocre
mehh
in short -PRON- definitely_come_back for wing for sure
-PRON- visit this_location with friend family for a birthday_celebration
the experience be less_than what -PRON- expect
-PRON- be a party of 10 do_not receive what -PRON- come for
no sake small serving and miss item
would not recommend_this_place for dinner or anything
-PRON- order from here last_night and -PRON- be excellent
-PRON- be so impressed_with -PRON- flavourful and tasty dish
-PRON- order shanghai noodle ton_of flavour and general tao chicken win ton soup
the general tao chicken be crispy and not soak in wet sauce that would make -PRON- soggy
-PRON- be amazing
the deliver be very quick prob 25 min max when -PRON- be tell 45_min
that be always a bonus
-PRON- will be go_back for sure
5\/5 star
great entertainment although not as grand as mystere
a great time and family friendly
well_worth the time and money spend
good repair place in_town
brendan and everyone be extremely helpful
-PRON- fix -PRON- fracked phone for a great price and in a short amount_of time
-PRON- definitely_recommend here
what a horrible customer_service
the waiter do_not_know anything about the menu
-PRON- ask the waiter if a dish be spicy or not
-PRON- say -PRON- do_not_know and walk_away
have to ask 2 different people to get chili sauce
the food be not bad but not worth -PRON- for the price
if -PRON- be like -PRON- brazilian wax be something -PRON- dread
but this_place
amazing
lest painful wax -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- seriously have -PRON- bare in like 5_minute and -PRON- be hardly flinch
-PRON- only_complaint be -PRON- have some random hair and normally technician tend_to pluck -PRON-
oh_well
get -PRON- -PRON-
also -PRON- be really cheap to get wax here
go
now
explain to -PRON- why -PRON- need to pay for parking when -PRON- do_not have enough spot -PRON- do_not enforce parking and -PRON- have a handicap guest with -PRON- and no handicap spot be available because non handicap vehicle be park in handicap spot
mangement basically laugh in -PRON- face and do_not seem to care
so not worth -PRON-
nothing bad then rude staff
come in around 6:20 maybe darn just miss happy_hour and ask the hostess for -PRON- opinion -PRON- have a show to catch at 7:30 would -PRON- have enough time to eat_here or should -PRON- go_somewhere_else
-PRON- say -PRON- would be fine and that -PRON- usually take 45_minute so -PRON- get seat
-PRON- ask -PRON- waitress about the yelp_deal that give -PRON- a free appetizer with order of an entree
and -PRON- say -PRON- would have to check with -PRON- manager first because -PRON- may only accept print coupon
c'mon hon -PRON- be a deal that -PRON- get from check in on_yelp with -PRON- mobile phone if -PRON- expect people to print this out then -PRON- be go to yell_at -PRON-
so when -PRON- come_back -PRON- end_up say that -PRON- think -PRON- be okay but another waiter be take over -PRON- table so when -PRON- pay -PRON- can just bring up the deal to -PRON-
-PRON- order the chicken quesadilla appetizer and bf get one of the sandwich -PRON- think chicken with sweet_potato_fry upgrade
then -PRON- wait and wait and wait
-PRON- waiter have already refill -PRON- water_glass twice and then as -PRON- continue to wait -PRON- think -PRON- just start to avoid -PRON- table altogether
at maybe 7:10 -PRON- finally just stop -PRON- and ask how_much long -PRON- food would be
and -PRON- say -PRON- would check
-PRON- come_back with -PRON- food and -PRON- ask for the check and have to ask about the yelp_deal all over again
bf 's order do_not have sweet_potato_fry no way do -PRON- have time to exchange -PRON- though
as irritated as -PRON- be when -PRON- begin to eat -PRON- be kind_of like
okay well this be pretty yummy
that be pretty_much the only_thing save -PRON- in this review because -PRON- be still so irritated by the communication between worker and the service overall
yes -PRON- be friendly but geez
the hostess know -PRON- be in a rush but never bother to let -PRON- server know
and when -PRON- switch out server -PRON- should be update the server replace -PRON- about anything regard the table do_not tell the customer to re explain something to the new server
-PRON- understand -PRON- situation be a little different because -PRON- be in a rush to begin with but if -PRON- be go to wait that long just to receive the food -PRON- would have appreciate be tell at the door that -PRON- should consider eat somewhere faster
most dish be overprice but the yelp_deal do make -PRON- worth eat there so thanks yelp
rather unpleasant experience but the food be not to blame
-PRON- love_this_place -PRON- have the good patio and -PRON- staff be almost always super_friendly
some of -PRON- staff be not always the most pleasant but -PRON- get the drink out quick and that be what count for -PRON- here
-PRON- patio be dog friendly before five
and -PRON- think -PRON- be cool with dog stay there as_well if -PRON- end_up hang_out after five
price be affordable but the atmosphere and the patio be the real reason to go here
in other news -PRON- have get out of bed at like 11 pm to go get cheese stick to go from here because -PRON- just crave -PRON- sometimes
opening night at big earl_'s
-PRON- be busy right at opening look_like old_town need a bbq joint
-PRON- know there be much debate about what constitute real bbq imho
there be many real bbq
a wide range of cooking style rub sauce texture flavor etc
the point be no one bbq can hope to please everybody
with that in mind big earl_'s have a definite style
1 all the sauce be slightly spicy
there be no sweet or tangy sauce here
indeed the ghost chile sauce be awesome hot
2 all the sauce be smoky
if -PRON- do_not like -PRON- bbq to be slightly metallic i.e. like an iron skillet this will not work for -PRON-
that say -PRON- encourage -PRON- to give big earl_'s a try and decide for -PRON-
the staff be friendly and knowledgeable good_than -PRON- expect for an opening night
prompt drink refill in a nice canning jar glass
-PRON- be a little annoyed with the guy_who keep steal -PRON- dirty napkin
-PRON- could have absorb a little more sauce
app just -PRON-
tonight
so -PRON- only sample two the fry_pickle and the big earl_'s challenge wing
the pickle be indescribably awesome -PRON- could_not stop eat -PRON-
seem to taste both dill and slightly sweet like a cinnamon sugar and wonderfully crunchy in -PRON- light breading\/batter
the wing be cover in the big earl_'s ghost chile sauce good hot
the heat do_not grab -PRON- right up front but build to a nice burn after a_few wing
oddly the sauce seem to make the skin on the wing slippery so watch out for fly wing
the brisket be awesome
sure to be a tough competitor in this year 's brisket throw down
the pull_pork be tender and juicy can_not wait to try -PRON- in a sandwich
the pork rib be a little dry for -PRON- but nothing a little extra sauce do_not cure
-PRON- have side of mac_n_cheese and homemade fry
both worth have again
although -PRON- need to eat the mac_n_cheese first because -PRON- cool quickly and lose some of -PRON- creamy goodness
-PRON- order a banana pudding for desert which -PRON- take home to share with -PRON- wife
-PRON- have_no_idea how -PRON- taste because -PRON- do_not share
-PRON- call to schedule a move on saturday morning with the corporate office
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- only have a limited time period to move either that saturday or the following saturday
-PRON- say that -PRON- could fit -PRON- in the follow saturday and that there be a possibility -PRON- could get -PRON- in later that day
-PRON- say that -PRON- would have the local office call -PRON- later that day if -PRON- could fit -PRON- in that day or bad case on_monday to finalize the quote but assure -PRON- the move could take place the following saturday
on_monday -PRON- call headquarter back because -PRON- do_not hear from anyone and the guy_who -PRON- be on the phone with be rude and tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not schedule for saturday and that -PRON- would need to wait for the local franchise to call -PRON- to see if -PRON- could fit -PRON- in which be completely different_than the lady tell -PRON- 2 day prior
-PRON- ask the guy if -PRON- could put -PRON- on hold and call the local franchise or give -PRON- the phone_number for to local franchise as -PRON- be 5 day away_from when the move be suppose to be schedule
and -PRON- still have not hear from anyone
-PRON- tell -PRON- that the local franchise do_not have phone_number and -PRON- would just have to wait
-PRON- follow_up by let -PRON- know -PRON- could take the risk of not have the company be able_to fit -PRON- in and ask what -PRON- should do and -PRON- say all -PRON- can do be wait and if the local franchise do_not call -PRON- call -PRON- and let -PRON- know -PRON- be not do -PRON- job
-PRON- tell -PRON- this be not satisfactory and -PRON- be not -PRON- responsibility as the customer to tell the headquarters that -PRON- franchise be not do -PRON- job and -PRON- response be
-PRON- do_not have an answer for -PRON- and then -PRON- hang_up_on -PRON-
would never do business with this_company again
jamelle be amazing
-PRON- be able_to_help -PRON- last_minute with -PRON- wedding 4\/03\/15
when -PRON- speak -PRON- even give idea that -PRON- do_not think about for -PRON- ceremony
-PRON- think -PRON- be just as excited as -PRON-
maybe even more
-PRON- ask question about how -PRON- want the ceremony to be
which be really nice because -PRON- do_not_know much about wedding
and with that thing really fall_into place with -PRON- help
-PRON- have a sweet little wedding and -PRON- be very happy -PRON- be apart of -PRON-
defiantly someone -PRON- would_recommend in a heartbeat
molly 's be one of -PRON- staple

but -PRON- be nice
-PRON- have nice shop and place to eat
be center of the strip be amazing
close to everything
-PRON- really feel as if -PRON- should have pack some knee pad for this trip to vegas
-PRON- think this buffet sound_like a bargain compare to the bacchanal buffet at caesar 's
-PRON- be tell -PRON- be only $_35 each for dinner
caesar 's be almost $_60 a head
-PRON- recollection of the bellagio_buffet be that -PRON- have pretty amazing food
the beef wellington and chilean sea_bass be particularly memorable last_time
-PRON- seem_like -PRON- would be a bargain at this price
what -PRON- do_not count on be that -PRON- would charge -PRON- four year_old a full adult admission
oh and since -PRON- be friday -PRON- would be $_40 each
well the food be not nearly as good this time around
dish for dish the caesars buffet be far good
the only_thing be that the bellagio have king_crab leg though -PRON- do_not seem properly defrost and be quite waterlogged
and -PRON- can_imagine how pleased -PRON- be at pay_$ 40 for -PRON- daughter 's roll and spoonful of macaroni and cheese
what the hell be -PRON- think charge a little kid that much
what a bunch_of crook -PRON- be definitely not the same now that -PRON- be own by mgm
great place for breakfast and coffee
breakfast be a amazing with great spice to the dish
pretty average sub
-PRON- be more expensive than subway and do_not taste much good in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- do notice -PRON- slice -PRON- own meat and cheese so -PRON- do think the ingredient be a_bit fresh
however -PRON- do_not really taste the difference
pft
eh
-PRON- love virgin cheese
try -PRON- first on a tasting platter at vegenation and have to buy a block for -PRON- from the market
the sriracha be -PRON- fave and shallot truffle also a+
if -PRON- look for the good insurance agent in_las_vegas call jeremy shugarman
-PRON- be look for a liability policy for -PRON- business and jeremy be by_far the most informative and concerned about -PRON- good interest
-PRON- go_above and beyond what -PRON- ask for and be very informative in every aspect of insurance
do -PRON- want the good insurance advise
do -PRON- want the good value
call jeremy
huey always know_how to make a girl happy
-PRON- have be go to -PRON- for year

-PRON- be honestly the good very_professional clean and sweet
-PRON- be never_disappoint -PRON- always exceed in -PRON- thought and expectation of what -PRON- have in mind when -PRON- walk_in
-PRON- love breakfast and -PRON- think snooze do a decent job
but only when -PRON- go in
when -PRON- call_ahead 50 of the time -PRON- order be incorrect
-PRON- be small thing like forget cheese in -PRON- scramble or -PRON- extra hollandaise but these kind_of thing add up
the food be consistently good though the hash_brown be sometimes a_bit undercooked
-PRON- be good but try some other breakfast place before -PRON- make up -PRON- mind to wait an_hour
-PRON- husband and -PRON- have an_excellent breakfast on saturday morning
wonderful service and fantastic coffee
yes -PRON- be expensive but so be everything in_las_vegas
breakfast the next_morning at the terrace in the wynn although a couple dollar less expensive be not nearly as good nor as nice of an experience by a long shot
bad place ever
horrible establishment particularly for man who -PRON- try to rip_off
-PRON- have be twice and both time be awful
-PRON- pedicure last 15_minute and -PRON- charge -PRON- $ 32.00
-PRON- also cut -PRON- and do_not apologize
under no circumstance should man go there
-PRON- wish there be an option for no star in this review
super healthy relatively cheap and incredibly delicious
sushi fuku be like the chipotle of sushi with -PRON- simple yet personalize option of sushi a bowl or sushi burrito
-PRON- be completely awesome and incredibly satisfying
inari topping be a must_try
-PRON- coworker and -PRON- have be look to try new place in the area
so naturally -PRON- take to yelp for assistance

the hummus -PRON- order never come
the burger -PRON- be go to order also do_not come because the server barely come_back enough time for -PRON- to place that order
-PRON- take over 45_minute to get one beer
the good part be after -PRON- tell the server to cancel -PRON- next round the manager come over to apologize and say -PRON- want to make -PRON- right
-PRON- stick around for another 15_min watch -PRON- not get -PRON- -PRON- beer not rush out -PRON- food or assist in any_other way
bad service and bad management -PRON- have see in a very long_time
-PRON- will not be back
jambalaya be overprice for what -PRON- receive
flavor be bland as_well
-PRON- do_not have any beer
so -PRON- can_not rate that aspect
the menu be expensive for average sport_bar fare
first_off
they're get one_star for cheesy bread
that be -PRON-
horrible service tonight for -PRON- group
where do -PRON- begin
take 15_minute to receive -PRON- bottle_of wine along_with another 10_minute
wait for -PRON- bottle_of water
meat be tasty for about the 15_minute when -PRON- receive -PRON-
after that the meat stop come around even_though -PRON- card be up on green
the meat jockey be be still walk_around but seem to ignore -PRON- table
the table next to -PRON- also receive the salad_bar treatment
really disappointed in the service as -PRON- have be wait for this dining_experience for a few_week now
decide while wait twenty_minute for the check that -PRON- will probably not return
how can -PRON- go_wrong
-PRON- have the view of the san_francisco skyline ton_of amazing food option that -PRON- help cook and take_care_of -PRON- get to bring -PRON- own booze and everyone be so nice and informative
by_far the good groupon purchase ever
and if groupon be not an option -PRON- would have spend that money without fail
-PRON- learn so_many awesome thing_about how to bbq that -PRON- have take -PRON- home and use -PRON-
do -PRON-
well_worth -PRON-
dr. stacey mary anne and the whole staff be fantastic
dr. stacey be specialize as an orthodontist and pediatric dentist
-PRON- be the only dual specialist in nevada
if -PRON- be a parent this be a dental gold mine
simply state the food here be absolutely_delicious
the food be very savory and the staff be incredibly pleasant
-PRON- be a pleasure to dine here and -PRON- look_forward_to future visit
wow -PRON- do_not think -PRON- could be that bad
but -PRON- be
-PRON- get a margarita and the pizza have not taste despite supposedly have fresh mozzarella basil tomato_sauce on -PRON-
-PRON- taste bread and salt
the sauce be water_down and runny
the cheese be lunpy and inconsistent additional topping be a 1.50
-PRON- be glad -PRON- get none
well -PRON- guess -PRON- will keep the pizza for -PRON- am hangover
-PRON- have two_star for the staff and free gelato
-PRON- water_glass be never less_than 3\/4 full
superb water attentiveness
but what be with the leather holster
-PRON- have be to the jailhouse a_few time now and -PRON- absolutely_love -PRON-
the calamari be the good -PRON- have ever have
the ingredrient be fresh and the flavor be creative
yeah -PRON- be loud but if -PRON- be too_loud for -PRON- -PRON- be not -PRON- kinda place
-PRON- husband and -PRON- like support local_business and hear local band
-PRON- get to do both at the jailhouse
and the service be top_notch
-PRON- make -PRON- feel_like family
wish -PRON- could give this_place negative_star
the food be over price and the quality be poor but what top -PRON- all off be the rude staff
-PRON- come in think customer_service be something every staff_member should be proud to have
the male employee behind the counter keep star at -PRON- when -PRON- come in as -PRON- order and when -PRON- sit_down to eat
-PRON- then pretend to clean a table near -PRON- only to use -PRON- as an_excuse to come over and ask -PRON- if -PRON- have -PRON- cell_phone on
-PRON- then say give -PRON- to -PRON- babe so -PRON- can add -PRON- digit to -PRON- not only offensive but over the top rude
-PRON- get up and leave
the owner need to sit_down with -PRON- under train staff and either fire -PRON- all or al least train -PRON- to be nice
never_go_back again
-PRON- may be gear towards kid
-PRON- kid like -PRON-
but -PRON- husband and -PRON- be not impressed at all
do_not_waste -PRON- money on category a or b ticket
-PRON- be a really small theater
-PRON- should either sit_at the poncho section to get some closeup action for the kid or anywhere_else
-PRON- be not the kind_of show that -PRON- would want to see -PRON- again
-PRON- think the recycled percussion old show that -PRON- see a few_year back be even good_than this overprice one
great off the strip dining easy_parking and good_than good food
much respect to tom posthumously who not only wear those cool brim hat while on the sideline coach the cowboys but sure know_how to carry on after football with some good grub
-PRON- have be a handful of time to this_location ya_know -PRON- be a chain right
-PRON- have a menu of mainly seafood item hence the name hello easy\/peasy quick lunch and near fine_dining as the light dim in the evening
if that be not enough -PRON- offer a terrific happy_hour with all kind_of special and tv_'s feature all the sport -PRON- can handle
service can be a little_slow perhaps -PRON- be the staffing level vs training or caliber
but all the server manager and hostess have be super_nice and friendly each_time -PRON- have go
go for the first_time and the customer_service be outstanding
have a coffee and scone delicious
decor be welcome
will_definitely go_back
-PRON- take -PRON- scruffy here today for a self wash
-PRON- have always take -PRON- long haired dog to a groomer but decide to give this one a go -PRON- as -PRON- be too short notice for the groomer
-PRON- do_not want to wash -PRON- at home because of the mess
wag and wash be a great experience the process be easy and -PRON- clean up the mess for -PRON-
-PRON- do take some time get -PRON- long haired dog brush and bath and dry brush again take a couple of hour of work but -PRON- be very glad to leave the hair there and not have to take -PRON- home and clean -PRON- out of -PRON- own bathroom
-PRON- be able_to add on a nail trim from -PRON- staff quick and easy
-PRON- also have a cute doggy bakery and -PRON- sell nice doggy supply
-PRON- buy a new collar and leash
the staff be excellent nathan james and beau -PRON- think that be right
all be super_friendly and helpful
-PRON- can tell that -PRON- work there because -PRON- genuinely love dog
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- first experience with ethiopian food
all -PRON- can say be wow

after visit vegas 4 time -PRON- be finally drag here by one of -PRON- girlfriend on -PRON- recent_trip
-PRON- have hear really good thing_about this buffet so naturally -PRON- would be really inclined to go try
needless_to_say -PRON- be very_disappointed in the food
the food be endless and be split from all different part of the world
from dimsum to italian to mexican to seafood
-PRON- name -PRON- -PRON- probably have -PRON-
the presentation be beautiful
the most disappointing thing be that none_of the food be hot
at first -PRON- think maybe -PRON- be -PRON- until one of the other girl at the table mention the same_thing
on_top_of cold food the flavor of most of the food be bland
-PRON- would think for the amount_of money spend on the buffet the food would be good
-PRON- have have other buffet in_vegas and sadly enough this be not the good like what everyone make -PRON- to be
so long_story_short -PRON- wait for the hot pizza to come_out the oven and eat pizza on the other_hand the staff be very_nice and very_attentive for -PRON- be so busy
-PRON- be unfortunate that -PRON- will not be return back here unless -PRON- be again -PRON- own free will
hoorah for district
this be one of -PRON- first ever venture into leslieville despite 3_year of live in_toronto and while -PRON- can_not say -PRON- be a huge_fan_of the neighbourhood
-PRON- be just not -PRON- style -PRON- can say district modern japanese bistro be a great little spot
the restaurant be small dark and intimate with seating for maybe 30 or so
-PRON- arrive at 6_p.m. on friday and most of the table be reserve for 7_p.m. seating
the waitress give -PRON- a table anyway
and -PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- would try not to linger too_long
the food be mean to be shared\/tapa style
-PRON- have a good selection of cold and hot appetizer soup salad sashimi and maki
-PRON- try edamame sweet_potato wedge and the tuna tartar follow_by two of the specialty maki roll the district roll and the red dragon roll -PRON- will attach photo
the food be beautiful serve and -PRON- love everything
the speciality roll be both amazing
big prop to -PRON- waitress too -PRON- be truly awesome
-PRON- be great at follow_up and make small talk with -PRON-
-PRON- have no_problem get the avocado in both roll sub with cucumber -PRON- friend have an intolerance for avocado

usually if -PRON- ask the front_desk for a great view -PRON- get one
secondly the gaming be second to none
slot that pay off way more_than strip slot or even downtown and the absolute best blackjack game in_town
the house advantage be nearly zero
lastly -PRON- can_not beat the value
a huge clean comfortable nice room for very a way more_than reasonable_price
-PRON- hope this_place stay open forever

love that there be a grand lux downstairs where -PRON- can get decent food for decent price at 3 a.m.
also the noodle place at the venetian sportsbook be walk distance
das diner haben wir zufällig auf der suche nach einem dessert entdeckt
die bedienungen sind freundlich die karte lässt keine wünsche offen und_die preise sind auch in ordnung
ob das
diner für_ein mittagessen geeignet ist mag ich nicht beurteilen
aber für_ein getränk oder ein dessert kann ich es nur wärmsten empfehlen
-PRON- decide to stop in here for lunch on -PRON- way back to the office
despite the run_down building and awful interior -PRON- be be very busy
-PRON- steal glimpse of other customer good as -PRON- be eat and everything look delicious and appear to be authentic_mexican_food
-PRON- ask the girl in front of -PRON- if -PRON- have eat_here before and
-PRON- say not since -PRON- be 10_year old and be excited to order -PRON- old favorite plate of a chicken burrito with bean and rice
-PRON- say the chicken be juicy and delicious
so -PRON- order a chicken taco and a shredded_beef taco to go
-PRON- also order a dozen flower tortilla because -PRON- know flour tortilla
the chicken be good but be not -PRON- favorite
the shredded_beef taco be amazing
not too greasy full of flavor with just the basic of cheese and lettuce
-PRON- also give -PRON- a side of -PRON- red salsa which be garlicky and yummy
next_time -PRON- go yes -PRON- will be back
-PRON- will try a machaca burrito or -PRON- cheese enchilada
this_place truly be a hole_in the wall authentic_mexican_food restaurant
la scarpa be locate_in the pool promenade shop
bellagio shoe and accessory range_from high to low end
d&g dior manolo
the cheap stuff be tacky and questionable
3_star sketchy pushy sa
messy display similar to what -PRON- would find at low quality knockoff shoe store
1st timer here
-PRON- love the product but what really set -PRON- back be -PRON- customer_service
rhonda help -PRON- pick -PRON- rare size 32x34 and have plenty_of recommendation on what look good with what
-PRON- be easy to remember bad customer_service but people do_not realize how un often -PRON- be for someone to be so pleasant that -PRON- remember -PRON- for good customer_service
-PRON- will_definitely be back
fyi -PRON- have man 's dress pant shirt polo suit sock and shoe
a ton_of option to_choose_from
-PRON- have -PRON- son 's bday party here
-PRON- say -PRON- be the good birthday ever
so -PRON- think that speak for -PRON- as -PRON- be extremely difficult to make a 17 yr old and all -PRON- friend happy
-PRON- defiantly win some brownie point here
the only bad thing be -PRON- get kind_of pricey well_worth -PRON- though
oh and -PRON- wish -PRON- have some_sort_of awn for the picnic area
other_than_that -PRON- be great
super_helpful staff and great fun
oh -PRON- also let u bring in -PRON- own food and ice chest if u want
obviously u can_not bring in booze
outstanding service an intimidate large wine_list and great steak
-PRON- stop in while pass_by in search of a place to have dinner
there be a lot_of people and the price seem reasonable but totally not worth -PRON-
-PRON- order the hot and sour_soup eggplant and garlic and kong pao chicken for two people
the hot and sour_soup be not that great
while there be plenty_of ingredient -PRON- be basically all sour and not spicy at all
so soup be a pass for sure
the eggplant and garlic be way_too sweet and have way_too_much sauce
the eggplant be beyond drench in sweet sauce and the eggplant be borderline mushy
the kong pao chicken be not spicy at all
while there be lot_of peanut water chestnut and tender chicken -PRON- be way_too_salty
the server pretty_much ignore -PRON- for the most_part
even when try to get the bill the one male server do_not seem to respond to -PRON- request and just walk_away -PRON- be not that busy place be less_than 1\/3 full when -PRON- try to pay so no excuse for -PRON- behavior
and the server be not able_to answer very simple question like if the chicken dish would be sweet or not -PRON- get -PRON- with language barrier but -PRON- be a simple question that -PRON- should know
-PRON- find that this_place most_likely cater to westerners as that be what the majority_of the crowd be
if -PRON- want authentic chinese_food go elsewhere in chinatown where -PRON- do_not mask the flavor with a lot_of sauce salt or sugar
this be -PRON- second_time -PRON- come
and -PRON- can say wow
awesome food -PRON- have a slice of pizza that taste amazing
-PRON- do_not only sell pizza -PRON- sell many type_of different italian food lasagna pasta and sandwich
-PRON- have good sweet too
-PRON- be travel to toronto last_week and make a stop at square one
-PRON- be from toronto and spend a lot_of time in california for school
so -PRON- get to really know frozen_yogurt during the surge in the early 2000 's
-PRON- need a yogurt fix during -PRON- shopping and since -PRON- already know yogen fruz be garbage and date -PRON- decide to try this new place call qoola
-PRON- claim to be all organic and the lady read -PRON- a laundry list of all the benefit which be fine although -PRON- hope -PRON- know that pretty_much all frozen_yogurt can claim to be be healthy than ice_cream anything more_than that be just salesmanship
long_story_short
this_place do_not measure up to the good
toronto in_general for some_reason be miss the good fro yo brand
for full service -PRON- absolutely can_not beat pinkberry
-PRON- actually can_not believe that -PRON- have not make -PRON- way to eastern canada yet but -PRON- be sure -PRON- will
for self_serve there be nothing good_than yogurtland another brand that have not make -PRON- way to canada
as much as -PRON- hate american brand some be just good
bottom_line skip this_place and try some home grow until pinkberry or yogurtland arrive then mississauga and toronto will be in for a real treat
-PRON- have the cookie and cream at_this_location and -PRON- leave a terrible after taste and almost feel_like a film on -PRON- tongue after
plus -PRON- too_expensive for not be a leader in the category like the aforementioned
-PRON- love -PRON- strawberry drink a lot
the service be quick and very_friendly
good part -PRON- love the price
come_here on a friday around 1 p.m. for brunch pay_$ 36\/per person
expect so_much more since -PRON- read some good review be very_disappointed
-PRON- will not be return
con -old food
all hot food be cold not even a hint_of warmness -there be absolutely no quality in the food taste_like any random buffet -PRON- can eat anywhere -sushi seem_like -PRON- come from a prepackag be not make fresh do_not even see a sushi chief -asian\/sushi section be the poor section -pho
broth be tasteless taste more like warm water
broth be not even hot enough to soften the noodle -no creativity in the pasta section pizza be disgusting pro -great dessert section
-beef cut be not bad -quick line or maybe no one in line because the buffet suck
conveniently_locate near orea college which be great
pricing be reasonable and the food be fresh
-PRON- be very convenient and reasonable for coffee salad and lunch
amazing aerial homoerotic muscle half naked man everywhere elaborate costume funny amazing feat of strength acrobatic like -PRON- have never see surreal unreal awesome music awe shock and amazement funny
-PRON- could go on and on with more to describe what be the most amazing cirque_show -PRON- have ever see

awesome
-PRON- love use this_place as a meeting spot to chat and eat
this taiwanese restaurant be pretty_good and -PRON- love -PRON- boba tea drink
-PRON- bobas be pretty fresh not rubbery and chewy like other place
-PRON- have be go to this_place since high_school and would chill and relax here on the weekend play card and socialize
the reason_why i give this 3_star be because -PRON- service suck
-PRON- take_forever to take -PRON- order or to clean up -PRON- do_not check on -PRON-
then again what asian restaurant ever give good service
so -PRON- be pretty use to -PRON-
-PRON- give -PRON- a 3 1\/2_star too_bad yelp do_not do 1\/2s
hehe -PRON- would still go_back here
-PRON- be a great place to chill and socialize while grab some food and drink that be pretty_good
just do_not expect good service
-PRON- highly_recommend get the passion fruit tea and for the food get the pork_chop
go with friend from out of town after see -PRON- on dd&d.
food be excellent and ingredient be fresh
someone check on -PRON- twice during -PRON- meal to make_sure everything be ok
will definatley be go again
this_place a have a really good burger and great fried pickle
-PRON- love how -PRON- can choose the size of -PRON- burger but sometimes the bread overwhelm the patty when -PRON- order a small burger
everything be great the appetizer -PRON- think -PRON- be the fry egg and bacon dish that win -PRON- over
from there the entree sear tuna live_up to expectation and finish off with donut and 3 different dip
there be a surprise of cotton_candy at the end of the meal that -PRON- can_not help but finish off even if -PRON- be do
-PRON- will be back again
love love love_this_place
be prepared this be a call in -PRON- order delivery or stop in and order place
now that -PRON- know get ready for a fantastical experience for -PRON- taste_bud
the pizza be different_than what -PRON- find elsewhere
sanfratello 's use very high_quality ingredient include 100 scamorza cheese and
yes -PRON- make a difference
-PRON- be also a huge_fan_of pizza sauce do right and sanfratello be get -PRON- down perfectly
-PRON- also have really good pasta not sticky gooey or stuff that be be sit around in a pan and stellar meatball
how be this for a change of pace
sanfratello 's have rib
-PRON- be too stuff with pizza salad and pasta to try the rib so that will have to wait for next_time
definitely consider sanfratello be for a refreshing change of pace on the valley 's pizza scene
-PRON- be not a serious artist just someone_who dabble in ink\/colored pencil\/watercolor pencil drawing
but this store be great
the price be good enough that -PRON- be actually a good deal there than to order the same product online -PRON- be talk mainly about -PRON- pens\/pencils\/eraser etc
that be a pretty rare thing these day
and as the other have say the staff be great
-PRON- be just real down to earth people_who do -PRON- good to be helpful and coincidentally -PRON- really know -PRON- stuff
the store space -PRON- be pretty_cool if a_bit cramp an_old metal spiral staircase lead to a basement level where most of -PRON- paper\/canvas be keep
-PRON- be an enjoyable place all around
if -PRON- need serious art supply there be no reason to go_anywhere_else in_madison
this_place have the good toddy
-PRON- have go to starbucks earlier today and get the toddy with coconut milk
and -PRON- be still bitter
-PRON- know black cat have smooth toddy and -PRON- be crave -PRON- for the rest_of the day
-PRON- get a medium black toddy and -PRON- definitely do_not_disappoint
so smooth -PRON- do_not even need cream
-PRON- kid and -PRON- love good donut
-PRON- come more_often than -PRON- care to admit
-PRON- actually prefer -PRON- over bosa
close to dutch bros too which make -PRON- a perfect yet dangerous morning stop
amy the manager be great
give this salon a try for a mani or pedi
-PRON- also have a location at camelback and 44th street
be from bay_area and have so_many good raman joint to try really make -PRON- hard to find good one elsewhere
monta have be on -PRON- to try list for a very long_time
but every_time -PRON- try to go -PRON- be pack to the gill
luckily this time -PRON- be out for an_early dinner and be lucky to be seat within 15_minute
this_place be small max cap at about 40
order the miso_raman request spicy which be just a chili paste add in that -PRON- mix into the soup -PRON-
the raman be good
a little chewy a little al_dente
the broth be good
the chili paste give -PRON- more flavor
great food just not worth any wait long than 30_min
this haunt house be awesome
the first house in the 13th floor be a great experience the second house call zombieland be not so_much_fun
the total experience last about 45_minute which be well_worth the money spend
some people be complain_about have to crawl in zombieland but there be an option to go around the crawlspace
-PRON- would have to agree with other that management do allow too_many people to walk_through the haunt house at the same time which cause the people in the front of the line to get the initial shock and the people towards the rear of the line to anticipate what be around the corner
the set piece be outstanding and the special effect be great as_well
-PRON- would strongly recommend go to this haunt house over other in the valley like scream park and jack and jill 's haunt hill
bridal path invitations be the bad part of -PRON- 1.5 year of wedding planning
due_to -PRON- incompetence -PRON- lose almost $_1000 and have to reprint -PRON- invite at another company
this_company make -PRON- wait 2_month for defective invitation and throughout the grueling 2_month process -PRON- be rude arrogant unapologetic and slow
-PRON- hire -PRON- back in january
-PRON- look good on the surface nice store nice social medium page etc
but then -PRON- insist -PRON- pay in full in_advance
that be when -PRON- all change and -PRON- go mia
-PRON- have to email and call several_time just to start the process
every_single step after that be just an_absolute disaster
first take -PRON- almost a week to send -PRON- the template for invitation wording
then -PRON- send proof with mistake such_as wrong year thing misalign different font that do_not match
each_time -PRON- would ask for edit -PRON- make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be ask for the world
for even the simple change such_as change the font size -PRON- would take a full week to send a revise proof
basically a full month pass before -PRON- have a draft invitation that be ready to print as a sample
then the real fun begin
-PRON- receive the print sample at the end of february and none_of the most_recent edit be incorporate
even bad -PRON- add more mistake
the writing be not center border be uneven and the ink on -PRON- rsvp sized card be fade
the funniest mistake which just illustrate -PRON- incompetence be -PRON- forget to add -PRON- wedding date on the card cover even_though -PRON- be on every proof -PRON- send over the last 5 week lol
honestly -PRON- think that be the end
but -PRON- be not
after sort this mess out -PRON- finally print all -PRON- material in early march
-PRON- have gently remind the company 's co founder and creative director -PRON- can look up who that be -PRON- that -PRON- be way behind but -PRON- only blame -PRON- and behave very rudely to -PRON-
upon opening card -PRON- realize that -PRON- final product be just as terrible as the experience -PRON- have for the previous 6 week 1
the sample envelope -PRON- give -PRON- be linen lead -PRON- to believe that be what -PRON- be get in the final invite
but the final envelope be not
have -PRON- tell -PRON- that the nice envelope cost more -PRON- would have pay
2
the rsvp size card look_like someone have cut -PRON- at home
the border be so uneven that there be no way -PRON- could give -PRON- to anyone
3
the bellybands which be suppose to wrap around the invitation be order in wrong size so do_not fit
to fix -PRON- -PRON- take more gold material and glue the two piece together on each invite lol
remind -PRON- of elementary school art class
reluctantly -PRON- agree to redo some piece but ask for more money of_course lol and to come_back in another 2_week
-PRON- show_up in 2_week none_of the stuff be redone
the rsvp size card or envelope be not reprint and bellyband material be not here yet
-PRON- could have tell -PRON- this before
-PRON- tell -PRON- to come_back the next week for the bellyband material after which -PRON- would assemble the invite
plus -PRON- make -PRON- mother wait 2_hour for -PRON- to print the thing -PRON- have two week to do
-PRON- miss a work meeting and lunch because of -PRON- that day
-PRON- decide that even if -PRON- have to pay more money at another printer there be absolutely no way -PRON- be go_back here
-PRON- tell -PRON- mom to take whatev print material be ready and to go
-PRON- then go to another printer who sort everything out and assemble -PRON- all within 3 business day
-PRON- do_not need to order the bellyband material -PRON- be skilled enough to fix the invite in such a professional way that -PRON- look perfect
-PRON- do end_up pick_up the bellyband material from bridal path invitations when -PRON- be ready and guess_what -PRON- order the wrong material
-PRON- be a different texture and different colour
so_glad -PRON- go to the other printer
-PRON- social medium photo be nice but -PRON- be so easy to print out a couple good piece and stage a nice instagram photo
do_not be fool
save -PRON- the time and money
pay more but do_not go to bridal path invitations
not only will -PRON- not recommend this_company to people -PRON- have already start actively tell -PRON- friend get marry in_toronto to ensure -PRON- avoid this_place
-PRON- mom_'s word -PRON- turn -PRON- happy occasion into the most stressful one edit- company 's reply be proof of -PRON- defensiveness have many lie
-PRON- never speak to adrienne during 2_month process so how -PRON- can even comment
yes -PRON- give -PRON- $ 180 back after -PRON- insist on full refund
to be crystal clear
-PRON- reprint from another printer
rsvp card and envelope and fix the poor assembly job -PRON- do
cost -PRON- hundred more but good quality
fyi adrienne 's reply below be the most professional interaction -PRON- have have so_far with the company
funny how tone change once a customer call -PRON- out publicly through a review
good riddance
nom nom nom
-PRON- want bbq\/hawaiian food while visit az
so the bf take -PRON- to leo 's -PRON- get the chicken combo which come with teriyaki chicken katsu with rice and macaroni salad with a generous_amount of veggie

the teriyaki be more towards the sweet side but still very good
the restaurant be locate_in a small plaza across from the plaza that barnes and noble sit in

also the only contractor that supply a detail schematic of the fence install with the proposal
-PRON- inform -PRON- of that up front without_any additional work on -PRON- part
-PRON- highly_recommend sunset fence and will use -PRON- in the future if -PRON- purchase a new home
this casino be really outdated and in need of some major revamping
-PRON- be quite a shame consider that the radisson that be adjacent to the casino actually be a lovely place
consider the many_other new and modern casino that exist in the phoenix metro area this_place do_not really seem to be much of a destination except maybe for local or people look only to gamble and who do_not care_about overall ambiance
-PRON- would opt_for any_other phoenix_area casino before come to this_place
go to this_place three_time with different group when -PRON- first open and never_go_back
the service be extremely slow the order be wrong the price be high the portion be small
look_at recent review thing may have change
will give -PRON- another try
-PRON- husband and -PRON- eat breakfast here last sunday and be not disappoint
the place be not too_busy
so -PRON- be easy to walk_in and grab a table
-PRON- order the hash mash which be corn_beef scramble_egg potato and cheese in a skillet
-PRON- be very fill and delicious
however -PRON- do put way_too_much cheese on_top and after a while -PRON- become too_much
-PRON- would order the hash mash again minus the cheese
-PRON- husband order pancake with a side of bacon
the pancake be big and fluffy and the bacon be thick and tasty not fatty and floppy
-PRON- look_at the other item on the menu and everything_else sound great
lot_of deli sandwich soup and -PRON- dessert look very yummy

-PRON- love the large_selection of beer and the burger -PRON- have be amazing
if -PRON- want fry though -PRON- be extra which -PRON- order to share and some cheese_curd
the downside of when -PRON- be there be -PRON- have a bar crawl bus that stop_by and of_course -PRON- be -PRON- last stop and -PRON- become extremely loud and because -PRON- be sit_at the bar to eat all the people be try to reach between -PRON- to order drink even_though there be plenty_of open bar_area for -PRON- to order at
overall -PRON- be good food and the staff be friendly and attentive -PRON- would come_back_again

the pie be excellent but could possibly need a little longer in the oven and the salad be great except for a_few large lettuce piece -PRON- try not to look_like a crazy person stuff in a huge bite when possible lol
but those be such small thing that -PRON- can give -PRON- 5_star

and -PRON- be really pissed off about that
-PRON- could_barely hear the waitress with all -PRON- training explain the food to -PRON-
and since -PRON- do_not provide a print menu for the chef_'s tasting_menu -PRON- have no clue what some of the thing -PRON- be eat even be
-PRON- give -PRON- disposable chopstick and not the nice kind for f 's sake nobu are you joke
$ 350 + dinner pathetic
say with disgust and distain
-PRON- even ask for good chopstick and be tell -PRON- do_not have -PRON-
-PRON- be a japanese restraunt
-PRON- be stunned
f@% stunned topper
after all the hype and the promise of excellent quality food that will be remember -PRON- can_not accurately describe one thing -PRON- eat that night
-PRON- be a foodie
the fact_that -PRON- can_not recall one menu_item can only mean one thing nobu -PRON- be not worth -PRON- salt
-PRON- will_never go_back
-PRON- will not encourage other to fritter a night away in_vegas that would be better spend in a fine_dining establishment that be not have an identity crisis
-PRON- guy have issue and -PRON- be shocked at -PRON- overall rating
clearly be cool and -PRON- say this with cheek be enough to keep -PRON- in business in_las_vegas and apparently in la
if this exact restaurant be place in san_francisco or new_york -PRON- would not last a year
the food critic would have -PRON- head
definitely_worth -PRON-
the decor be lovely and -PRON- be a good atmosphere
but the important part be the food
this be probably as good as phoenix can get -PRON- will_never be amazing italian the cook can_not go to a nearby dairy and get fresh cheese -PRON- can_not go to a local butcher and handpick the meat and -PRON- doubt -PRON- have the time to make the pasta by hand all of which -PRON- do in italy
but that be say -PRON- do a good job with the ingredient that -PRON- have access to and everything be fine
good_than olive_garden and be not that what -PRON- be look for
the staff be not effusive in greeting but definitely not rude
-PRON- server an_old gentleman be courteous and friendly and spot on the service
plate use
replace
fork use
replace
new dish for every course perfect
and frankly if -PRON- go during_happy_hour with half off appetizer real appetizer not cheapo fry stuff option like calamari mussel antipasto bruchetta etc life be pretty_darn good
-PRON- be go to keep this one short 1_star for the elevators -PRON- have to wait in line sometimes for 20_minute or more before -PRON- could get on an elevator especially_during checkout on sunday
-PRON- walk down 21 flight instead
2_star for location all the way at the south end of the strip
a little far_from everything except the airport
restaurants shop hotel entertainment very expensive
example
$_17 sunscreen and $_6 bottle_of water
wth
3_star for the room comfy and clean but -PRON- can hear everything in the hall
the wave pool way_too crowded and the pool be just kind_of gross
lazy river fun but do_not come with flotation device
so -PRON- just walk_through -PRON- ton_of child there
4_star for landshark lagoon peaceful fun 21 + only great waitress service cornhole\/bag hot_tub and a nice shallow pool to wade through
-PRON- spend most of -PRON- time at the pool or out and about in_vegas
-PRON- would_rather stay_at a more centrally_locate hotel next_time
this review be for the location on baseline
-PRON- be a new_patient today through -PRON- groupon deal and be extremely unhappy with the customer_service of this office
-PRON- have a very complicated schedule
so -PRON- call_ahead before even purchase -PRON- groupon to ask if all service could be render at once because -PRON- be unlikely to be able_to get off enough time to have two appointment
-PRON- assure -PRON- that appointment usually take one hour and that -PRON- would take_care_of -PRON- exam cleaning and x_ray
at -PRON- appointment today none_of -PRON- documentation have -PRON- name spell right and when -PRON- receive -PRON- exam and x_ray -PRON- get to listen to the dentist fight with the scribe because the proper paperwork have not be print out
-PRON- then sit in the exam room for an_hour and a half before someone come in and tell -PRON- -PRON- hygenist be completely book and that -PRON- would have to reschedule
first -PRON- be not_sure_why -PRON- have to sit in -PRON- exam room for so long for -PRON- to send -PRON- away
second -PRON- be tell that the reason be that there be already patient in the waiting room
how be -PRON- that these other people have high priority than a patient already check in and wait for an_hour and a half
-PRON- tooth have no issue and -PRON- spend longer argue_with -PRON- and send -PRON- away than -PRON- would have take to just clean -PRON- tooth
ultimately -PRON- be happy to take -PRON- money but not offer the service promise
this office obviously do_not have -PRON- act together
and -PRON- would never_go_back
-PRON- have be to the scottsdale location on two separate occasion within the past 2_month
both have be a total letdown
while the facility be pretty well design and the food be not bad pretty mediocre but do -PRON- really expect -PRON- to be more
the service from two different server be terrible
-PRON- be ridiculously slow -PRON- should not take over 30_minute to get a check
so -PRON- could pay and leave and the server seem to be completely uninterested in be there much_less in have -PRON- as a patron
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- will ever visit another twin peaks location
-PRON- have be stay_at a hotel on the square for a_few day and -PRON- have already be to fromagination twice and will probably go_back to buy gift again before -PRON- leave tomorrow
-PRON- be comparable to murray 's cheese shop in nyc
there be a wide_variety of cheese as_well_as preserve chocolate wine\/beer ice_cream and cheese related kitchen gadget knife block book etc
-PRON- serve sandwich soup and salad as_well
-PRON- always have sample too and the service be very_friendly and knowledgeable
one_star lose because -PRON- do_not make a grill_cheese sandwich
how can -PRON- be a cheese shop and not do grill_cheese
-PRON- also do_not appreciate the tude when -PRON- ask if -PRON- have a grill_cheese sandwich
-PRON- can read the menu thank -PRON- -PRON- be just wonder how a cheese shop that sell sandwich can_not just get a sandwich press and serve the most delicious cheese sandwich there be
that be all
be aware of this kungfu tea be different_than the one locate_in china town
-PRON- ask for ginger green milk_tea as -PRON- normally order at another location add boba + taro+r be
no taro top
can't add ginger flavor to milk_tea neither
fine -PRON- order a large taro milk_tea with boba and red be little sugar
the drink turn_out to be super sweet in a regular size
second_time -PRON- make -PRON- a wrong size of drink
not really frozen custard more like just soft served ice_cream = the burger be okay the california style burger be like a single cheeseburger from in n
out
but -PRON- do like -PRON- fry crispy and very thin
the menu be mostly ice_cream and sundae
nothing very note worthy of this_place kinda cheap have drive_thru and big sit in area and friendly_staff
host a business dinner for 9 last_night
never be here but -PRON- be highly_recommend
-PRON- be very_impressed_with the ambiance and service
the food be fabulous and the portion be huge
-PRON- start with the hummus and pita -PRON- could eat just this and be thrilled and the tha dig
entree chicken barg be fabulous
-PRON- be pleasantly_surprised to see the bill be under_$ 400
include wine and cocktail
great place -PRON- will be back
-PRON- actually come_here pretty often
do_not_know_why
restroom be such a mess -PRON- should clean -PRON- more_often
service be not bad but not good -PRON- should hire more people because -PRON- be always busy but only have 2 or 3 people tend_to customer
-PRON- do_not get drink until second plate
-PRON- have to pay extra for drink do_not ask for water because -PRON- nasty
-PRON- do_not refill the good stuff like the oyster and crab
-PRON- could be there at_least and -PRON- will not refill -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- more of trick if -PRON- do_not want to refill -PRON-
-PRON- should just stop serve -PRON-
because that_s why -PRON- be there for
-PRON- egg_roll be huge
mongolian station be pretty_good and fast
salmon be good but often have bone
nice location
this be the kind_of theatre -PRON- can wear blue jean to
now half of -PRON- just roll -PRON- eye at -PRON- and the other half stop read probably because -PRON- be of the mindset that theatre = fancy and -PRON- do_not want to live in a world where uncultured canadian expat such_as -PRON- tromp around historical theatre in blue jean
-PRON- both would be wrong
because -PRON- too have live the last thirty year equate trip to the theatre with decadence
back home -PRON- would genuinely look_forward_to a trip to a venue like usher hall for those brief moment when -PRON- could stand in a beautiful dress swirl a glass of wine and engage in small talk_about the experimental nature of the current ballet before the light dim
and -PRON- shuffle -PRON- fancy ass self back to -PRON- fancy ass seat to take in some fancy ass theatre performance
-PRON- live for those moment
which be why -PRON- glee towards blue jean at usher hall hit -PRON- so strongly
back home -PRON- would have never imagine that a venue so beautiful could so often tip the scale between casual and fancy arse moment
sure usher hall put out many a reason to wear a beautiful dress and wax poetic about experimental artistic endeavor
but -PRON- also boast a surprising amount_of show that one can arrive in jean swirl wine and settle into something as comfortable and casual as a book signing
case in point
last_night -PRON- go to see david sedaris read at usher hall
and -PRON- keep point out how lovely -PRON- be to see 1
a venue that size sell out for an author 2 casually dress folk chat about book in such a beautiful setting and 3
a hugely diverse crowd of folk all age comfortably spend -PRON- monday_night among good humour
the set_up be simple a man a book a podium and yet -PRON- create a strangely intimate show for such a large space
-PRON- will_definitely_return to this venue in many an extravagant dress
-PRON- undoubtably look_forward_to that
but -PRON- must_say -PRON- be tickle pink that -PRON- live in a city where -PRON- have the same amount_of opportunity to arrive back here in whatev -PRON- happen to have wear that day
-PRON- speak volume to the personality of the city and make for an easy five_star for such a unique venue
this be probably -PRON- 1 go to spot in the area
-PRON- be affordable and -PRON- never really have to wait long for the food
if -PRON- sign_up for the text alert -PRON- can get -PRON- first drink free
today -PRON- come in with one of -PRON- coworker and -PRON- have brandon as -PRON- waiter
-PRON- be a nice young guy and get -PRON- food out to -PRON- pretty fast
-PRON- usually get a to go order every_time -PRON- come in and have -PRON- for lunch or dinner later
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_place
surprisingly good thai food in this hidden_gem
cashew chicken
shrimp chip with peanut_sauce
awesome
-PRON- have be a long_term lover of -PRON- beer and be when -PRON- hear -PRON- be open a venue on the street -PRON- live in
well -PRON- be very chuffed
-PRON- have be in for drink twice and one meal
the selection of beer be just alright
of_course i&g feature prominently but -PRON- feel -PRON- could have a wide_selection_of beer_on_tap compare to red squirrel or hanging bat for_example
something that really bug -PRON- on a thursday late afternoon
-PRON- be meet two people for a beer at 4 p.m. and when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be tell -PRON- could_not have a booth as -PRON- be for eat only
-PRON- be all empty
-PRON- fight -PRON- corner and get one in the end however -PRON- be reluctantly give
positive time the food be very_nice
-PRON- go with -PRON- mum and there be one fault the carrot and coriander soup have enough coriander in -PRON- to flavour 30 thai curry
-PRON- send -PRON- back and -PRON- be very apologetic and admit -PRON- be a wee bit strong
anyway that aside -PRON- burger be spot on and mother dear like -PRON- too
the staff be generally very_helpful despite the booth thing and keen to have a chat if -PRON- want -PRON-
there be one over rid thing for -PRON- though
the place be soul less
-PRON- do_not actually want to go there for a drink
-PRON- have be on two occasion just for drink with pal now and will not be rush back
very little atmosphere
-PRON- be all a_bit clinical
some may say too corporate
anyway -PRON- be perfectly pleasant -PRON- think -PRON- be just hop for more
good fast mexican_food place in the valley
1000x good then filly b 's or any_other place
-PRON- love -PRON- breakfast_burrito and -PRON- quesadilla can_not be beat
-PRON- wish -PRON- would advertise more because -PRON- could probably use the business
fat tuesday be a tradition that -PRON- have up keep for many_year
-PRON- get the mango margarita yard for $_11 plus a couple extra shot of rum for $_1 each
one of this be enough to get -PRON- waste for the rest_of the night
refill be only $_9 too
-PRON- have jello shot for $_1 each
-PRON- may or may not have have a handful of those too
the bartender be nice and friendly and very_helpful
visit the area and want to try this_place after see the other_review
overall -PRON- feel the customer_service be subpar
-PRON- be direct to the board of nail color and no one offer to help -PRON- find a color
-PRON- have a new technician thomasyne
-PRON- ask -PRON- colleague if -PRON- be hold the foot nail filer the correct way while -PRON- be use -PRON- on -PRON-
before the gel mani -PRON- have to quickly use -PRON- phone so -PRON- use -PRON-
when -PRON- be finish -PRON- be still on -PRON- phone as -PRON- be sit there wait for -PRON-
-PRON- then ask another colleague if the scrub need to be do before or after the gel
even -PRON- know the answer to that
-PRON- be be at aey for almost a week and -PRON- would have look more professional on -PRON- end if -PRON- prepp for what -PRON- need to do ahead of time
the bad part be the job be not do well and -PRON- unfortunately do_not have time for a redo
-PRON- hope the manager put more time into training or shadow -PRON- move_forward
at the end of -PRON- service no one say goodbye or thank -PRON- for come in
maybe -PRON- get spoil by that at -PRON- usual place
so -PRON- be -PRON- girl 's bday
and -PRON- know -PRON- would love a nothing bundt cake
-PRON- be -PRON- favorite cake and there be a very good reason
this_place have the most moist cake -PRON- have have in_town and -PRON- flavor be all awesome
not only do -PRON- take -PRON- order over the phone and have -PRON- ready for pick_up when -PRON- need -PRON- but -PRON- also arrange -PRON- and decorate -PRON- for the occasion free of charge
a friendly_staff a velvety moist cake and awesome detail orient service make this -PRON- favorite place for bday cake
ps
unsure
what flavor to get
try the white_chocolate raspberry
-PRON- be out of this_world
not a lot_of place can touch large 22.5 wheel anymore
-PRON- happen to have 22.5 's on -PRON- coach
and -PRON- be really glad that -PRON- find this_place
fast friendly and most of all fair
thank for the great service
i'll be back
what a terrible dining_experience
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- decide to try this restaurant because -PRON- want to go to a nice restaurant for -PRON- anniversary and because -PRON- be both wine lover
when -PRON- be seat at -PRON- table -PRON- server come over and start speak in spanish to -PRON-
neither of -PRON- be very fluent in spanish so -PRON- kindly ask -PRON- if -PRON- could speak to -PRON- in english
-PRON- reply be no
-PRON- should know the language so -PRON- must_try
first of all -PRON- realize that -PRON- should know a second language but a fine_dining restaurant be not the venue in which -PRON- would like to buff up on -PRON- spanish skill
next come the wine
that be delicious and the highlight of -PRON- experience
when -PRON- entree arrive the server do_not leave
-PRON- ask -PRON- about the wine in spanish and make -PRON- try to reply to -PRON- in spanish
-PRON- say -PRON- be not leave until -PRON- say -PRON- correctly
then -PRON- ask -PRON- where -PRON- be from and -PRON- reply san_diego
-PRON- want to know_how long the drive be
then then go on to say the reason -PRON- be ask be because the girl that -PRON- be date live in san_diego and -PRON- use to meet in barstow or victorville get a hotel room and then drive back -PRON- separate way
do -PRON- two think that -PRON- do the majority_of the driving
-PRON- do_not_matter now though -PRON- break up with -PRON-
but whatev first of all yes -PRON- do do the majority_of the driving
second of all -PRON- do_not want to hear_about -PRON- sexual escapade while -PRON- be try to eat -PRON- dinner which by the way be a terrible overcooked piece_of pork
not worth the money
get back to the hotel after dinner and about 4 hour_later -PRON- be both very sick from the food and spend the rest_of the night run to and from the bathroom
take -PRON- money and spend -PRON- elsewhere
-PRON- husband and -PRON- want a lay_back place to go for -PRON- first wedding anniversary and -PRON- choose to come_here
the food and service be excellent
-PRON- order the spinach dip as_an_appetizer and love -PRON-
for -PRON- main dish -PRON- order the crab_cake and -PRON- husband get the steak taco
both meal be outstanding and -PRON- waitress be awesome
can_not wit to go_back
decent coffee good tea
the staff be nice and that be the most_important thing really
-PRON- only_complaint be that sometimes the wifi do_not work even if -PRON- have the login
this be genius
like chipotle but greek food
-PRON- create -PRON- own hummus bowl
big portion and ton_of fresh option
-PRON- have be a customer of this great place since -PRON- first open -PRON- old location in 2009
-PRON- dad and -PRON- be regular there for year
-PRON- be no_longer around but -PRON- be still a customer forever and everytime
-PRON- go there
-PRON- remember the old time -PRON- have with -PRON- old man
-PRON- recently relocate to new_orleans so -PRON- can only eat there a_few time a year
however this clear cut be the good indian_food around
-PRON- have eat in california many_time
the food be the good
get the lamb boti masala lamb saag anything lamb
the goat be delicious
-PRON- be very good friend with the family and -PRON- treat all of -PRON- customer like family
-PRON- have be a regular at every indian_restaurant in_phoenix and this clearly trump -PRON- all
-PRON- will not be dissapoint come_here
in_fact -PRON- have about ten friend that be regular_customer still
okay food
okay selection
awful attitude from the waitress almost as if -PRON- be an inconvenience
may go there again
this hotel compare to some on the strip be not as great as other
with that say the hotel be in a great location
-PRON- stay in the 700 sq
foot suite which be a decent size but the couch that -PRON- come with look rather use and stain
disgusting
the casino need a renovation
the brown and tan of the carpet and decor look drab
the service be awesome and the spa request andrew as a masseuse be really nice
but with all that -PRON- think -PRON- will stay elsewhere next_time
-PRON- be back in_town
shrimp po'boy be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- love the decor and the cute menu board -PRON- hope -PRON- keep -PRON- that way
oh what a beautiful place
-PRON- just wish -PRON- have get there early to get a seat on the patio near the water fountain
between the four of -PRON- -PRON- order pasta and steak and -PRON- be all great
-PRON- love the bread -PRON- bring_out in the beginning with the olive spread
yummmmm
this_company give the most reasonable quote
-PRON- be very honest and do a great_job with -PRON- shower glass enclosure and -PRON- be -PRON- first_time remodel -PRON- worn out bathroom
absolutely happy with -PRON- service
-PRON- highly_recommend baja glass
-PRON- go to the bellafornia bakery cafe
-PRON- be a new place and nicely decorate
the server be very_friendly but disorganized
order anything be a big pain
-PRON- order a coffee tea and a smoothie
the smoothie be half price for only 2 dollar
would -PRON- go_back
maybe
there be not any_other cafe in the other area
with the recent renovation this be a worthy choice of a place to stay on the strip
the hotel be at an_excellent location in the middle_of the major casino hotel rate be very_reasonable
the room be clean and very roomy
the view be great
the front_desk could be very busy but with -PRON- platinum or diamond status check in be no_problem and move very quickly
first_off
amazing service
-PRON- server be both friendly and fast
-PRON- be very accommodate and care
the food be amazing
-PRON- have get the lemon big skinny pancake
and -PRON- be be perfectly sweet and crispy on the edge and soft in the center
perfect for just a light crepe\/pancake
the blueberry waffle be light and crispy
perfectly make and -PRON- can tell -PRON- be not make from a crappy box mix
-PRON- will_definitely be return
-PRON- have not be here for two year because -PRON- kinda hate wait in the line
however -PRON- friend be visit last_weekend
and -PRON- think this_place be worth go
-PRON- be not surprised to see a line at as early as 5:10pm
-PRON- be let in around 5:25
everyone that be let in at the same time be super experienced
-PRON- do_not even look_at the menu and order right_away and what -PRON- order seem super delicious and -PRON- finish way sooner than -PRON- friend and i.
-PRON- order a salmon appetizer yakitori chicken bimbimbap and ice_cream
all of -PRON- be delicious
besides the regular item on the menu -PRON- have more write on the wall
-PRON- would definitely try those next_time
-PRON- would suggest sit_at the bar if -PRON- be only one person or with one friend since -PRON- could see_how the chef work in the kitchen
-PRON- cooperate with each_other very well
-PRON- just move to to and need a new salon
-PRON- have a groupon so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a shot
the groupon do_not provide the service -PRON- say -PRON- would and -PRON- be only tell once -PRON- be in the seat
-PRON- definition of straightening be apparently a keratin straightening treatment that -PRON- claim keep -PRON- hair straight for 4 month but actually only smooth frizz and -PRON- still need to straighten everyday
blatant deception
-PRON- charge -PRON- 80 dollar for a dry hair_cut do people even do that
the hairstylist be nice but -PRON- be not happy with the cut or the treatment
-PRON- spend the whole time check -PRON- cellphone to ensure -PRON- have a ride home which make -PRON- feel_rush
-PRON- call to complain and get put on hold for more_than 10_min twice at which point -PRON- hang_up and then -PRON- write a politie email indicate -PRON- concern and hop -PRON- could work something out
-PRON- never bother to respond
the section of the salon -PRON- see be also noticeable dusty so -PRON- be not_sure what -PRON- clean routine be
if -PRON- value -PRON- hair- go_anywhere_else
this be -PRON- first day club in_vegas and -PRON- be not_too_bad
-PRON- be three of -PRON- girl on the guest_list
when -PRON- be on the guest_list -PRON- can get in free before 2 p.m.
-PRON- get there by 1:15 pm and the line be super long but -PRON- only wait 20_minute
a tip -PRON- can give -PRON- be only bring -PRON- wallet or lip gloss because the security up front go_through every pocket in -PRON- purse and throw out -PRON- pack of gum candy energy pill and allergy medicine
-PRON- be quite embarrassing have -PRON- put all the thing in -PRON- purse on the table literally while everyone be look_at -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- be go to a pool party not the airport
there be get to be a good way to search -PRON- thing without have the whole world watch -PRON-
anyways the music be good until zedd take over then -PRON- be all techno which -PRON- completely hate
if -PRON- be into -PRON- then -PRON- would have a blast
but that be not -PRON- style
-PRON- end_up leave an_hour and a half later
-PRON- go on sat
3\/26
and -PRON- be not_too_crowded
and -PRON- be easy to find a spot to put -PRON- stuff down and dip -PRON- toe in the pool
the staff be nice the water do_not get as dirty as -PRON- think -PRON- would and the price for drink be about the same price at the other club on the strip 1 shot of patron be $_18
yikes
-PRON- agree with other_reviewer that the view of strip be lovely
overall -PRON- be a nice vibe
the music be the only_downside to -PRON-
but -PRON- will be back again in one week
so -PRON- will give this_place another_chance
dr. libby and -PRON- staff be amazing compassionate people

although the food match that of strip steakhouse pricing the ribeye be delicious
the service be good and the overall experience be nice
4_star
quite worried about the large_portion after_read the review but the sun dry tomato with goat_cheese scramble_egg omelette come in a manageable quantity and be definitely enough to kick start a day in_vegas
fluffy scramble_egg be what -PRON- would expect from any good quality american breakfast and the hazelnut mocha overflow with goodness be a nice complement
though the line to get in be long and -PRON- be a busy morning once in the server be prompt polite and attentive
definitely_worth a visit if -PRON- stay on the strip
most of the time -PRON- be awesome and great but there be some random time -PRON- order wing and come really over cook
very_thorough inspection -PRON- be personally show each issue
super_helpful overall great customer_service
-PRON- be sure dr. gentile be a fine doctor and a good person but when when -PRON- husband and -PRON- be interview pediatric office -PRON- find dr. gentile to be annoy by -PRON- question about alternative shot schedule and -PRON- state that -PRON- only follow the apa 's vaccine schedule
and then -PRON- proceed to tell -PRON- what horrible thing may happen to -PRON- baby should -PRON- not follow the schedule
-PRON- understand that vaccine be important but -PRON- choose a different pediatric office because -PRON- live an organic lifestyle and choose to go with a variation of dr. sears shot schedule -PRON- kiddo do get all of the shot just more spread out and this other office be willing_to work with -PRON-
dr. gentile 's office be just not right for -PRON-
by the way -PRON- choose to go with desert shores pediatrics -PRON- be great
this be -PRON- third_time in_vegas this year
this be -PRON- vegas bucket list item and -PRON- make -PRON- happen this trip
absolutely no word be fit to describe this_place
experience be the only word that may be close
-PRON- be treat like royalty by every_single person there
-PRON- do_not_know_what to order so -PRON- ask -PRON- a price_range and ridiculously good look people keep bring -PRON- bite of all the item on the menu until -PRON- beg -PRON- to stop -PRON- want to keep go because -PRON- be borderline orgasmic but -PRON- stomach would not let -PRON-
the music be outstanding
and the side show
well when -PRON- finally notice -PRON- there be sooooo much beauty
all around -PRON- get lose in the moment a lot and ask -PRON- waiter -PRON- grab -PRON- like -PRON- be -PRON- good friend and take -PRON- on to -PRON- next adventure
-PRON- do_not want to leave ever
-PRON- will be back every_time -PRON- go
-PRON- must_say this be in -PRON- top 5 night of -PRON- life
quite_possibly in the top 2
decent mexican_food
actually not all that exciting
the burrito chicken be a little rough though the other part of the burrito\/meal cheese\/wrap\/guac\/beans\/rice help make up for that
also -PRON- give out chip and salsa at the beginning and a cinnamon chip at the end so that be nice
all in all ok
just -PRON- first_time back to this restaurant in two year
-PRON- be shock at the difference in service and food
the fish be burn to a crisp the chicken be super dry
even the service at slack off terribly
look_like -PRON- need to find a restaurant
the sunday_brunch be delicious
-PRON- can order as much as -PRON- want of tapa style plate
the quality of the food be high
unfortunately the service be severely lacking
-PRON- wait quite a while for every round of food and even for beverage get food before drink
-PRON- be serve food -PRON- have not order sometimes do_not get food -PRON- do order
-PRON- start bring dessert -PRON- have not order when -PRON- be still wait on more entree then when -PRON- order churro for dessert -PRON- never get -PRON-
if the service could parallel the food -PRON- would be epic but the poor service very much hurt the experience

the staff provide a high chair a tiiiiiny milk bottle and paper straw and overall treat -PRON- little man like a king
and -PRON- love the food
but meanwhile -PRON- be on edge make_sure -PRON- do_not grab anything unsafe or eat the salt right out of the salt shaker because apparently -PRON- kid love salt

-PRON- be very_pleased_with the blueberry pancake that -PRON- have order
talk_about a forkful of antioxidant with each bite
-PRON- friend that -PRON- come in with be not too happy about the pineapple upside pancake that -PRON- choose due_to the batter not be cook all the way_through

-PRON- could of add more stuff in the small taco that be give
and -PRON- love when -PRON- food be hot and the food be warm
the rice be hot though
anywaysss
-PRON- be not really satisfied
try braddock 's for a second_time this time for dinner
overall food be ok fairly unspectacular especially consider the $_80 bill for 2
plan on order the trenne carbanera list on -PRON- website but -PRON- be mysteriously absent from the menu upon arrive
price and description be slightly off on several instance as_well
decide to go with the amish chicken and -PRON- date have the steak frites
as mention early food be not bad by any mean -PRON- have just have substantially good for far less a price_tag
as_far as description go the chicken come with polenta asparagus onion as in nothing like what be describe on -PRON- website
-PRON- be correct on the menu in the restaurant however
so -PRON- do know_what -PRON- be order at the time
dessert be home make smore which be not even list on the web dessert menu
again just kinda meh
for $_8 not exactly a splitable dessert portion wise either
-PRON- definitely leave more satisfied from lunch and at a much small price_tag and therefore will probably just stick to visit for lunch every now and then or possibly order from the pub menu for dinner and not much else look appetizing there
the pittsburgh rueben seem to be the only save grace
here be the thing
many hotel on or near the strip have a theme
treasure island have pirate
the luxor which be giant pyramid have egyptians
excalibur have knight
circus circus have er a circus
the hilton from the outside be just a giant beautiful resort
no theme
so when -PRON- go to the bar and call the bartender -PRON- be a little supris when a fucking klingon come over and yell
at me in klingon
seriously hilton people
-PRON- have to give a little head up to people about the star trek theme
when a borg tap -PRON- on the shoulder if -PRON- be old or just a pussy like some people -PRON- be possible to have a heart attack
the sports book have no alien in -PRON- however and be the good place ever to watch a sox game
the have hundred of giant tv_'s everywhere
-PRON- be awesome
huge pool
no skinnydipping
the room be big and comfortable
also guy if -PRON- just ask nicely every morning for some free buffet comp -PRON- may not have to pay to eat
the sunday_brunch be the good
the monorail be right there to get -PRON- up and down the strip so use -PRON-
there be two 4 one coupon everywhere and an all day pass be 9 buck
-PRON- be so cheap -PRON- can bring a ferengi when -PRON- go out
leave the vulcans home though
-PRON- be lame
this taco_bell use to get -PRON- in and out with the quickness
-PRON- have be here 3 time in the last 2_week and -PRON- take 10_15 min to get -PRON- order
the girl say -PRON- do_not have enough ppl but with minimum wage being so high -PRON- think people would be flock to these job
-PRON- be fast to go to another tb than this one
stumble into this gem on a tuesday_night after an_hour of heavy mixed drinking\/lottery playing at nyny
holy_crap -PRON- have dim_sum but even with a heavy buzz there be no way -PRON- cheap behind be go to throw $ 7.95 at a measly six piece_of shiu mai
that be a good ten_minute of play at the penny slot -PRON- friend
-PRON- usually pick at food like an anorexic chipmunk but hot damn
tonight -PRON- single handedly murder a whole plate of pineapple fry_rice as -PRON- bf and cousin watch in amazement
siriachi sauce and about ten water_down amfs will do wonder for stomach expandment
that little switch that trigger -PRON- to stop eat because -PRON- be full
never turn on
-PRON- be two bite from explode like a retarded goldfish
yeah -PRON- can get just as tasty chinese_food in la for a fraction of the price but for the location and the portion -PRON- would most definitely stop_by again if -PRON- be stay_at the nyny
word
non traditional but still delicious noodle_dish with top_notch service
the prix_fixe lunch be an_amazing deal for such quality ingredient
+ pork and shrimp fried wontons be fry so crisply -PRON- shatter in -PRON- mouth
the juicy filling be the perfect texture with the delicate skin
-PRON- do_not_care for the dipping_sauce and the wonton do_not need any additional flavor
+ ku monk noodles be almost vegetarian with assorted asian veggie float in a vegetable broth next to a poached egg
the broth turn a wonderful creamy color and texture when the egg be pop expose the dark yellow almost orange yolk
-PRON- do_not miss animal protein at all
+ the good service -PRON- have have in any of the restaurant at the sls hotel
jenna be friendly knowledgeable_about the menu and proactive in time the next course
-PRON- service be head and shoulder above anywhere_else at the sls include the fancy pant restaurant katsuya and cleo
ok -PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- husband and -PRON- go on an off night or if -PRON- waiter be the one that just didn;t make this a 5_star experience for -PRON-
not_sure
-PRON- get there and just love the lady that greet -PRON- owner
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- table be not quite ready but_hey that_s ok
-PRON- be ready for a drink at the bar and -PRON- be look pretty_good
so -PRON- think -PRON- would be the vamp at the bar that night
what a cute restaurant
the bartender be awesome and have a shot of limoncello with -PRON-
-PRON- love -PRON- immediately
-PRON- sit_down and -PRON- waiter come over
an_old dude that be very sweet
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- special
-PRON- split the beef carpaccio and -PRON- be very good a little low on salt but very yummy
-PRON- have the scampi special and -PRON- hubby have the wild_boar tagliatelli
yummy but miss something
-PRON- scampi be really not as flavorful as -PRON- would have like but -PRON- be good
-PRON- can tell the pasta be fresh
and -PRON- just love that
-PRON- waiter leave -PRON- alone for a long_time and do_not check back as often as -PRON- would have like
at the end -PRON- only bring the dessert tray and do_not tell -PRON- about all the other ice_cream flavor -PRON- have
-PRON- have to tell -PRON- because -PRON- hear -PRON- from all the other waiter when -PRON- tell -PRON- table
now wassup with that
also -PRON- be tell by the bartender that -PRON- get a complimentary shot of limoncello at the end of -PRON- meal
never happen
all the other table do get one though
so -PRON- think -PRON- be just -PRON- guy
there will be a second_visit and -PRON- will make_sure -PRON- get a different waiter
-PRON- really want to love_this_place and the first_visit do_not let -PRON- love -PRON-
great place -PRON- 4 year_old son love -PRON-
jake in the bird area be extra helpful and kind
-PRON- even take -PRON- picture for -PRON-
-PRON- will_definitely be back
-PRON- be not super big but -PRON- spend a_few hour here and -PRON- son have a great time be careful not to miss exhibit -PRON- almost leave without notice the hallway to the bird and the playground where the tortoise be
-PRON- have to kill some time around 8 on an thursday and stop_by sporting life
yes -PRON- be high_end
and yes parking can be crazy if -PRON- go anywhere good parking be not a cinch
but there be designer deal to be have
and as -PRON- have be know for since -PRON- parent shop with -PRON- there in the 80_'s friendly helpful staff young and old alike and all smile
this be a classic toronto landmark
and -PRON- get something for -PRON- both kid and -PRON- beautiful wife
but -PRON- be not cheap
-PRON- have go here a_few time because the location be convenient but -PRON- be really average
-PRON- be untidy not full fledge dirty and the food be only ok
-PRON- have have the eggs\/bacon or peameal\/ w\/ toast\/potatoe
-PRON- be somewhat bland
but -PRON- give -PRON- a lot_of food
the price be alright for the amount_of food
again -PRON- mainly go because -PRON- be close to -PRON- condo
and -PRON- do_not have to pay for parking
-PRON- use to come_here a few_year_ago when -PRON- be brian 's beach
when -PRON- hear -PRON- close down -PRON- be sad and find -PRON- lose and confused
then -PRON- see that this joint open and take over
-PRON- be very skeptical at first to try this_place but -PRON- be glad -PRON- do
if -PRON- like brian 's beach -PRON- believe -PRON- keep the same menu
-PRON- bf and -PRON- be now frequent visitor of this_place
-PRON- have stamp card which entice -PRON- to come_back because once -PRON- get 10 stamp -PRON- will win a grand prize of eat one free ayce meal
-PRON- try pretty_much everything on the menu and have not be disapoint
also if -PRON- do_not want to order a whole roll and want to attempt to try everything on the menu ask -PRON- to do half roll

-PRON- host a 25 person surprise party at 5th and wine in december and the staff be amazing
-PRON- would be try to plan this event for some time and most bars\/restaurant be not willing_to accommodate a large party without a set menu or minimum spend
5th and wine be more then happy to host -PRON-
-PRON- set -PRON- up in the back dining_room which be the perfect spot
when -PRON- friend be arrive -PRON- go around and close all the curtain so -PRON- would not see in
-PRON- waitstaff be on_top_of -PRON-

-PRON- be extremely diligent and go_above and beyond to help -PRON-
-PRON- will_definitely be call anytime plumbing and ask for j.d. the next_time -PRON- have an_issue
-PRON- be a big_fan_of hot and sour_soup and a_bit of a snob about -PRON- since -PRON- have eat so_much of -PRON-
at first -PRON- do_not think -PRON- would like the soup when -PRON- come_out because -PRON- tend_to like broth that be dark and rich looking and this broth seem a little light for -PRON- taste -PRON- want a hybrid broth + sauce but -PRON- be delicious
flavorful and chock full of good thing -PRON- be definitely a fan
-PRON- also get some fry dumpling that be pretty_good although there be a place in huntington beach that make -PRON- just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
and -PRON- have yet to find a good replacement and -PRON- brother get a beef dish that -PRON- really_enjoy
all in all -PRON- be a good experience very authentic and the people be nice albeit not_overly friendly
this evening -PRON- witness the bad possible thing a parent that have a child in daycare could ever see
a teacher abuse a child
when -PRON- go to pick_up -PRON- daughter today -PRON- be in a highchair feed -PRON- a bottle
there be another child sit next to -PRON- in a highchair and a third child cry on the ground on a play mat
-PRON- pick_up -PRON- daughter out of the highchair and gather -PRON- thing
-PRON- make small talk with the teacher for a few_minute and tell -PRON- to have a nice afternoon
-PRON- respond with oh -PRON- will as_soon_as -PRON- get -PRON- the child on the ground to stop cry
-PRON- then place -PRON- in the highchair -PRON- daughter be in and give -PRON- a_few toy
as -PRON- be leave with -PRON- daughter -PRON- turn back around in the doorway and witness the teacher violently shake the child in a highchair
with like everything -PRON- have in -PRON-
-PRON- shake the shit out of that child a good 7 10 time
-PRON- notice -PRON- look in the door and slow down to make -PRON- appear like -PRON- be rock -PRON-
-PRON- could feel -PRON- eye immediately fill with tear
-PRON- take off with -PRON- daughter and call -PRON- husband right_away to tell -PRON- what_happen
-PRON- then call and report the teacher to the school director
-PRON- be tell -PRON- would report the teacher and follow the correct process to inform corporate
which would involve write documentation and lead to possible termination
not good enough in -PRON- book
-PRON- have pull -PRON- daughter out of this daycare and be get a refund for the week
-PRON- also request that the parent of the child be inform
the director say -PRON- would but who know
unfortunately this daycare do_not have camera
so -PRON- do_not_know_how serious -PRON- will take -PRON- claim
all -PRON- know be there be no way -PRON- daughter will ever be go_back to this daycare
-PRON- be so upset and terrify to think if anything have happen to -PRON- daughter or any of the other child that have go unnoticed
thank_god
-PRON- see what -PRON- do today and be able_to get -PRON- out before any more possible abuse occur
-PRON- be still in shock
-PRON- hope this never happen to anyone_else
-PRON- would give zero or negative start if possible
-PRON- understand one bad apple do_not mean the entire orchard be contaminate
but -PRON- be important that a daycare foster a positive work environment for -PRON- teacher and have policy in place to ensure this type_of thing never happen
not only be the teacher at fault for -PRON- action but so be the director and corporate
favorite weekly restaurant for -PRON- family
as a arizona native -PRON- can say that this be great everyday mexican_food and -PRON- never_disappoint
if barrio be to chipotle and momocho be to qdoba then nuevo be to moe 's
as such the food be poor yet more expensive than -PRON- competitor
or bad the quesadilla remind -PRON- of taco_bell 's crunchwrap supreme that -PRON- have have in the past which be not the ratatouille like nostalgic experience -PRON- be look for
the open_kitchen in front of the table kind_of bring about a fast_food vibe in -PRON-
moreover -PRON- be a_bit loud and hectic inside
the taco with the pineapple slaw be slightly good but el pollo be not anything special
furthermore the black_bean and rice especially be cold
otherwise the waiter be friendly
although the germaphobe inside -PRON- screech as -PRON- grab -PRON- water cup by the rim of the glass and do_not provide straw unless one ask for the unwrapped straw that -PRON- be nice_touch and put inside the drink -PRON-
nonetheless -PRON- be certainly a good spot for drink and some beach volleyball on the pier
there be plenty_of table out front along_with a second_floor patio where one can take in a stunning view of downtown cleveland
additionally the impressive design of the building pull one in to make a stop
pitiful
-PRON- work in the restaurant industry
-PRON- would give no star if -PRON- could
the manager present be a joke
first of all -PRON- walk_in and there be 2 bag of lettuce lay on the table next to the soda machine
sound appetizing right
completely unfriendly staff text on -PRON- phone at the register in front of the manager
trash everywhere -PRON- would not lick the floor for a million dollar
not only do -PRON- incorrectly make -PRON- sandwich but -PRON- also make the sub on the stainless steel counter with nothing underneath
judge by the cleanliness and standard of this_place -PRON- will_never go_back
lastly after observe the staff and management 20_minute_later the lettuce remain on the table
the chip display be sparse
the manager walk by several_time and do_not even think to put -PRON- away and out of sight of customer
-PRON- be small talk the employee about a party stand there all of -PRON- do nothing
sweep the floor
restock the chip
wipe_down the counter
refill the soda area
this_place be mediocre at best
wow
excellent food
green chile be the good
-PRON- always order extra chip and salsa because -PRON- be so addictive
if -PRON- like new mexican in the style of los dos malinos -PRON- will love_this_place
-PRON- get one of the bad haircut in recent memory at this_place which i find strange see as -PRON- be the most_expensive haircut -PRON- have ever have
there be a huge long chunk of hair at the back which -PRON- wife have to cut off
go to either proper stylist or a cheap barber
this_place be the bad of both world
-PRON- should mention that the guy_who cut -PRON- hair be young and inexperienced and he tell -PRON- as much
not what i expect from a fancy haircut
fun drinking game take a shot every_time a yelper playfully incorporate me gusta tacos in -PRON- review
anywhoo ~ let -PRON- be know that the day -PRON- visit -PRON- gusta tacos be the day -PRON- borderline overdose on -PRON- delicous churro

-PRON- be a step above -PRON- normal taco budget
but -PRON- be pay for quality bruh
oh and free chips
raid -PRON- salsa fridge to douse -PRON- chip and -PRON- will be a happy camper
fish_taco 5\/5
-PRON- be not a big_fan_of wasabi but -PRON- wasabi crema that lubricate the fish marry the cabbage and cilantro nicely
the fish be flaky and delicious
note that -PRON- be grill not batter and deep_fry like most typical fish_taco good move for the health conscious
handmade corn_tortilla
make all the difference
mission burrito $ 8)- 4.5\/5 rice pico guac cheese and -PRON- choice of meat
i get the kalbi
love how -PRON- toast -PRON- burrito
so there be a subtle crunch
check_out -PRON- pic superb meat to rice ratio
-PRON- only_complaint be that -PRON- feel_like the kalbi asian flavor be lose with the other component on the burrito i wish -PRON- have a more asian flavor center burrito that incorporate kimchi and\/or -PRON- asian slaw to complement the kalbi
still a delicious burrito tho can_not deny that
watermelon mint agua fresca $_3.50
5\/5 sublime when -PRON- overdose on -PRON- habanero salsa

10\/10 would sip in_vegas heat
no artificial flavoring here this be the real deal
bonus_point
-PRON- serve local vegas brew beer
whaat

the coffee be extremely mild but tolerable enough to drink
-PRON- waitress be absolutely lovely and the place be invite and comfortable
-PRON- taste irn bru for the first_time
unfortunately -PRON- taste_like carbonate cane syrup and have a bright orange radioactive orange colouring
just plain fantastic
about 70 of the menu be not -PRON- typical mexican fare
excellent seafood option
try the shrimp pepper and wrap in bacon
-PRON- be pretty darned good but will try other item when -PRON- come_back because there be literally 12 + must_try dish in -PRON- menu
the michalade spelling drink with tomato_sauce and beer be super fantastic
way good_than a bloody_mary
and -PRON- love bloody_mary 's

worth the drive out to phoenix
awesome museum -PRON- kid love -PRON- and so do -PRON- dad
-PRON- have everything from pan for gold rock and mineral dinosaur native american history to space even an_old jail
not_sure_why other_review say there be not enough sensory and hand on activity every area have something for the kid to draw put the puzzle together etc
-PRON- be very in expensive for an educational day
deff recommend -PRON-
2_star for great pasta
utterly atrocious service
slow inattentive and disengage at different time
-PRON- be busy so -PRON- would have tolerate slow service but toss the food and drink on the table forget drink and utensil and not bring thing when ask be unforgivable
mushy look avocado on_top_of salad but rest be ok
would not return

-PRON- change -PRON- loyalty program when -PRON- be two taco away_from a free one

today i want to try_something_different
so -PRON- order the chili chicken
this dish be gooooood
if -PRON- like spicy then -PRON- will love this
-PRON- be a_bit spicy than -PRON- be use to but the pita bread help with that
lol
-PRON- be a big portion too so -PRON- have to ask for a to go box for -PRON- leftover

-PRON- only disappointment be that -PRON- can_not give -PRON- rave_review that be original everything have already be say
what a great place the staff be friendly the food delicious and the atmosphere fun
the lamb taco be sublime
this be a neighborhood gem
-PRON- see a big ad in the paper for schmitt jewelers this weekend and -PRON- wonder how -PRON- can afford such a big ad after in essence send -PRON- away with nothing but disgust and -PRON- ring -PRON- want to reset
-PRON- be service by a man who identify -PRON- as michael schmitt who be so uninterested in find a solution for -PRON- that -PRON- be stunned when -PRON- leave
as a sale_person and apparently part of this family business -PRON- would think -PRON- would want a new customer but -PRON- have never be make to feel so unimportant in -PRON- life after spend maybe 15_minute with this guy
-PRON- just feel -PRON- want to be do something_else than try to help -PRON- find a solution to -PRON- reset
aloofness strange feeling of completely uninterested
this be the good food -PRON- have ever have at an airport
-PRON- order a basil chicken baguette
the baguette be very warm soft and the chicken be very_tasty
katlin -PRON- server be friendly and professional
-PRON- know where -PRON- will dine from now on at the phx

-PRON- want to just get a plain carne_asada burrito with rice but the employee advise that -PRON- should get the california burrito with carne_asada and boy be that a great recommendation
the burrito be so good and have so_much flavor kinda remind -PRON- of a burrito back home los angeles
-PRON- will_definitely be go_back real soon
i do_not get -PRON- nail do too often but when i do this be -PRON- go to spot
-PRON- be quick easy clean and i love that -PRON- do_not talk too_much
maybe that be just -PRON- but -PRON- be not a huge_fan_of make small talk for an_hour every two week
-PRON- nail always turn_out perfect and look great for week
if -PRON- be look for a new nail spot in the arcadia area check_out ken 's
-PRON- will not be disappoint
excellent food and atmosphere
love the light food especially the hummus nachos
-PRON- would_highly_recommend
-PRON- server tyler be amazing and take great care of -PRON-
-PRON- will be back
maybe even tomorrow
-PRON- stop in one evening recently
-PRON- son and -PRON- share a 4 meat plate and -PRON- wife have the 2 meat plate
the food be good but -PRON- be over price
-PRON- check be $ 64 plus tip
-PRON- price need to come down to be more competitive with other bbq around nc
-PRON- server be great
go with the boyfriend to update -PRON- phone
the employee be eager to help
-PRON- talk to quite a_few and end_up purchase -PRON- phone with jesse
-PRON- be fun nice and work quickly to get -PRON- on -PRON- way
keith be the guy that help -PRON- set_up -PRON- new phone with the old stuff
and -PRON- help keep -PRON- occupy while the phone be work to update -PRON-
very_personable and know -PRON- apple product
-PRON- know a lot_of people talk_about the wait in this store but -PRON- be pretty_much in and out of there
guess -PRON- pay to go on a thursday afternoon
lol
terrible terrible terrible
-PRON- send out people_who do_not fix internet problem
-PRON- have sign_up for -PRON- service a week_ago and still have not get any service
highly_recommend
-PRON- book this car with hesitation as -PRON- be shock with the weekly rate of $ 78
during ces after tax -PRON- come_out to $ 119
as -PRON- arrive check in be smooth
ali be a pro get -PRON- through the check in process and do_not hassle -PRON- when -PRON- say no insurance or prepay gas
go down stair and get -PRON- car
-PRON- ask for a compact but -PRON- give -PRON- a brand_new impala
that be the only disappointing thing_about the rental as this car be a gas guzzler
the good news this car be brand_new with only 49 mile on -PRON-
make_sure -PRON- thoroughly check the body of the car
so -PRON- do_not get charge for damage
upon return -PRON- be easy price be the same as quote and receipt email to -PRON- digitally sign on ipad
-PRON- could_not ask for a good experience
the other thing -PRON- wish -PRON- would of do be explain_how to leave the rental garage the exit be not man and -PRON- have to scan a barcode on -PRON- document folder
other_than_that -PRON- be super pleased_with -PRON- rental and would definitely rent with ez again
do_not let the other_review sway -PRON-
-PRON- maybe rent a car once a year and this experience be awesome
this be a decent buffet at a good buffet 's price but selection be fairly moderate here
for breakfast the usual hot tray laden with roll blini and pancake and muffin and plenty_of meat etc
etc be all here
-PRON- all seem pretty rotate and fresh so no_problem there
nothing really stand out except selection be a_bit light
the line be also small than at some -PRON- have be to but there be really nothing_special at all about this buffet compare to other place
if -PRON- be in the mood for a buffet and close at hand this would be fine but nothing to go out of -PRON- way for
this be another like all buffet in_vegas that -PRON- will be most_likely to stand in line to wait for debatably worth -PRON-
stop_by here with a couple friend while -PRON- be visit from out of town
-PRON- really like the ambiance of the place kind_of a hipster vibe
the hush puppy be a very good appetizer -PRON- would_recommend
however -PRON- waiter overhyp the rest_of the food a_bit unfortunately say -PRON- be without a doubt the good mac and cheese and fry_chicken in_charlotte
the fry_chicken and mac and cheese be just okay"
definitely not the good -PRON- have ever have
chicken be nice and crispy but do_not have much flavor for some_reason
-PRON- have a good assortment_of mixed drink and a stocked bar
-PRON- will try this_place again next_time -PRON- be in_town to see what the rest_of the menu be like
i have not be to sc in about 3_year or so and know_how restaurant be in_toronto
-PRON- would imagine in the year since -PRON- have either get too pretentious\/expensive for -PRON- be own good or be buy by someone that just do_not_care as much
-PRON- be happy to report neither of the above be true
have an_incredible meal great service and no hipster douche baginess
-PRON- really be a great experience
-PRON- have tone down over the year
-PRON- use to be like a microcosm of mardi gras no_longer
to be honest -PRON- always find that a_bit disparage and well try a_bit too hard on -PRON- part in the part to be a_bit of a theme park of a dinner experience
the whole_experience have mature quite a_bit no drag queen hostess anymore sadly and -PRON- do_not feel_like the circus -PRON- use to be
-PRON- be grow_up a_bit
but -PRON- be not dull
nice balance after 20_year
not the good banh mi
-PRON- have ever have but the sushi here be to die for
this small sandwich place be locate_in a sketchy area of hochelaga maisonneuve and be one of the clean more modern viet resto
-PRON- have a good variety_of banh mi
but -PRON- find that there could have be more pate and more mayo
feel_like the banh mi be lack
the sushi be surprisingly fresh and tasty
-PRON- have lunch combo as_well
all in all a good choice to grab a quick_bite in the area
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- birthday dinner here every year and can_not speak highly_enough about the quality of the food
this year however -PRON- have a bad_experience with -PRON- waitress\/server where -PRON- feel that -PRON- be an inconvenience to -PRON-
what be the point of enjoy a great family dinner if -PRON- feel awkward to ask for -PRON- food or drink
-PRON- really hope to change -PRON- review next_year when -PRON- come_back or -PRON- will have to change -PRON- venue for stone crab
-PRON- be often ask by friend and fellow_yelper what be a place -PRON- should try
or what be -PRON- favorite restaurant
the answer -PRON- always unflinchingly give be soul gastrolounge
with that here be everything -PRON- need to know soul 1
loong wait
the wait to get a table can be long
very long
-PRON- mean -PRON- pretty simple do_not go to soul on thursday or friday_night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs
therefore -PRON- only go to soul on tuesdays or wednesday
oh and -PRON- do_not_accept reservation
2
no lunch
that be right
soul do_not open until 5_p.m.
-PRON- usually try to get there a little later in the evening usually after the main dinner rush around 9_p.m. or so
3
dj tunes
-PRON- be not 100 sure but -PRON- believe -PRON- have a dj on hand thursday saturday_night start around 9_p.m.
the dj 's be always on point with the music and really add to soul 's trendy vibe and reputation -PRON- have around charlotte
4
no parking
there be no parking_lot or area exclusively for soul 's patron
-PRON- good bet be to park in the lot across the street near cvs sometimes -PRON- $_5 or anywhere_else around the heart of plaza midwood near thomas street tavern\/whiskey warehouse and walk over
5
the food be amazing
although -PRON- have try many item on the menu from the pork_belly slider to the steak and egg which both make -PRON- mouth water -PRON- favorite item be the sakana roll
-PRON- a tuna salmon avocado sushi_roll lightly fry simply the good sushi in_charlotte
if sushi be not -PRON- thing do_not worry there be plenty_of great menu_item as -PRON- say the steak and egg or any of the skewer be great
the humus of the day and guac stack be both great tasting light option
the french_fry w\/truffle oil be out of this_world yummy
6
hip

vibe
-PRON- like soul 's ambiance so_much because -PRON- the perfect representation of the people and culture of plaza midwood and charlotte as a whole
-PRON- young hip chill and different

-PRON- have be wait patiently to try this ice_cream experience since -PRON- be open on bloor
today be the day
and wow this be everything -PRON- hop for and more
there be a menu of quite a_few different option to go with
what -PRON- need to know be the cone the ice_cream be put in be a donut cover in either glaze or cinnamon or a different topping
then there be a chocolate truffle at the bottom
then soft_serve ice_cream with topping then more ice_cream
-PRON- be quite a masterpiece
the staff be super_friendly and helpful
since -PRON- be -PRON- first_time -PRON- be open to suggestion and -PRON- be able_to_help
-PRON- order and -PRON- ice_cream be ready in just a minute

-PRON- sister have the ahi_tuna lunch portion with sweet_potato_fry and say -PRON- be exceptional
-PRON- have the buttermilk fried_chicken unwrapped think chicken wrap but not fold
yummy
-PRON- server erika be friendly knowledgeable and the food turn amazingly well for a very_reasonable_price
-PRON- can see why yelp reviewer rank this highly 4 in chandler
-PRON- will_definitely be back
customer_service be awesome
-PRON- mess_up -PRON- order and when -PRON- call to fix -PRON- -PRON- have already recognize the issue and resolve -PRON- perfectly
the website be a_bit tricky to maneuver on -PRON- iphone so that be where the mix up occur
-PRON- have not hear if the cookiegram be deliver to -PRON- recipient yet
so -PRON- can only comment_on the service at the moment
but so_far so good

-PRON- say 3 out of 10 and -PRON- be perfect
amazing flavour
not too_much heat
nice lady
oh -PRON-
god
where do -PRON- start
-PRON- be a 20-year customer minus a break where -PRON- get so feed up with -PRON- poor_customer_service and high price that -PRON- allow -PRON- to get sucker into century link who be even bad
-PRON- switch back and soon find -PRON- cable bill above $_250 so -PRON- switch to the basic internet and tv and turn in -PRON- telephone modem and dvr box
this be where the current fiasco start
when -PRON- go to the cox store -PRON- tell the guy -PRON- want to purchase a modem
and -PRON- get -PRON- one
several month later -PRON- notice -PRON- be still bill -PRON- for phone service which -PRON- cancel and turned in the modem for on the same visit to the cox store and modem rental
-PRON- call the cox to get the phone service refund and the modem switch to purchase vice rental and be transfer 3 time and hang_up_on twice
once when wait to be escalate to a customer retention supervisor over the poor_customer_service ironic repeat turf -PRON- to other department before -PRON- can even speak the word
wait don't transfer -PRON-
the total time -PRON- take to get a customer retention supervisor on the line be 66 minute 2 disconnect and three transfer and even then -PRON- state that -PRON- would have to bring -PRON- modem back because -PRON- be a rental
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do_not want to have to restore -PRON- network as -PRON- have numerous security camera that take hours to reprogram and -PRON- state well -PRON- do_not sell modem out of the cox store those be rental only
that be absolutely wrong
and -PRON- ask -PRON- to investigate and call -PRON- back
-PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- would call back the next_day and never do
-PRON- get an email state that -PRON- have purchase a modem that night
-PRON- business process be break -PRON- customer_service representative be undertrained apathetic and the only common strength -PRON- could find across the numerous transfer to other department be that everyone excel at deliver the standard scripted apology that read like this
-PRON- be so sorry -PRON- state customer problem
-PRON- will do -PRON- good to resolve restate customer problem
turf caller to another department
-PRON- wish someone along that 66-minute painful phone_call would have actually stop apologize long enough to show some ownership and resolve my issue
-PRON- wish -PRON- business process be sustainable enough that when -PRON- go in to a cox store and change -PRON- service and watch the guy enter the order -PRON- actually get carry out rather_than ignore require further visit call and exasperation
-PRON- wish that -PRON- new purchase router do_not actually slow down -PRON- internet and reboot itself numerous_time per day but at this point -PRON- just do_not have the heart to call for technical support or service because well -PRON- be cox and the stress would probably kill -PRON-
-PRON- have disappoint -PRON- for nearly 20_year
-PRON- be not improve and -PRON- wish there be a good solution for high speed internet in the phoenix_area
so -PRON- could flee -PRON- service
-PRON- once have long strong healthy blond hair -PRON- now have mushy stretchy blue highlight
george be -PRON- name
stay_away
the club -PRON- be awesome
amenity galore and serene
beware of front_desk worker lynn m.
-PRON- be rude abrasive and inconsiderate
-PRON- people skill deserve zero_star however the club -PRON- be awesome
-PRON- have a groupon deal unfortunately -PRON- will not alloy -PRON- to sit on the same table if -PRON- want to redeem more_than 1 groupon
food be good but not extraordinary regular casual sea food place with reasonable_price
so so not as nice and nowhere near as friendly as the comfort inn dorval
-PRON- would stay there instead if possible
front_desk_staff here be not very_friendly when -PRON- check in
the location be also a_bit far_from the airport to be consider an airport hotel in -PRON- opinion
supposedly -PRON- have an airport shuttle but -PRON- have no luck get -PRON- after an_hour of wait and try to call -PRON- from the airport
cab here cost almost $_30 cad include tip
pretty clean fairly comfortable bed
would not stay_here_again
-PRON- have find -PRON- holy grail
finally a hair_salon that care_about the health of -PRON- hair
-PRON- go for a wash cut and style and -PRON- experience be amazing

-PRON- will_definitely recommend_this_place to -PRON- friend
and -PRON- will_definitely go again
this girl know -PRON- stuff
this be by_far the bad company -PRON- can ever work for
-PRON- be so degenerate when -PRON- come down to -PRON- employee
-PRON- literally treat -PRON- bad than trash
especially the supervisor by the name of israel bad human be -PRON- can ever meet
people really need to boycott this_company
good gyro -PRON- have ever have
the meat be tender flavorful and a generous_portion
the tzatziki sauce be delicious
not runny like most place
the price be good too
under_$ 9 for a gyro fry and drink
not bad for a fresh hot meal
-PRON- only interact with the cashier
-PRON- be pleasant
there be a full view of the kitchen an -PRON- seem everyone be work well together
-PRON- love watch the meat carver be the carnivore -PRON- be
-PRON- will be back to taste more of the menu selection
so_much to_choose_from
when -PRON- go to lappert 's ice_cream shop what do -PRON- do
of_course -PRON- get ice_cream
but a big dummy like -PRON- -PRON- come_here to get a cup of coffee
if be a very hot afternoon 102 degree and -PRON- do_not feel_like walk to the golden nugget hotel for starbucks or to the fremont hotel for dunkin donuts coffee so -PRON- go upstairs to the mezzanine level of the california hotel stop_by lappert 's ice_cream shop for coffee
besides ice_cream -PRON- serve coffee here as_well_as winchell 's donut
-PRON- have never have a winchell 's donut but -PRON- see winchell be all over the place in southern california
upon walk_into the shop -PRON- decide to get a cup of coffee but lucky for -PRON-
-PRON- have this deal where -PRON- buy a 16 oz
cup of -PRON- gourmet coffee
-PRON- get a free winchell 's donut wot a deal
well after get -PRON- cup of coffee -PRON- realize the coffee really be not too gourmet
in_fact the coffee taste a little burn to -PRON- as -PRON- think the coffee be on the heating pot for too_long of a period to top if off the free glaze donut -PRON- get be hard too
yuck
-PRON- guess -PRON- probably have the winchell 's donuts\/pastrie ship in so who know_how long -PRON- sit before -PRON- get serve
-PRON- would probably be good if -PRON- get the donut from a winchell 's shop instead
if -PRON- come_back here again
i'd probably skip out on the coffee donut and stick with the ice_cream
have -PRON- daily soup that be chicken
-PRON- be ok but portion be small for 4.50
also have shrimp roti
a new menu_item be so salty could_not finish -PRON-
what a waste
absolutely_love the food here but -PRON- literally take_forever to receive
this be the second_time -PRON- have sit in the drive_through for 15 + minute
really suck
-PRON- love oreganos be usual location be on bell rd but -PRON- move to tolleson and have_no_idea of this_location until -PRON- google -PRON-
-PRON- go on a saturday evening

-PRON- wait be long about 45_min and honestly -PRON- never wait that long anywhere
but -PRON- do hop that -PRON- would go faster which -PRON- do_not
but -PRON- be ok
-PRON- finally get a table and -PRON- waiter be

nice accommodation
friendly helpful staff
bed too firm for -PRON- liking
wake_up stiff and achy

jack astor 's be very fun -PRON- be at a great location at the corner of yonge and dundas and look into dundas square however -PRON- have to sit inside because all the balcony seating be always take and always have a long waitlist

very_friendly though
take quite a while to get drink but the bar be very busy
as the night go on the music get louder so do_not come_here if -PRON- want to carry on a conversation
on one visit to noori -PRON- notice a person use a hair dryer to peel off the reconditioned label of merchandise
virtually everything in that store that be electrical or electronic have be recondition by the manufacturer and noori do_not want -PRON- to know that fact
-PRON- find no reason to go there at all
and -PRON- do_not recommend -PRON-
give half a chance -PRON- would give this_place no star at all
this starbuck be incredible
-PRON- most favorite part

happy holly days
the new kid in_town be do okay
like everyone_else -PRON- seem -PRON- pick_up a groupon for breakfast here
-PRON- be a teenie tiny little place the kind_of place where -PRON- think -PRON- will know many of -PRON- customer by name
the menu be not extensive that be -PRON- only_reason for 4_star -PRON- want more choice
but what be there be solid and good
hub and -PRON- come alone one more and have breakfast platter then bring -PRON- monthly breakfast group a few_week later
the breakfast platter be a solid 2 egg meal make special because -PRON- be -PRON- homemade bread that be toast
that make -PRON- a worthwhile trip by -PRON-
there be something about a thick slab of crack wheat bread toast to perfection crunchy outside but nice chewy center- that make -PRON- heart sing
and the fact_that -PRON- can make a sunny side up egg without screw -PRON- up
and -PRON- actually know_what -PRON- want when -PRON- say bacon crispy
-PRON- have yet to figure_out why any restaurant have trouble with those two request but alas -PRON- do

-PRON- be really excited from all the yelp_review and the atmosphere after -PRON- walk_into this restaurant
but this be honestly the most disappointed and lead astray that -PRON- have be in a long_time
the restaurant have a really great environment with colombian esque relic and trinket adorn the wall fun painting on the wall and ton_of graffiti leave by adore guest
-PRON- be a really_cool atmosphere
however the service be pretty bad
-PRON- be not all that busy and the waiter be no where to be find most of the time
the food also take a really long_time to come_out
-PRON- order a beef arepa with a side of chip and could_not have be more disappointed
-PRON- be boring and pretty_much tasteless
-PRON- need sauce which be no where in sight
and -PRON- side of stale tortilla chip come with no salsa or anything
when -PRON- ask the waiter what the other side be -PRON- be so unhelpful
-PRON- get annoy and simply order chip
who serve chip without anything to dip -PRON- in
huge_disappointment
-PRON- have windows instal that leak
cause damage to -PRON- house
have to take -PRON- to small claim court to get $ 800 judgement

-PRON- husband 's drink be still empty after 40 plus minute

-PRON- dad enjoy -PRON- taco but the pull_pork chili be just pull_pork and bean no juice or stew at all
-PRON- waitress pass_by 7 10 time and have not acknowledge -PRON- empty drink cup at all
so ridiculous
do_not come_here if -PRON- want good service and good food
-PRON- father and -PRON- have be here multiple_time over the week
and -PRON- have the same service each_time
-PRON- ask another waitress for help and -PRON- just blow -PRON- off
f*ck this_place
will_never come_back
great customer_service repair in a timely_manner
a_bit expensive but -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
favorite delivery could look_at the special instruction i.e extra sauce extra crispy
also delivery charge be shenanigan
then -PRON- expect a tip when -PRON- forget
great food just focus
especially after an_hour delivery
-PRON- love hug n pup

since -PRON- group consist_of 16 people the restaurant request in_advance that -PRON- do a prix_fixe menu
that be fine with -PRON-
the menu choice be alright but -PRON- be certainly not blow_away_by the option
-PRON- option for app be a poach pear salad charcuterie all pate or tiny white fish
-PRON- choose the fish not realize that -PRON- be many individual whole fish deep_fry in batter
while delicious -PRON- be a_bit put off once -PRON- learn exactly_what -PRON- be eat
-PRON- option for main be scallop steak frite or duck
almost everyone choose the steak frite
while enjoyable -PRON- be nothing to write_home_about
other in -PRON- group be far more impressed than -PRON- be
dessert be impressive
-PRON- bring -PRON- all empty dessert plate and -PRON- occur to -PRON- that -PRON- be go to be family style dessert
-PRON- immediately worry that there would not be enough to go around
but -PRON- then begin to bring_out plate after plate of warm fresh baked cookie delicious
and just when -PRON- think that be enough to go around -PRON- also bring_out fresh warm doughnut timbit shaped
dessert win -PRON- over
service be decent although the waitress confuse the bill and tell -PRON- an incorrect per_person cost which would not have cover the whole bill
luckily -PRON- double_check -PRON- math before too_many people leave and underpayed
-PRON- give -PRON- the back room to -PRON- which work out great although the acoustic be not great and -PRON- seem excessively noisy and difficult to hear each_other
-PRON- understand -PRON- brunch and full menu be beyond impressive
so -PRON- may try this_place again
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- but will not be send everyone there in a rush
still can_not believe how unprofessional this hair stylist be
what a terrible experience today
-PRON- book the appointment online through -PRON- online booking system after which -PRON- confirm the appointment

jennifer
-PRON- do_not_matter how good of a hair stylist -PRON- be which make -PRON- really doubt -PRON- be a good one but -PRON- can_not be so utterly unprofessional rude and inconsiderate of -PRON- customer
at_least -PRON- could have pick_up -PRON- phone and apologize
-PRON- waste 3 hour of -PRON- day because of -PRON-
and base_on previous review this be not the first_time not even the second_time -PRON- happen
but i want to give -PRON- a chance anyway

-PRON- room be dirty
there be dry food on the floor rust in the tub and mold in the bathroom and on the ceiling
-PRON- should have know better on the drive to the hotel all the business have bar on the windows
the first indication that -PRON- would not be pleased be this be the first bbq place -PRON- have ever be to where -PRON- walk_in and -PRON- do_not smell smoke
there be no one else in the place except some of the help that be just sit around
the gentleman that explain the menu to -PRON- let -PRON- know that -PRON- no_longer make the pork loin -PRON- be out of the salmon and 2 of the side
-PRON- order a 3 meat platter with pull_pork rib $_4 upcharge and brisket
-PRON- be tell that the only brisket -PRON- have be shred that -PRON- just break_down

-PRON- be a 2009 sealy pillow top wear down from 8 year of use
food service in room dining be phenomenal -PRON- get breakfast and dinner
shrimp scampi be delicious along_with the lava cake desert
so so for a top tier hotel
if -PRON- be price under 100 $ -PRON- would stay again but not a top choice
these_guy do a decent job
the only_thing be that -PRON- really need a nail_technician that have some artistic flare
when -PRON- ask to get a design which be basically polk dot and an arrow -PRON- keep ask -PRON- why -PRON- want that
think -PRON- be a_bit odd
really that should have be -PRON- hint
arrow do_not look_like arrow at all
-PRON- will try another place

-PRON- do_not make -PRON- to the ces
-PRON- need to watch out how -PRON- handle the food
-PRON- be terrible
great facility beautiful view and surprisingly good food too
-PRON- company host -PRON- annual award ceremony here a few_week_ago and a good time be have by all
nice atmosphere especially outside patio
strange to see some people dress gym casual on a friday_night as_well_as some kid
-PRON- pour chimay into a pilsner glass so bad mark for that
falaffel appetizer be nice but falaffel -PRON- be too finely ground and flavorless
salads be really outstanding
enchiladas also be very good
thai short_rib be pretty_good as_well
great dessert option
overall pricey but fair
bone in parm be incredible
come_back every_time -PRON- go to vegas

.dr

believe -PRON- -PRON- can feel the difference immediately but -PRON- get even good with more time and treatment
there be no painful crunch or adjustment
dr._bonaci know the most efficient path to every pain
this may sound weird but -PRON- be often surprised when -PRON- manipulate area that -PRON- have no clue be associate with the pain that -PRON- be have in a totally different area
-PRON- highly_recommend follow the full personalized regime that -PRON- design just for -PRON- as_well if -PRON- truly want last permanent result
-PRON- will not take long to be a believer as to how dr._bonaci along_with holly really can make a difference

but -PRON- be extremely nice
after a long_wait butter avenue have finally open
now -PRON- can tell -PRON- that -PRON- probably would not have know about this_place if -PRON- have not be for the hotel ocho event last_year
ever since that first_bite of -PRON- macaron -PRON- be hooked
-PRON- immediately start stalk -PRON- on facebook wait -PRON- to open
finally the day come and -PRON- rush to go see -PRON-
now -PRON- may wonder_why -PRON- be make such a big_deal about this_place but -PRON- assure -PRON- that one bite will explain_everything
-PRON- macaron be light soft chewy and fall_apart in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- have have bad one too that be kinda like oreo cookie bah

-PRON- just buy 4 box and have not try every one
but -PRON- can tell -PRON- which one be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- favorite one be the sea_salt caramel and matcha
the sea_salt caramel be just amazing
probably the good balance of flavour and the chewy light texture of the macaron just add to the amazing experience
the matcha tea one apparently have matcha tea from japan which be amazing
-PRON- can instantly taste the matcha tea flavour and -PRON- be awesome
-PRON- also serve coffee tea sandwich and other pastry that apparently go fast
this_place open not too_long ago so the word be go to start spread pretty fast
come early and soon to avoid the wildfire that be start
mum the word
burger be pretty small and the entire thing be lace with grease
the bag be drip wet
flavor be okay nothing mind_blow

then -PRON- wait over 1_hour to get to the actual test
then -PRON- be slide into the machine and panic after 10 second
part of the problem be -PRON- never give -PRON- a panic button
the mirror be angle in a way that -PRON- could only see -PRON- own eye instead_of out the machine

-PRON- tell -PRON- f

however -PRON- would have to have someone come with -PRON-
-PRON- have only one friend in_las_vegas -PRON- be not able_to take off of work just to take -PRON- to a mri
other issue be the next available test date would be over 2_week away

-PRON- say -PRON- be triple booked and -PRON- will have to come another day -PRON- really lack any and all compassion
-PRON- be run like a meat market where -PRON- take a number and -PRON- do_not even care enough to make -PRON- experience pleasant

little do -PRON- know this be go to be a very bad decision
-PRON- call on monday_morning to make_an_appointment

-PRON- timeline be very tight as -PRON- have to go home pick_up -PRON- dog take -PRON- to the vet and then drop -PRON- back and get back to work within an_hour
-PRON- have mention this when -PRON- make the appointment and the receptionist tell -PRON- that -PRON- would get -PRON- see quickly and if there be any issue with timing base_on other appointment -PRON- would give -PRON- a call before -PRON- come in
-PRON- never hear back so -PRON- assume everything be good with timing
when -PRON- get there -PRON- have to wait 15_minute before -PRON- could be see and then another 15_minute when the vet go away to get -PRON- a quote for -PRON- suggested examination -PRON- actually walk_out and then be call back in otherwise the wait would have be longer
-PRON- wait a total of 30_minute and -PRON- total stay there be 45_minute
-PRON- keep tell -PRON- that -PRON- be on probation at work and have to get back on time but dr. kristin agius do_not_care and keep -PRON- back to see how_much money -PRON- could squeeze out of -PRON-
-PRON- could_not tell what be wrong with -PRON- dog and suggest that -PRON- have x_ray do then more x_ray and then a blood sample
-PRON- quote -PRON- $ 500 for the first set of x_ray so all of these step would have cost under_$ 1000 just to figure_out_what be wrong with -PRON-
after -PRON- say -PRON- could_not afford -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- many suggestion on how -PRON- can borrow money to pay -PRON-
-PRON- also charge_$ 22 to write a prescription as -PRON- be a service -PRON- be provide
-PRON- have never hear another vet charge to write a prescription
-PRON- become very clear to -PRON- that dr. kristin agius be a money grabber
-PRON- be also turn_off when -PRON- walk_into -PRON- room with a very sick dog and -PRON- be make comment about how -PRON- be bring in a pony
-PRON- go away agree to have the x_ray do -PRON- be go to charge -PRON- boarding to keep -PRON- dog there for x_ray for 4 hour while -PRON- go_back to work and then come_back to pick -PRON- up but decide to credit -PRON- for -PRON- seriously
when -PRON- pick -PRON- up -PRON- think -PRON- have kennel cough and give -PRON- antibiotic for $_100
-PRON- then follow_up via email and after -PRON- tell -PRON- how -PRON- dog be not eat food -PRON- suggest that -PRON- bring -PRON- dog back and hospitalize -PRON- on iv plus do bloodwork ultrasound repeat x_ray and these diagnostic would cost in the thousand -PRON- provide all the pricing
-PRON- also recommend that -PRON- take out a loan to finance this medical care and suggest either a bank or petcard.ca
-PRON- never take -PRON- back to the vet and -PRON- get good with the antibiotic
this vet just give -PRON- a big scare and charge -PRON- $ 500 for a couple of x_ray and a bottle_of pill which -PRON- do_not even have a full supply of and -PRON- have to come_back to pick_up the rest
avoid this vet at all cost
bj be a favorite for -PRON- family
there be always something for everyone when -PRON- come to food and beer_selection
depend_on the time of day -PRON- arrive -PRON- will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot
one trick -PRON- use to do grow_up that -PRON- still do be drop one person off at the door to put -PRON- name down while the other park
-PRON- save time
at bj -PRON- have a skinny menu that tell -PRON- the calorie for the item
for those_who do_not_care there plenty_of high calorie tasty menu_item as well- burgers pizza flatbread etc bj have also jump on the sriracha band wagon a favorite hot_sauce to -PRON- asians
-PRON- have create a mac and cheese with sriracha sauce
amazing
-PRON- daughter like this dish
and -PRON- have take several bite off -PRON- plate -PRON- do like -PRON-
if -PRON- want something spicy or have kid that have jump on the sriracha bandwagon this be a goto -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- low calorie item like the seared ahi_tuna salad or -PRON- quinoa bowl
the ahi_tuna salad be just fantastic
a large bowl of green with dab of wasabi sauce on the side of the dish
the ahi_tuna be nicely sear and add a fab protein
highly_recommend
a generic sport_bar with ample outdoor space
the food be standard and fine but unimpressive
-PRON- could have be any american food mall restaurant with salad rib buffalo wing nachos chicken tender sandwich beer etc
just nothing impressive
if someone want to go there -PRON- will go_back with -PRON- but -PRON- would never be -PRON- first choice
-PRON- rarely go to swiss but the experience at_this_location overall be disappointing
first -PRON- wife order a healthy option with a vegetable medley
the vegetable come cold and raw
when -PRON- mention this susan insist that the vegetable be raw because -PRON- be fresh
-PRON- ponder if -PRON- be fresh from the ice block downstairs or from the microwave
why would -PRON- respond like that instead_of say -PRON- would fix the issue
-PRON- wife then sit there for quite a_bit of time before -PRON- get a replacement
when -PRON- ask for a diet coke -PRON- bring an_iced tea
why all the hate
when -PRON- ask for utensil for -PRON- son who be not provide with any susan then say fork or spoon
then -PRON- dig into a wicker basket behind -PRON- and say here be fork
not_sure where this animosity when come from
-PRON- be good hardworking folk
finally ask for the bill then wait ten minutes while susan seem to avoid -PRON- table -PRON- fear of another complaint
do_not think -PRON- will be head back there
first_off -PRON- think -PRON- be hilarious that some people be take off star and confuse about the raman offering here think that -PRON- need to pay extra for noodle or add in item and not order -PRON- at all instead_of simply ask about -PRON-
have eat in raman shop up and down the eastern and western coast -PRON- feel_like -PRON- have to say this be simply how raman be list
now on to the actual review
have drunken quite a fair bit and need some food before resume the aforementioned drinking fellow_yelper jonathon b.
and -PRON- stumble in here at around 9:30 10 for some grub
well -PRON- have to say the place look kinda cool
unfortunately -PRON- happen to be here at the bad possible time as a humongous group_of people decide on this joint as the place to celebrate a birthday bash
believe -PRON- -PRON- be highly annoying when all -PRON- can hear during a meal be constantly chug chug chug and fuck yeah bro
believe -PRON- or not -PRON- be okay to tell -PRON- guest to respect the other guest around -PRON- and stop yell in -PRON- establishment
spying monkfish liver on the menu -PRON- go with -PRON- because who do_not love the foie_gra of the sea as_an_appetizer
-PRON- regret -PRON-
while the texture be excellent the pairing of salmon ikura on_top leaf -PRON- taste so fishy that the pool of vinegar at the bottom fail to brace -PRON- down to tolerable level
-PRON- also try some of -PRON- dining partner 's beef negimaki
the beef be nice the asparagus be well cook but the presentation make -PRON- pretty hard to eat
shortly afterwards -PRON- raman come_out though and -PRON- be pretty_good
the broth be very porky make -PRON- wonder_if -PRON- do_not do the traditional parboiling to neutralize some of that or something
anyways -PRON- like -PRON- but some people may not
the side item strew throughout the soup be adequate if not amazing
the extremely major flaw -PRON- actually point out to the server be that -PRON- have list a flavor egg as an item in the soup but all -PRON- have get be a hard boil egg cut in half
-PRON- be meet with an actual shrug of the shoulder and an eh
hey -PRON- ask how everything be girl
seriously though this be not how -PRON- should respond to an honest critique please train -PRON- waitstaff better
in conclusion and the word of -PRON- server eh shoulder shrug
recently come_across this store could't resist but to purchase some item because the price be amazing in comparison to other sportswear brand lululemon lole etc
and i must_say i love love
love -PRON-
-PRON- feel good and i look good in -PRON- clothe
the staff be extremely knowledgable and helpful when -PRON- come to find -PRON- right size
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this brand to anyone and will_definitely be return
-PRON- have be here quite a_few time include last_night
-PRON- like this_place
-PRON- be a solid choice for food and drink
-PRON- friend and -PRON- head to the patio
-PRON- have a yummy dish and a beer
-PRON- just have a beer
the patio be awesome although get to -PRON- be confusing for new comer
-PRON- like the vibe -PRON- be very lay_back
-PRON- remember eat_here year_ago and be happy with -PRON- meal
-PRON- only_complaint and -PRON- be not really a complaint be that the service be a_bit slow
other_than_that great space for food drink and a catch_up
-PRON- have be around for as long as -PRON- can remember and -PRON- think in_toronto that say a lot
-PRON- go here with -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- be not_sure what to expect
-PRON- have be to brgr and burgatory before and have not be overly impressed
-PRON- be pleasantly surprise by the industrial decor upon_enter
the service be fast and friendly
when -PRON- order -PRON- have originally plan to get a mini burger but -PRON- server suggest the large as -PRON- be twice the portion_size for a $_3 up charge
-PRON- food come_out_quickly -PRON- have the maggie 's farm and -PRON- girlfriend have the fox chapel
both of -PRON- be very_impressed
-PRON- go as_far as to say that -PRON- be the good burger that -PRON- have have
-PRON- would certainly put -PRON- in -PRON- top 5
-PRON- both decide to get the rosemary fries as an upgrade and theh be flavorful and refreshing
the portion be spot on and leave both of -PRON- feel satisfied but not_overly full
-PRON- will_definitely be come_back here when -PRON- be in_town next_time
very affordable for the amount_of food
also the food be deliciously tasty
clean establishment quick take out friendly_staff
-PRON- share -PRON- thali with a friend as there be plenty_of food
not really a place -PRON- would drive across the city for but if -PRON- be in this hood this_place be a must if -PRON- be a local
-PRON- hear that kawaii be under new ownership and recently have a perfect maricopa health inspection
so -PRON- think -PRON- could give kawaii another try
-PRON- order the most common of sushi to try that should be fresh
a salmon surprise roll and sushi of tuna and yellowtail
when the sushi come_out -PRON- know immediately that this be not pristine fresh as -PRON- should be
see close up of yellowtail photo
honestly -PRON- never have sushi anywhere that look that bad include budget buffet
-PRON- take a chance eat the sushi
the sushi be put loosely together and most of the piece fall_apart when -PRON- eat -PRON-
the tuna and yellowtail piece be not season under the fish as -PRON- should be
really the worst tasting of the sushi be the salmon surprise roll
-PRON- be the only one that have an actual raw_fish taste to -PRON-
-PRON- guess raw_fish taste be the surprise
none_of the sushi really taste fresh
-PRON- only like fresh sushi
this sushi -PRON- do_not like and be why some people will not eat sushi
a while latter -PRON- stomach ache
but -PRON- do_not get sick
if -PRON- do_not have any fresh fish the server should have suggest a stir_fry to -PRON-
bye bye kawaii and sayonara
-PRON- will not be back
-PRON- do_not understand the review for poor_customer_service and item not function
-PRON- know for a fact_that -PRON- test everything -PRON- get in and test every item before -PRON- sell -PRON-
when -PRON- go in -PRON- can even see where -PRON- test the game and system behind the counter
anyways this_place be awesome
the 2 that own -PRON- be super_nice and helpful if -PRON- be look for something specific -PRON- have be greet_by a smile and ask if -PRON- need any help look for anything every_time -PRON- have come in
-PRON- price be very good for cart only game as_well_as complete boxed games(if -PRON- be a collector of any kind
-PRON- be different from other retro game store in the way that -PRON- do_not have 100 nintendo game with 99 of -PRON- be sport title and the 1 leave over be mario\/duckhunt
what -PRON- have be quality game from past and present
-PRON- have nes snes n64 sega genesis sega megadrive sega dreamcast atari 2600 ps1 ps2 ps3 xbox xbox360 and even more
not to mention -PRON- be one of the only place -PRON- have see that sell system for a decent price(no $_80 yellow super nintendo 's here
-PRON- also have free to play game cabinet set_up if -PRON- want to get the nostalgia juice flow with some metal slug or street fighter
even if -PRON- do_not have something -PRON- want just let -PRON- know_what -PRON- be
and -PRON- will take down -PRON- name number and whatev -PRON- be -PRON- be look for and give -PRON- a call when -PRON- come in
all and all this be a great place no_matter if -PRON- be a modern gamer retro collector or just look for that game that kick -PRON- butt when -PRON- be a kid

the fish selection be the good -PRON- have see
-PRON- have several fish -PRON- have never even hear of before and many -PRON- have never see available before at a valley store
the coral selection be very good as_well although not as exceptional compare to other local fish store
the selection of invert be good -PRON- have all the basic -PRON- would need for a solid cleanup crew but -PRON- would say this be one area that could use a little improvement
all of the display be gorgeous and well_maintain the store have a great ambiance when -PRON- walk_in and -PRON- have a pretty_good selection of tank and supply
the only_downside to this store be that -PRON- seem -PRON- would pay 10 20 more for a lot_of the livestock
also although the staff seem quite knowledgeable -PRON- be also rather rude on -PRON- late experience and just indifferent on -PRON- previous
not very courteous
what a nice little treat
-PRON- stop_by the shack to give the hippies a try
-PRON- instantly enjoy the decor and feel of the place
quaintness abound funky poster kitschy knick knack and bright color give -PRON- a groovy feel
while not someplace -PRON- would bring the whole family
this be a good place to stop for a quick_bite or a snack
this be not a sit_down eat establishment -PRON- go in place -PRON- order try the three taco combo and then wait outside

-PRON- must mention that the owner make -PRON- feel right at home and be super_nice and even funny
-PRON- attitude be a big plus and make the eat more enjoyable
-PRON- be easy to see -PRON- enjoy -PRON- work
on september 2 -PRON- bring -PRON- lab in for acupuncture
-PRON- be tell by another doctor at another animal_hospital -PRON- dog sprain -PRON- knee
-PRON- primary vet be out of town and thought let -PRON- try and help with the swelling of -PRON- knee because the dog could_not walk
when the doctor see -PRON- dog -PRON- immediately say and -PRON- quote -PRON- can_not help -PRON- dog with acupuncture because -PRON- blow out -PRON- knee
what
now -PRON- be in panick mode worry for -PRON- dog how do this happen
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- need to prpare -PRON- for surgery as_soon as_possible
let -PRON- get the blood work do today so -PRON- can meet with the surgeon -PRON- recommend and who come up from tuscon

then -PRON- come_back in two week to see the surgeon -PRON- take ex ray etc
say oh yes -PRON- dog need knee surgery at the cost of $ 2300.00 minimum
that consultaion with the surgeon be another $ 276.00
the surgeon then say go home start to walk -PRON- dog 5_minute a day building up to 20_minute a day over the next 4 week and call -PRON- to let -PRON- know -PRON- progress

-PRON- be baffle at this point
but -PRON- listen to the idiot
here -PRON- be 4 week_later -PRON- dog be not do well
-PRON- call -PRON- to ask if -PRON- can see -PRON- to get go on this knee surgery
but oh -PRON- be on_vacation
and -PRON- be bother -PRON- obviously
at_least that be the impression -PRON- give -PRON-
so furious with -PRON- lack of concern -PRON- decide not to seek any more advice from this facility and get yet another opinion from another doctor who finally diagnose -PRON- dog correctly
much to -PRON- surprise -PRON- dog have perfectly healthy knees
no degeneration what so ever
in_fact -PRON- strain -PRON- iliopsoas muscle
needless_to_say what a disappointment
time money tear lose because of the misdiagnosis
now finally -PRON- dog be in phyical therapy in the proper care and finally on the long slow road to recovery
thank for nothing
bob never_fail -PRON-
the combination pan roast be amazing as_usual

but -PRON- absolutely_love the combination an roast
and -PRON- husband the chicken gumbo
margie provide great service and be really nice and accommodate
rip ms deloris -PRON- love -PRON-
only be for coffee and light food fare
food be pricy and atmosphere may be try too hard
-PRON- try -PRON- hardest to support local and support downtown but may be a miss for -PRON-
the one worker have a really saucy attitude not to be expect at such a place
will give -PRON- another shot
this be an ok place to go and hang_out with some friend after work and maybe get some chip and salsa
-PRON- go there for dinner and -PRON- be basically what -PRON- would expect from a chain mexican_restaurant
-PRON- be not impressed
there be much good place to go if -PRON- be in the mood for mexican_food
the food here be pretty_good
-PRON- feel that the burger a dollar or two above -PRON- worth but_hey -PRON- be on the vegas strip
and that be what -PRON- pay if -PRON- want something besides mc ds
-PRON- have spike milk shake
so if -PRON- be an alcoholic or like alcohol then -PRON- may like this_place
-PRON- want to thank the bartender for ask -PRON- if -PRON- want -PRON- with alcohol or not
-PRON- order the billionaire buger
-PRON- be a burger name after one of the owner -PRON- be assume bill
-PRON- be price accurately for a burger with foie_gra and -PRON- come with fry
-PRON- can_not accurately rate the burger because -PRON- eat -PRON- at the hotel and do_not have a chance to taste -PRON- as_soon_as -PRON- be make
-PRON- want to share with -PRON- friend
over all -PRON- like the burger but -PRON- think -PRON- kinda over pay
the burger be good but -PRON- be not roll back -PRON- eye omfg wtf bbq good
update review
after a day the chrome start chip off and the gel_polish be come off as_well
no offense
but -PRON- pay_$ 100 before tip to get only -PRON- nail do and this be unacceptable
way_too overprice for bad quality
come_here last_night to get -PRON- nail do
staff be very accommodate the manager even provide complimentary mimosa
-PRON- love that -PRON- be close by the strip and open_late perfect for both people that be visit and for local as_well
kristy be -PRON- nail tech\/artist
and -PRON- be absolutely_amazing
-PRON- love -PRON- sense of humor
and -PRON- love how -PRON- be very particular with -PRON- work and take -PRON- time
-PRON- listen and deliver exactly_what -PRON- ask for
-PRON- do_not even have to tell -PRON- to fix something bump uneven shape etc because -PRON- throughly double_check everything so that -PRON- nail look flawless by the time -PRON- leave
price wise -PRON- would say this_place may be on the high_end
but at the same time -PRON- have never get a design on all 10 finger
so -PRON- be not_sure what to compare -PRON- too
but overall -PRON- definitely think -PRON- be worth -PRON-
and -PRON- be happy
the husband and -PRON- get the deep tissue massage for $ 30\/hour
-PRON- have a mostly private room that hold up to four people but -PRON- be the only two people in the entire place for most of the time today
warm foot soak follow_by the massage of the neck and shoulder first
then stretch out onto the rest_of the chair for the remainder of the massage which include some hot stone which be nice
definitely like lazy man yoga but -PRON- be happy and relaxed camper upon exit
definitely will keep this_place in -PRON- to do list on future vegas trip

-PRON- trout be excellent but the pizza be not very good
the mussel come cover in some kind_of heavy sauce but the french_fry be good
seem_like a very local place which be nice with lot_of regular
skip the brownie dessert -PRON- be dry and burn with cherry inside the creme caramel be much good
delicious and truly authentic ala carte filipino restaurant
-PRON- entire family decide to have dinner there and enjoy -PRON- experience
staff be attentive menu selection be plentiful and food be amazing
take all -PRON- relative from the east_coast there for sure
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have a lovely dinner at the palm at ceasar 's palace last_week
both filet_mignon piece be excellent and service be top_notch
-PRON- only ding be for the amount_of noise in the palm during dinner
really do_not expect that
please take note that if -PRON- be try to find this inside ceasar 's palace that the walk to the shop and restaurant be fill with the stench of cigarette_smoke from the decade of smoking at the ceasar 's casino
-PRON- do_not d the palm for that but -PRON- want to lt -PRON- be aware of that
both devacurl stylist be amazing
the parlor be a very low_key but modern salon
-PRON- drive a long way to get there
but -PRON- be totally_worth -PRON-
-PRON- love that -PRON- get text to remind -PRON- about -PRON- appointment and when -PRON- first stylist leave doug call -PRON- to tell -PRON- when the new devacurl stylist be available
yeah -PRON- be cheap
yeah
the $_10 ticket get -PRON- 24_hour access to the montreal subway\/bus system
yeah even many bus have wifi
but to buy the ticket on the bus -PRON- must have cash
in wait for -PRON-
coin only
this be totally lame
depend_on how the machine be work inside the airport -PRON- may not be able_to buy a ticket any_other way
after wait two and a half_hour for -PRON- food and call four time the woman -PRON- speak too blame -PRON- for not answer -PRON- phone
the reason -PRON- do_not answer be because -PRON- call the wrong number which -PRON- also type incorrectly on the receipt which the driver show -PRON- while -PRON- apologize for the stupidity of -PRON- coworker
the food be horrible
-PRON- feed -PRON- to -PRON- dog
avoid at all costs
-PRON- eat two type_of fry_rice and chicken dish
all on the table agree -PRON- be probably the good chinese_food -PRON- eat outside china
delicious food upscale ambience though -PRON- be very brightly light
service be great except -PRON- get -PRON- soup after get some of the main
this be the bad hotel -PRON- have stay_at
-PRON- be dirty run_down and the staff do_not_care
-PRON- check in to -PRON- room very late in the evening
the slide glass door be break and do_not lock
-PRON- call maintenance -PRON- come twice and could_not fix -PRON-
-PRON- move to another room
this room look_like someone puke all over the carpet
the toilet leak
there be a very loud party go on next to -PRON- which last until 7 a.m.
the next night -PRON- room key quit work
-PRON- go to the front_desk twice to get -PRON- rescann but -PRON- still do_not work
-PRON- have to have security escort -PRON- to -PRON- room
so -PRON- could get in
steer clear of this dump
the food in this_place be worth the hassle on get on the bus $ 2\/person 1 way from the strip on a 90 degree weather
food be yummmmm
yummmmmm yummmmmmm
and -PRON- keep tell -PRON- bf
darn why do_not -PRON- open one in the bay_area
however -PRON- be a_bit turn_off by the overly honest and intimidate server when -PRON- first walk up to the counter
-PRON- have notice that -PRON- have a gift certificate on hand
and -PRON- be not too fond of -PRON-
well do_not participate on the discount website if -PRON- do_not wish people to use -PRON- then
*sigh
-PRON- agree with some reviewer that the price be quiet steep for burger and fry
-PRON- spend about $ 26 for 1 pastrami burger 1 regular pastrami sandwich 1 bacon cheese fry and 2 drink
but well -PRON- load quiet lot_of pastrami on -PRON-
so no_complaint about that
although -PRON- be weird the food though -PRON- be huge look
didn't seem to last in -PRON- stomach long
-PRON- be hungry again in a couple hour
-PRON- definitely plan to come_back when -PRON- be in_vegas
but for those_who be interested to try please make_sure -PRON- be not super hungry when -PRON- get there though -PRON- be a fast_food
the service be pretty slow
-PRON- only have 1 cook and 1 server and lot_of customer not_sure if -PRON- be due_to an afternoon
lunch time though visit
but -PRON- take about 20_minute to get -PRON- food
so that be quiet a wait
but worth -PRON-
yummy
-PRON- have be here_several_time for lunch and a couple time for breakfast
-PRON- really_enjoy the sandwich available for lunch and -PRON- often buy some kind_of pastry to take to -PRON- husband that -PRON- really love
-PRON- have be a while since -PRON- have breakfast here in the past and -PRON- decide to stop in again today
-PRON- order the ham gruyere cheese frittata
-PRON- quickly realize that -PRON- be the same_thing -PRON- order on -PRON- previous breakfast visit
the cheese taste more like a brie to -PRON- which be not -PRON- favorite
the potato and toast be good
-PRON- would probably return for breakfast and try_something_else
-PRON- will_definitely_come_back for lunch because the sandwich be sooo good
come_here for a fun late_night game of miniature golf with friend
while the parking_lot be mostly empty and a_few family inside the staff be attentive but mainly focus_on clean up
why three_star
well there be a terrible sewage smell everywhere
most of the golf course be soak and the stench of the smell be everywhere
make playing nauseate
other_than_that -PRON- be fair pricing and friendly_staff
as a side_note the course could use more lights\/lamp at night
some part of -PRON- be so dark -PRON- could_barely see
-PRON- barley finish -PRON- aesthetic course
but -PRON- do
and -PRON- be no thank to the instructor
this school be only interested_in get -PRON- to hopefully pass the state exam for licensing and not teach -PRON- even the basic
-PRON- focus mainly on -PRON- hour and testing but -PRON- must_say that 80 in this field should be hand on and there be not much teaching in that
the instructor as_well_as the administration staff be very unprofessional
please look elsewhere for beauty school
school be not cheap this be -PRON- fair warning
super lecker essen allerding mit langen wartezeiten ist zu rechnen wenn das restaurant mehr al halb voll ist aber alle in allem sehr empfehlenswert
club be outdat and dumpy
this_place should never have a cover
drink be way overpriced and water_down
most boy be ok to look_at
julio aka keith williams take -PRON- to the back room for a private dance
what a mistake -PRON- could bairley stand up because -PRON- be so mess_up and then shove -PRON- hand in -PRON- short and ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to take -PRON- home or need and good
place go from fantasy to trash pretty_quickly
would not go_back
not a bad selection for all -PRON- can eat sushi but -PRON- have be to good with other when place order with an ipad
restaurant be busy for lunch and -PRON- do bring_out -PRON- food fast which be an add bonus
wish -PRON- have more tofu option on the menu

john be extremely smart in -PRON- trade

-PRON- would trust john with any watch -PRON- own from a simple invicta or timex to -PRON- rolex
give -PRON- a shot and -PRON- to will soon find -PRON- have a friend in the watch business
best italian restaurant in arizona
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- can ever move out of state -PRON- would miss this_place too_much
-PRON- free dinner bread be the good bread around
-PRON- do_not_know_what -PRON- do to -PRON- but -PRON- eat at_least 3 loaf each_time -PRON- go
-PRON- adult mac and cheese be like nothing -PRON- have ever taste
-PRON- spicy but ohhh so delicious
-PRON- steak and blue salad be outstanding

$_12 a plate on average with free unlimited delicious bread ummmm yes
please
everything -PRON- try here be delicious
fried_chicken be great as be the crispy shrimp caesar_salad
drink be a little on the expensive side- $_6 for a beer
cute atmosphere and a nice patio with heat lamp
how sad be -PRON- that mehran close
-PRON- be new to the toronto area and live in college park
live in the california bay_area turn -PRON- into a true snob when -PRON- come to desi food
-PRON- have a particular inclination towards north indian\/pakistani cuisine as the flavor be just so rich
-PRON- be a challenge finding place that match up to -PRON- expectation but mehran have meet the mark
the flavor be spot on
the spice be perfect
the texture and ratio of ingredient be fantastic
-PRON- naan be great
plus -PRON- rotate -PRON- selection often
and -PRON- be always impressed that when -PRON- get a particular craving somehow -PRON- know and the item be there
the other day -PRON- have a hankering for chana dal kadu
-PRON- buy a kadu at loblaws and figure -PRON- would go to mehran and buy some chana dal curry and simmer some kadu into -PRON-
low and behold -PRON- have chana dal kadu that day
hello happiness
now buyer beware this be not a romantic restaurant spot
in_fact -PRON- think the average diner would be turn_off just to see this_place from the outside
-PRON- look_like a desi diner and -PRON- guess in some way -PRON- be
the food be on display and -PRON- choose what -PRON- want and -PRON- heat -PRON- and pack -PRON- up
-PRON- can eat in but do_not expect a fine_dining experience
-PRON- ok by -PRON- but -PRON- figure full disclosure be important
this_place be great
fresh_ingredient -PRON- make -PRON- way -PRON- like that a drink be include in the price of -PRON- bowl
friendly service
the outcome of -PRON- work be delicious
very fill
-PRON- will for sure make this a regular place to visit
and -PRON- serve booze
-PRON- admit -PRON- expectation be pretty high base_on the other_review and word of mouth advertising on this_place
base_on that admittedly high_expectation -PRON- will say overall -PRON- be disappoint
-PRON- go with a friend and -PRON- order the table side guacamole pollo poblano and pescado del March
the guacamole be about average
nothing_special our also have cranberry instead_of the pomegranate seed
the pollo poblano be definitely a good dish than the pescado del mar tender chicken and a pretty_good sauce
the pescado del mar be the disappointing part of the meal
the dish be serve warm not hot by any mean and the seafood be cook inconsistently
the shrimp and lobster be fine but the halibut and scallop be cook unevenly some part be fine while other seem undercooked
the potato serve with both dish be the good part of the meal
-PRON- also have the specialty margarita of the day which be very_tasty but -PRON- agree -PRON- be slightly overprice $_15
-PRON- server be exceptional and the staff in_general be very_friendly
will -PRON- go there again
-PRON- may roll the dice and try another dish like the cochinita pibil
overall an ok experience that -PRON- think be slightly overprice $ 110 dinner and a drink for 2 include the tip
room be dingy oddly lay out with a tiny dirty bathroom
giant cart of dirty towel sit_outside out room from check in until 11_p.m. or so even after -PRON- ask for the removal of -PRON-
front entrance and bar reek of some_sort_of cheap scent
anyone with allergy should avoid
bartender do_not_know basic drink like an_old fashioned
-PRON- have room service for dinner and breakfast very slow presentation be not on_par with a luxury experience in any way
very very sub_par experience
extremely noisy from the street outside all night until about 4 a.m.
jackie chan 's favorite and the sexy albacore roll be -PRON- favorite
the banana dessert be amazing
have happy hr and groupon special
by_far the good cane 's -PRON- have be to
the line move quickly and -PRON- have -PRON- food 30 second after take -PRON- seat
the food be fresh hot crunchy and of good quality
as -PRON- be gather -PRON- trash an_employee come over and offer to finish clean up for -PRON- wish -PRON- a good day with a pleasant smile on -PRON- face and -PRON- be on -PRON- way

and that be life
-PRON- have huge ride roller coaster and a bunch_of carnival game to arcade game
-PRON- also have a separate section of arcade game and cranial game -PRON- also have performer perform every 30min or so
and the show be great
-PRON- be a must
-PRON- do_not think the place be anything special but -PRON- would not mind come_back if -PRON- be in the area
-PRON- have a bratwurst with sauerkraut and a white hot wife have the regular burger and the kid have chili dog and a burger
-PRON- do_not think the white hot be spicy at all and the bratwurst be lack flavor
the wife say the burger be just the right size and the kid like -PRON- food
-PRON- do_not think the food be bad but -PRON- would not go out of -PRON- way for -PRON-
-PRON- charge 25 cent for a refill but the large soda -PRON- order be more_than sufficient for the meal and -PRON- do_not need a refill at all
-PRON- love change hand
-PRON- be more_than a bookstore -PRON- also have great gift and unique trinket
don't be supris if -PRON- walk_out of the store with 5 more thing than -PRON- intend to buy
the staff be wonderful
i've call 2 different time to look for a book -PRON- could_not find includingone that be out of print and both time the associate -PRON- speak with take the time not only to look in the computer but also check the shelf for -PRON-
this be a great place to hang_out and just browse as_well
plus -PRON- smell like book new and old which if -PRON- could bottle and wear daily -PRON- would
this be definitely a solid spot for a great price chinese_restaurant
-PRON- have the shrimp in garlic_sauce and then honey_walnut shrimp
both be really good
-PRON- have the fry_rice as_well but be not a big_fan
-PRON- be hard and undercooked
noodle be spot on
worth a try
-PRON- like the halloween display
interesting selection of costume and other item that be not find in similar store
would come_back_again
great overall experience
the only_downside be there be a lot_of bug around the outside of the ice_cream container which be concern
otherwise the ice_cream be great and the customer_service be good
have not be to this hd location in a while
the last_time -PRON- leave a lot to be desire but this trip be quite nice
the store be clean and -PRON- have plenty_of the gardening supply -PRON- be after at a terrific price
the staff be very courteous and helpful as_well
stella 's be one of those place where -PRON- think -PRON- could be awesome because -PRON- seem family_own quaint and accord to restaurant.com -PRON- should be get a good deal
.wrong
the pizza be average after have danny boys and frankie 's this pizza just do_not cut -PRON- for -PRON-
maybe that be why -PRON- be able_to get a $_25 gift certificate on restaurant.com for for only $_3
needless_to_say stella -PRON- do_not win -PRON- fine italian heart over
3.5_star
a_few friend and -PRON- decide to check this_place out to get some food and some drink and just chill
locate on a side street -PRON- do_not look_like much from the outside
but wow when -PRON- enter in through the drape
-PRON- look so fancy inside in that dark and sexy vibe
have no reservation -PRON- group_of 7 have no issue get a table
the menu for food be not extensive but interesting at_least the dinner\/late night menu the drink be all unique and lovely sound
-PRON- have the cucumber collins with coriander
-PRON- love coriander and will pretty_much order anything with -PRON- in -PRON-
-PRON- have a light and refreshing taste with that coriander syrup really come through
yum for -PRON-
as -PRON- only want something to nibble on -PRON- decide on the olive and bread snack
-PRON- be ok olive and bread
-PRON- can_not screw that up too_much lol
other at the table order wing yum and some cheese tater_tot thing also good
another person have a burger -PRON- do_not have a bite but other who do say -PRON- be really juicy and good
-PRON- find the service a little lacking -PRON- seem after a while there be only one server
-PRON- be very polite and nice but -PRON- take_awhile to get -PRON- order in the food and then to pay
the restaurant be about half to 3\/4 full when -PRON- be there
so -PRON- think -PRON- need another server later in the evening
however this would not stop -PRON- from come_back
per -PRON- sign -PRON- also do brunch
so -PRON- definitely want to check that out soon
pretty_good chicken shawarma for the price $_6 very flavourful
the service be amazing and super_fast
great place for a quick_bite
-PRON- add just a regular hot_wing sauce which -PRON- can have on the side or good yet dip
this be amazing
-PRON- new_favorite pizza spot
affordable and the delivery be pretty quick
-PRON- also follow -PRON- specification when -PRON- order and make_sure everything be cook well do just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
mark be absolutely_amazing
-PRON- walk_in yesterday to see if -PRON- could get a consultation and set_up an_appointment for -PRON- tattoo
-PRON- want two tattoo that be pretty small and dainty so mark be able_to squeeze -PRON- in
-PRON- do an arrow on -PRON- right arm and a rose on -PRON- right hip -PRON- be perfect
the line be so straight and -PRON- be everything -PRON- want thank -PRON- mark
service be on_par although -PRON- do hear the waitress complain_about get a small tip from the table next to -PRON-
one of the diner want sriracha sauce to add to the raman and be tell there be none
which lead to a full blown inquiry amongst -PRON- friend of whether -PRON- be at a japanese restaurant or not and why would not -PRON- have sriracha
-PRON- seating be too close to other and that constant complaining be get in on -PRON- dining_experience
the raman be ok
the noodle do_not meld with the broth as much as -PRON- have hop and taste as though -PRON- have be recently boil which be good but lack that oomph
hub get the sesame raman but under the lighting -PRON- could_not tell what -PRON- be until -PRON- get home and pour out the leftover
-PRON- be a white broth not yellow from the lighting
there be not much flavor to the sesame raman but thankfully -PRON- order the more flavorful shoyu tonkatsu
the appetizer be decent
-PRON- order the skewer shrimp and curry_chicken wing
one of -PRON- wing which be large than the other two be undercooked
-PRON- will try -PRON- again once thing get more establish maybe
-PRON- be so shocked by the previous review about the bad service
-PRON- have be take -PRON- car there forever and johnny and -PRON- whole team have be nothing but top_notch
-PRON- always treat -PRON- like -PRON- be 1
and -PRON- also really_appreciate about -PRON- be that -PRON- do_not ever over charge -PRON- do_not push -PRON- around and -PRON- just tell -PRON- how -PRON- be and do what -PRON- can to help -PRON-
-PRON- recommend_this_place absolutely
-PRON- do_not feel_comfortable take -PRON- vehicle anywhere_else
thank oasis -PRON- guy rock
after be under the weather all weekend when lunch on_monday roll around -PRON- be not feel_like walk_in 93 degree steamy heat to get some food
luckily -PRON- see that potbelly deliver
-PRON- online ordering process be easy to use -PRON- deliver when promise and the order arrive complete with all the appropriate temperature
-PRON- get the chicken salad flatbread and a frozen strawberry lemonade
very_tasty
can_not wait until -PRON- feel good and the heat tone -PRON- down a notch
so -PRON- can visit the shop
other then the view the place be a dump do_not_waste -PRON- time and money eat_here either
service be great and the staff be very_friendly but -PRON- be a roach motel in the sky
also very awkward have to go thru a metal detector on_vacation to go see the view
-PRON- be one of those place -PRON- be glad to have near -PRON- work because -PRON- do_not feel all that bad about forget to pack a lunch
only have go during the day saloon offer a varied lunch menu with plenty_of option at three_different price bracket
the service be fast and friendly and the kitchen be consistent
whether -PRON- be in the mood for a sandwich or burger or perhaps a healthy alternative -PRON- recommend the salmon with roasted veggie and mash_potato
-PRON- be sure to find something tasty without break the bank
-PRON- have go_back multiple_time and will_continue do so
-PRON- be at a d backs game and -PRON- wife suggest -PRON- hold off on crappy stadium food and hit the pasta bar
downtown_phoenix be not exactly know for great place to eat exclude bianco and the entire metro area in maricopa county be not know for place that stay open_late
so -PRON- be a pleasant surprise to see that the pasta bar stay open until 2_a.m.
-PRON- locate_in the back of a little strip_mall and could be a little challenging to find
the décor be metro hip and reflect the slowly change character of downtown_phoenix
the pasta bar specialize_in one thing homemade italian pasta serve in bowl
do_not go expect ordinary pasta
these dish be from the mother country
the ingredient be stellar and -PRON- will be glad -PRON- come
-PRON- see several people complain at the price
the pasta bar be not the olive_garden
-PRON- really a pasta specialty house and -PRON- will pay more for the quality of ingredient and all -PRON- pasta be home make
-PRON- wife have the orricheite spelling -PRON- know and -PRON- have the pasta with the ribeye steak in -PRON-
both be really good
-PRON- also share some fry mozzarella
while some find the portion small -PRON- find -PRON- more_than adequate
and -PRON- be an eater
-PRON- do get a side of the meatball which be out of this_world
if -PRON- down in_phoenix and look for a place that stay open past 9 just like the big city try the pasta bar
frequent lunch spot service be normally good
super yummy spicy burrito could_not resist plenty_of flavor and sauce to pick from staff be super attentive great ice_tea fresh would come_back anytime and would_recommend to all
-PRON- order a box of eclairs and -PRON- be make fresh daily and fill while -PRON- wait
the standard filling be vanilla cream and -PRON- also have a_few with green_tea filling
-PRON- do_not last long when -PRON- bring -PRON- home and the family catch on
heyyyyyyyyyyyy what s in the box
omg grab grab grab
hmmm
so darn good
-PRON- highly_recommend have a plate underneath -PRON- as the filling be runny
and -PRON- could be wear -PRON- very quickly
-PRON- think -PRON- be runny as there seem to not be a ton sugar in -PRON- and a lot_of bind agent to thicken the creme which be a very good thing
no credit_card so bring cash if -PRON- order a dozen
if -PRON- check_out the box the name start to make a lot_of sense
next_time i drop by -PRON- will be cheese cake stick that look tasty
so happy with -PRON- service
very_professional on time and -PRON- team work really hard
-PRON- would_highly_recommend -PRON-
love the food here
-PRON- be a_bit pricy but definitely_worth -PRON-
-PRON- be lucky_enough that -PRON- have uni son today(sea urchin
everything from sea urchin to salmon to the rice be perfectly_cook
-PRON- also love -PRON- miso_soup and the salad
for desert -PRON- have crème brûlée -PRON- be ok but not as impressive as -PRON- don
-PRON- friend order the chef_'s choice that contain japanese fry_chicken which be also very_tasty
the other friend order the kaisen don(assort sashimi don which be also amazing
in all -PRON- all love each of -PRON- dish and -PRON- will_definitely_come_back to try out more
-PRON- may need to make an reservation if -PRON- come on saturday -PRON- be close on sunday since the restaurant be tiny
-PRON- be fortunate enough to sit_at the bar as all other seat be reserve
meilleure succursale allo mon coco
portion généreus service rapide et courtois très groupe friendly c' grand
la file est souvent très longue alor armez vous de patience et apportez vos mandala
si vous y allez à plusieur assurez vous d'arriver en même temp impossible d'attendre quelqu'un à sa table
le groupe doit être complet pour s'installer
cela dit un coup assis tout se passe très vite
seul hic majeur
les prix qui augmentent à une vitesse exponentielle
ça ça brise mon coeur de pauvre
j'y retournerai quand même parce que c' si bon
those fucker at the cosmo have the good buffet in_town
win a bunch_of money at the hard_rock casino and treat -PRON- family to an all -PRON- can eat buffet
the only_thing that would have make this good would have be an all -PRON- can drink option
-PRON- have everything from mac and cheese mini hot_dog weiner to hibachi seafood only grill_chicken beef and omg the gelato
-PRON- leave the buffet feeling as though -PRON- have a food child inside of -PRON-
-PRON- be pricey $ 44.00\/per person but -PRON- be so worth -PRON-
-PRON- do_not really have much other experience with this venue but after a quick walkthrough -PRON- can say that -PRON- be a nice place with a cool vibe and would definitely consider stay_here in the future
if -PRON- be in pittsburgh this_place would be consider quite good
that -PRON- be in the dining wasteland of the east suburbs immediately elevate -PRON- to great
wood_fire pizza an authentic pizza marguerita and an_excellent crust
-PRON- think -PRON- be still try to walk the fine line between what some of -PRON- customer probably expect put too_much stuff on the pizza and what -PRON- crust demand keep -PRON- a_bit dryer so that -PRON- do_not get soggy but give what -PRON- see and taste today
-PRON- have no doubt -PRON- will_continue to zero in on -PRON-
4_star and will be back regularly
yes chipotle be one of -PRON- favorite however as of late there have be food item unavailable last_week -PRON- be out of white_rice and today -PRON- have no lettuce
like really
get -PRON- together chipotle
or -PRON- will have to make viva chicken -PRON- stable
-PRON- have live in_las_vegas for 12 year and never know this even exist
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- move to henderson in may and -PRON- love the outdoor and be constantly look for new place to hike and get away_from the city
with that be say -PRON- boyfriend stumble_upon this_place research -PRON- area and just -PRON- luck -PRON- be 10_minute away_from -PRON- place
this_place be huge so -PRON- suggest -PRON- bring -PRON- running or walking shoe
-PRON- have amazing bike trail and little hidden pathway that -PRON- can explore as_well
-PRON- be very excited to bring -PRON- son here once the weather break
-PRON- make a reservation for 4_people a day before and get there 15_minute before the reservation time December 4 9_p.m. and what a surprise
the lady tell -PRON- that -PRON- be behind and -PRON- need to wait for another 30_minute
after spend useless time in the casino -PRON- approach the front_desk again and finally in 10_minute -PRON- walk -PRON- to outside table without even ask if -PRON- be comfortable with outside sitting by the way -PRON- be 40 degree f. -PRON- ask the lady at front if -PRON- could get complimentary glass of wine as a compensation for wait 40_minute with reservation -PRON- tell -PRON- with an attitude -PRON- can get a soft drink
nobody ever apologize to offer anything complimentary
the food arrive around 10:40 pm -PRON- order 1 bottle_of water -PRON- bring 2 $ 9\/each which remain on the table without touch
oh before -PRON- forget the meat be not season well not match with a high price so this be a big disappointment from the beginning to the end
the only positive thing -PRON- could say about this_place be the set_up of the table the restroom and the location
other_than_that please do_not spend_$ 100 for each person for the restaurant that be lack of simple customer_service
great flavor good consistency keep clean friendly_staff
even_though -PRON- change names\/ownership still -PRON- favorite yogurt in the valley
have the coconut berry slush
soo yum
there be only coconut milk inside so non dairy
great hotel
friendly great service all around
clean super comfortable quiet room
can_not say enough about the staff
the good
delicious but not worth the frustration
i will_never ever not listen to yelp_review ever again
there be a huge discrepancy between this_location and the original one at landsdowne but since this one be close -PRON- brunch partner and i decide to try -PRON-
-PRON- take -PRON- 2_hour between first get in line and to finally get -PRON- food
-PRON- be usually ok with a brunch wait
-PRON- be sometimes a part of the experience
but not when this wait to due_to an inability to a manage staff b hire staff or c train staff and this_location seem to be suffer from all of the above
the lineup be out the door and then entire time i peep through the window to see consistently empty table
when -PRON- finally make -PRON- inside the venue i ask the hostess about an empty table be that a real table
-PRON- be just two people
to which -PRON- respond -PRON- be but there be just a lot_of move part right_now
so if -PRON- read between the line -PRON- really mean that the kitchen could_not handle the volume
the kitchen be expose and i see two food cook one dishwasher and one drink person
-PRON- definitely could have use more staff
and since this be the second location by the same name i would expect the owner\/manager to have a leg up on how to manage a restaurant by now
yes the restaurant be spacious but there be no way that -PRON- could handle more capacity
-PRON- server be also very frazzled
-PRON- ask for the grill_cheese waffle with ham to which -PRON- respond with a confused grill_cheese
and -PRON- friend point at the menu and say yes the grill cheese"- point directly at the menu
-PRON- also order drink which do_not come
15_minute later -PRON- flag_down the owner and -PRON- ask -PRON- to follow_up
-PRON- come_back to double_check what variety_of tea i ask for
i tell -PRON- and -PRON- say that -PRON- be all out of that variety
so i settle for another
when -PRON- finally bring -PRON- drink 20_minute_later i double_check with -PRON- to make_sure that -PRON- food order be put in to which -PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- be
5_minute later -PRON- get -PRON- food
the food be very delicious
-PRON- order the starter of grill_cheese waffle with ham a main of the sammy benny which be -PRON- take on egg benny with smoked salmon on waffle of_course and a caramel pecan waffle for dessert
-PRON- probably should have go to the original location but since location be -PRON- chance to reel -PRON- in i will not be come_back
like what i say on -PRON- first line
this_place be delicious but just not worth -PRON-
admittedly -PRON- be neither super_excited nor super hungry when this suggestion be bring up by a friend
sometimes -PRON- feel that people go to a place just for the name
as a result a name can make a place somewhat mediocre while still draw in the people
the first sign of -PRON- popularity be the 90 minute wait
luckily for -PRON- -PRON- have make arrangement limit -PRON- wait to five_minute
although -PRON- be not hungry -PRON- could_not bring -PRON- to order a salad at a burger joint especially one that demand such a long_wait
not know if or when -PRON- may come_back -PRON- just go for a burger and figure -PRON- would just eat as much as -PRON- could
-PRON- go with the hell 's kitchen burger as -PRON- do_not_mind some heat
but -PRON- also seem_like -PRON- unofficial signature burger
-PRON- mean -PRON- could just get an american burger anywhere
one of the way -PRON- judge a burger be whether -PRON- can nail the way -PRON- be prepared
so_many place can_not get medium_rare to save -PRON- life
of_course quality of meat and seasoning be the other factor
this_place nail -PRON- all and what_happen next be -PRON- devour the entire burger
-PRON- be really good perhaps worth the wait and probably worth the name
ramsey get this one right and people know -PRON-
-PRON- be a believer
the sushi place to go to
close to the strip
$ 26.95 for all -PRON- can eat sushi
what be not to love
will_definitely be come_back every_time -PRON- come to vegas
if -PRON- love m&m be then this would be -PRON- idea of heaven
four floor of m&m goodness
cloths toy christmas decoration print and even chocolate can be obtain in the confectionery wonderland
nashville hot chicken waffle be the good
good_than the original if -PRON- like a little kick
-PRON- must order some chicken poutine fry too
must have in_vegas a must have
this_place use to be on regular rotation before -PRON- go vegetarian
-PRON- love the spam dish and adore the chicken katsu
-PRON- also be still frequently tempt by the kalua pig and cabbage
however now that -PRON- be vegetarian -PRON- have only be back twice
the most_recent_trip about a week_ago -PRON- enjoy stir_fry veggie rice and the veggie egg_roll
the stir_fry veggie make with butter and rice be absolutely_delicious
-PRON- only_complaint be that the diversity of veggie in the stir_fry be very_limited to cabbage carrot and maybe some pepper
-PRON- love the way ak make -PRON- rice and have no_complaint
the portion_size be also massive
as for the egg_roll -PRON- just do_not do -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- be cook okay but be pretty bland and the sauce with -PRON- do_not really help
the service at ak have always be good and this be no exception
-PRON- din with a co_worker and a family from the mid west who -PRON- have just meet
the family love -PRON- food and think -PRON- be very_flavorful
so if -PRON- be not use to hawaiian food this_place could change -PRON- life
-PRON- be glad to know -PRON- can get full on a plate of veggie and rice with enough leave over to take home for all under_$ 6.50
when appointment run_late and -PRON- have to wait that upset -PRON-
-PRON- time be worth as much as -PRON- time and -PRON- be a workday
courtesy call would have be nice -PRON- could have delay -PRON- arrival
ah yeah
bang bang-
this be the spot
very entertaining slightly interactive and -PRON- reside where the mobster trial be hold
cute item in gift_shop and affordable
discount ticket price for local and kid
have a great time
-PRON- agree with danica
no customer_service in this store even with a long_line on a saturday there be one active cashier with a guy_who clearly do_not want to jump on cash
only do -PRON- reluctantly and do_not even finish the transaction
employee also need to make_sure -PRON- chatting\/socializing be not slow down service
save -PRON- chat for when the store be not busy
this_place be really good
great ingredient
-PRON- have a special appreciation for restaurant that be not vegetarian but do a good job with the veggie
great service
elegant atmosphere but not too pretentious
also really near cmu campus
company should stop take people to lucca when this_place be only a two three block further
well drink be weak and the pretzel bite pizza and chicken_finger be nothing_special
however trivium night be a blast and the decor be right up -PRON- ally
-PRON- really want to like this_place but -PRON- be not for -PRON-
everything -PRON- have be a little too_sweet and buttery
the crackpie soft_serve be so rich and sweet -PRON- could_not finish -PRON-
the crackpie -PRON- be serve cold -PRON- do_not_know that
and -PRON- be too buttery so be the cookie -PRON- have
-PRON- actually prefer the crackpie -PRON- make -PRON- at home with the pie mix because -PRON- be warm
-PRON- try -PRON- friend cereal milk soft_serve and -PRON- be pretty_good and not as sweet
this be the good korean food in the valley
-PRON- absolutely_love the korean hot tofu soup here
the service be consistently great here even when the restaurant be busy
kelly always have a smile on -PRON- face and make_sure -PRON- have excellent service every_time
when travel through wisconsin madison and this particular shop be on the list because of the yelp_review
-PRON- be interesting how the review for fromagination would split between rave and meh
-PRON- have to go with the latter
the shop be cute as any posh little shop could be but definitely overpriced when -PRON- come to -PRON- cheese selection
in that variety_of everything and nothing -PRON- end_up leave to -PRON- next destination and leave a_few hundred dollar at brennan 's market
nice florist but extremely overpriced
-PRON- cost -PRON- $ 103 to have a dozen cream color rose deliver to downtown pittsburgh
-PRON- expect the arrangement to be beyond beautiful for that price
but -PRON- be not
in_fact by the second day the rose be already wilt
-PRON- feel pretty rip_off
exactly as describe a_bit_more upscale than cheesecake factory same theme
-PRON- have the chicken and waffle -PRON- be only ok
maybe -PRON- be just not a sucker for brand name
but -PRON- be so not impressed_with this_place
there be ton_of middle_of the aisle cart with vendor try to entice -PRON- to buy thing
the only one -PRON- may have stop for be the massage
-PRON- go into the hat store look for a_few special hat -PRON- have one i be look for and -PRON- seem over price so i do_not buy -PRON-
-PRON- also stop in a kitchen supply store and -PRON- be awesome but this be the only store that be awesome
if -PRON- need anything kitchenesque this be the place
other_than_that -PRON- leave shortly_after arrive
absolutely_amazing
-PRON- cry through the whole show
worth_every_penny
beautifully restore home into a coffee house
lots of nook and space to read
-PRON- be awesome
the only critique -PRON- have if that -PRON- should have large size of coffee available
-PRON- large be like most medium
hopefully -PRON- will expand to offer 20 and 24 oz coffee cup
other_than_that be be great
this_place seem_like a hidden little_gem
-PRON- enjoy this_place much more_than famous dave 's and lucille 's
price be great and the server seem to remember -PRON- and what -PRON- like
the devil egg be awesome and can_not go_wrong_with the 2 meat combo
the chicken be moist with a pink tint from the smoke
overall a great bbq joint
stumble_upon this gem while walk_in old montreal
the service be supreme owner and staff be kind patient and give -PRON- great rec on what to order
-PRON- highly_recommend the artichoke sandwich blueberry tea and nutella shortbread cookie
first download nowait app
-PRON- drive around the parking_lot for 15_minute look for parking
there be 11 people ahead of -PRON-
-PRON- be a beautiful setting

-PRON- sit_outside
light breeze no mosquito surprisingly
generous and frequent refill
-PRON- both order the fish sandwich
-PRON- be ok
the coleslaw be ok
the chip be good
the majority_of the menu be sandwich
-PRON- be nice to see local vendor cop out periogie use
the venue be the selling point
-PRON- be a nice place to enjoy the view and maybe catch a glimpse of henry the heron
pretty_cool place
-PRON- walk right in with no appointment and be able_to get a pedicure within a few_minute
the place be nice pretty big clean and the staff be friendly
probably will go_back again
thank lady
this be probably the bad show -PRON- have see in_vegas and -PRON- have see a lot_of -PRON-
-PRON- ask to have everyone fill out card with personal info on -PRON- that -PRON- would use in -PRON- act
everyone do fill -PRON- out and -PRON- forget to collect -PRON-
yet the show somehow go on use two people plant in the audience
those_who catch on to this blunder begin to quietly discuss what just happen
the staff quickly threaten to throw everyone out if -PRON- do_not shut up
aside_from this the mentalist mostly talk_about -PRON-
-PRON- even allude to the fact_that the hit tv series be inspire by -PRON- when in_fact -PRON- have a one hour tv special back in the 80_'s call the mentalist
even if the show be free do_not_waste -PRON- time
do_not recommend_this_place at all
after go to e.d. marshall 's jewelers to sell -PRON- 21 karat bracelet an emerald ring -PRON- have receive from molinas that be 6 karat total weight set in platinum and a lady presidential rolex that be 6 year_old -PRON- be offer a lousy $ 7700
-PRON- want to a very large shop in_phoenix who do a loan for $ 14,500
that be -PRON- first experience at e.d narshall jewelrs
and will be my last
do_not recoomend
this_place
at all
please read
this be hand_down the bad hotel experience -PRON- have ever have
the check in line be outrageous
-PRON- room be pay for by the organization -PRON- be attend a conference for but the resort_fee be tack on at the end cause -PRON- to pay out of pocket
which be not the bad thing in the world except for the room be horrible
-PRON- wreak of cigarette_smoke and -PRON- make -PRON- very worried about the cleanliness of the room
so -PRON- sleep on_top_of the comforter
-PRON- get bad there be a cockroach run_around the ice machine and for the grand finally literal poop water come up from the sink
cause the entire room to smell like sewer\/ fish tank
bottom_line that be disturb
when -PRON- call the front_desk -PRON- send someone to fix the problem but do_not offer to relocate -PRON- or anything
then -PRON- happen again as -PRON- be leave
overall just a horrible experience
ruin vegas for -PRON- -PRON- will_definitely need time to recover before return haha
-PRON- have decide to purchase a membership because of the caring staff and -PRON- ability to take_care_of -PRON- customer
-PRON- have have 4 massage from 3 different people and jessica have be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- have take the time to work on the area -PRON- ask -PRON- to
and -PRON- really_appreciate -PRON-
-PRON- staff make -PRON- comfortable every_time
get the og pearl milk_tea with boba
love -PRON-
but -PRON- be a little expensive compare to ca price
-PRON- decide to go here since there be not much to_choose_from wendy_'s be across from here but be not in the mood for -PRON-
the food be not anything exciting
-PRON- get the shrimp_taco
-PRON- do_not_care for the tortilla nor the rice
the shrimp be alright -PRON- just grill -PRON- no season at all
and the guacamole look very unappealing
overall -PRON- be disappointed in the quality of the food but the service be pretty_decent
-PRON- will preface this review to say -PRON- be christmas day and carl 's jr be the only_thing open
-PRON- have no other option and -PRON- have never be to this particular fast_food chain
the location be quite clean
that be why -PRON- get 2_star
the food be atrocious the people be ambivalent and the fry be greasy
-PRON- will save -PRON- all from -PRON- usual banter and witty remark
do_not go here unless -PRON- invest in pepto bismal
this studio have develop a reputation for be overly hot and -PRON- have to say that -PRON- deserve -PRON-
-PRON- have do bikram yoga off and on for 25 year
-PRON- be at the very first studio in_las_vegas and all the one that follow
-PRON- start practice in michigan and have also practice in chicago pasadena and studio city
this be the hot studio -PRON- have ever experience and -PRON- have be there many_time
-PRON- now practice at westside where the temperature be more in line with the publish recommend temp for bikram yoga which be around 105 degree
but the decatur\/wagon trail studio be very very often way over that
sometimes -PRON- walk_in the room and -PRON- be literally almost knock out by a wave of extreme heat
-PRON- have find that -PRON- practice do_not progress as fast in the severely extreme heat and -PRON- be difficult for -PRON- to avoid dehydration
at this studio -PRON- lose about 3 lb of water weight every class
that be ridiculous and just not necessary
however at westside -PRON- only lose about 1_lb
and -PRON- form and stamina improve much_more rapidly
the owner and instructor on decatur\/wagon trail just do_not seem to care that -PRON- go way over 105 all the time
-PRON- be actually a form of false advertising
-PRON- think there be a cadre of people_who like the temp at around 115 or even high and -PRON- cater to those people
frankly there seem to be more extreme type at this studio like more eat disorder type
because -PRON- have find that -PRON- progress so_much faster in just regular very hot rather_than burn hell hole hot -PRON- have stop go to this studio even while have some prepaid class leave
-PRON- can have -PRON- money
-PRON- be just not worth -PRON-
by the way the studio be indeed very clean and the smell be not as bad as other bikram studio
but for the record westside be also very clean and do_not smell that bad either
this firm be locally own and very responsive
-PRON- have use several window cleaner over the year and this firm be the good by_far
two young guy that work hard and do wonderful work
give -PRON- a try and -PRON- will not be disappoint
bad daddy 's be one of -PRON- favorite location for lunch or dinner
-PRON- have be several_time since -PRON- open in ballantyne and -PRON- have never be disappoint
the service be always great attentive and very informative
-PRON- have awesome daily_special burger and drink
on a friday or saturday the place be usually pretty packed and tonight be no different but -PRON- server ashley be fantastic
-PRON- be so attentive and helpful and make suggestion that be genuine and do_not feel sale y
-PRON- usually do the build -PRON- own salad but tonight -PRON- go with the cantina burger veggie and -PRON- be awesome
hubs always get the western burger buffalo and -PRON- swear buy -PRON-
juicy meaty and totally delicious
-PRON- favorite appetizer be the fry_pickle but tonight -PRON- try the homemade chip and pimento_cheese and -PRON- be also awesome
as -PRON- be pay the bill -PRON- server ashley ask if -PRON- would ever be in for breakfast and
-PRON- say -PRON- have not
-PRON- offer -PRON- a to go menu and tell -PRON- -PRON- should certainly check -PRON- out
and -PRON- be sure -PRON- will
-PRON- highly_recommend bad daddy be for a work lunch a lunch w\/friend or a night out with the family
great atmosphere excellent food and fantastic service
proud to call this franchise local and excited to see where -PRON- go
königsbau passagen tolle sache
viele läden
wunderbare innenansichten
trotz aller kritik
-PRON- be vorfeld ein recht gelungener bau
mein größter kritikpunkt ist die tiefgarage bzw
die kosten
w in stuttgart mit dem auto einkaufen will ist ein armer tropf
spätesten wenn er dort geparkt hat
13,20 für 6 stunden stellzeit ist nicht mehr angemessen
auch hi gilt die rendite muss stimman
sehr schade
so -PRON- would not normally drive all the way to cave creek for anything but -PRON- have the week off
-PRON- have to go to desert ridge and -PRON- see this_place in the phoenix magazine
needless_to_say save the gas
the place be cute on the inside and really have a lot_of promise
the side all sound good and -PRON- could_not decide between the pull_pork or the brisket
so -PRON- get both
add a side of potato_salad and a side of bean
where to begin
the pork be not bad
but -PRON- be not bbq
-PRON- mean -PRON- do_not taste smokey or sweet
-PRON- taste boil and that be nasty
-PRON- be fatty and generally just lack flavor
the bbq_sauce -PRON- put on the thing be decent
but -PRON- do_not have any of -PRON- out for -PRON- to get more
what -PRON- do have be regular and spicy bbq_sauce
both be thin both be a_bit spicy and neither be up to the task of fix this pork
the brisket be really a disaster
-PRON- be cut like ham slice
really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that -PRON- have to remove from each slice
this whittle -PRON- beef down to medallion sized bit
the taste be fine but the thick texture lack of bbq_sauce and fatty presentation be all disappointing
the bean be okay
but -PRON- expect sweet
bbq bake bean in -PRON- mind should be sweet and savory
these like everything_else here be just bland and dull
-PRON- try mix some of the runny bbq_sauce available
but -PRON- really do_not help
the saving grace be the potato_salad
this be some of the good stuff -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party
-PRON- should package -PRON- and sell -PRON- in the store
really -PRON- be creamy and sweet without overpower the potato flavor
good stuff and well execute
will not be go_back here
too_bad too because -PRON- have a lot_of promise
oh_well
there be no shortage of bbq in the valley
holy_crap -PRON- drink be crazy strong
-PRON- fancy -PRON- to be a_bit of a drinker
two drink from here
and -PRON- be waste
seriously
the location will throw -PRON- a_bit across from a gas_station but as_soon_as -PRON- walk_in -PRON- will know -PRON- be worth the trip
the decor be classic cheesy tiki and definitely make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- have leave vegas
a must visit bar
-PRON- be so_excited to learn that -PRON- favorite missouri hotspot -PRON- friend
and -PRON- always hang_out at be come to las_vegas especially around christmas
-PRON- own personal present
-PRON- be promptly disspoint once then twice again
the first_time -PRON- go
-PRON- have the mushroom burger and a chocolate shake
-PRON- must_say that the shake be awesome just like -PRON- remember the burger be absolutely awful
the amount_of grease be still a remembrance but -PRON- be think first week -PRON- will come_back after christmas to let -PRON- get settle in again -PRON- be very dissapoint the burger be very greasy and underseasoned again
-PRON- understand the burger be generally that way but -PRON- suppose to be in a good way
these be definitely not
-PRON- get the patty melt this time -PRON- fave and -PRON- be just awful no tasty steakburger patty or yummy cheese
but the shake be just as good though mint chocolate_chip although -PRON- get -PRON- way after -PRON- be do with -PRON- burger which be a bummer
the service here pretty_much suck too both time
-PRON- go
-PRON- forget -PRON- water to go with -PRON- shake and -PRON- ask for -PRON- twice the second_time -PRON- go
water be suppose to be pretty_much standard when -PRON- just have a shake but whatev
-PRON- try -PRON- twice
and -PRON- think that -PRON- will just go_back for the ice_cream if -PRON- want to wait in line
ugh
maybe the owner need to go_back to the midw and get some little midw welcome spirit and not the buffet crap food that la vegas be know for
visit -PRON- parent -PRON- decide to go here
now -PRON- live outside of santa rosa california about_an_hour and a half north of san_francisco
-PRON- can_not find any remotely decent asian restaurants\/market around here
-PRON- have everything filipino\/asian under the sun that any island boy or girl could want
this_place be awesome and -PRON- will make -PRON- a point to drop by here every_time -PRON- visit -PRON- parent
very cost effective light fast service but never once feel_rush
there be a wide_variety for the selection of food and everything that come to -PRON- table be cook_perfectly
the egg and -PRON- manage to feel_like a neighborhood diner and -PRON- family 's house all at the same time
no good place in_town for breakfast for both taste and value
be look for a nice restaurant to eat at that be near to vdara good but not super pricey
this_place fit the bill nicely
-PRON- have a 9:30pm reservation and be seat on time
the place be about 50 full
the service at the start be incredible but tapered off towards the end of the evening when -PRON- swap out waiter on -PRON-
wait staff however all very_knowledgeable about the wine and the food
-PRON- start with octopus which be delicious follow_by the lobster pici
the pici be very_nice indeed tasty and pretty rich
the pasta -PRON- be very dense and cook al_dente which take a little more effort to eat than perhaps -PRON- should have
-PRON- be a good size portion
-PRON- have a cheesecake for desert but at that point be too full to really_appreciate -PRON- be intricate flavor
-PRON- wife start with the lobster salad which be also excellent follow_by the branzino again delicious
modern décor with a chill yet sophisticated ambience
-PRON- wear a jacket but pretty_sure -PRON- could dine here in a t_shirt if -PRON- want to
-PRON- drop just over $_300 for the evening include a modestly price bottle_of white_wine
if this be not vegas -PRON- would say -PRON- be not worth that kind_of outlay
seem a little overpriced
but who know
last of the great salad_bar
all -PRON- can eat buffet of salad soup potato pizza pasta and soft_serve ice_cream
dig a_bit and find a coupon
-PRON- be not hard
cost be about $_10 each not include drink but water be free
good selection of item all fresh and hot or cold as need to be
the staff be great with offering to get -PRON- table beverage refill booster seat and salt and pepper
the manager jump up and run over when the two year_old flip -PRON- chair
-PRON- be nice to see -PRON- be watch -PRON- dining_room and be concern
great for lunch or dinner
leave a tip for the wait staff
-PRON- can access this_location by take the dunlap northbound frontage road for i17
thank_goodness someone tell the truth about fillaseat
all -PRON- have post on the site for las_vegas be comedy show
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- be even try to get good show sporting event and or concert to attend
-PRON- be kind_of irritated and feel_like -PRON- waste -PRON- money
what a disappointment
hear other competitor be the good deal if -PRON- be shop around
unless -PRON- like ton_of local comedian fillaseat may not be for -PRON-
hello hand pull noodle
definitely one of the good one -PRON- have ever have
think of -PRON- as al_dente noodle
firm chewy and cook just right
try the spicy beef noodle_soup
delicious broth crispy veggie tender beef awesome noodle
-PRON- can_not get any good
also try the green_onion pancake
-PRON- tasty but -PRON- sprinkle soy_sauce over -PRON- makin -PRON- extra salty at_least for -PRON-
order the pancake without the soy_sauce
the braised beef appetizer be yummy too
cash_only establishment

hand_down -PRON- favorite park
-PRON- love all the tall tree the green grass and the water area for kid to play
this park be huge
recommend -PRON- for workout and family party
this park have -PRON- all
skateboarding area basketball court volleyball tennis baseball dog park garden multiple kid playground -PRON- mean -PRON- have -PRON- all
possibly the bad airport food ever
grab a quick breakfast while wait to board -PRON- flight
-PRON- have the sausage biscuit and -PRON- be beyond dry
there be not enough ketchup on hand to give this thing
-PRON- call food any flavor and for what -PRON- charge vs a regular popeyes -PRON- disturbing
what a waste of money as for the customer_service the cashier be just plain rude with absolutely zero customer_service_skill -PRON- walk up to -PRON- say good morning and -PRON- totally blow -PRON- off and just say what do -PRON- want to order
no response as to -PRON- greeting the gal that hand the food to -PRON- be a lot friendly and even say have a great day if one be so miserable about the -PRON- job then quit and go_somewhere_else
preferably where -PRON- do_not deal with the public
grant airport food court be not the good but for what -PRON- charge -PRON- should try to improve the quality of food -PRON- serve and have good customer_service
imo
not the type_of guy that typically get this type_of service but -PRON- have be have dry skin issue and -PRON- girlfriend highly_recommend melissa at skintuition
overall great experience melissa explain_everything beforehand and ensure that -PRON- be comfortable in every way
the facility be quite nice and very_welcoming
the experience be relax and quite effective
if nothing else an important takeaway be that -PRON- need to take good care of -PRON- skin from sunscreen to hydration
melissa offer some great tip and offer a nice selection of product and the great thing no_pressure to buy -PRON-
this may not be a regular thing for -PRON- but -PRON- definitely trust that melissa know -PRON- stuff and would definitely use -PRON- service again
really nice little sit_down good beer_selection before -PRON- flight nice selection of mixed drink -PRON- will pay though as -PRON- be an airport venue and the salad -PRON- have be to die for
staff be friendly and cool
-PRON- love janky little family_own spot like this
the chocolate caramel prezel whatev will make -PRON- slap somebody
the price and portion be great
-PRON- only wish -PRON- have more\/better space for sit_down to enjoy the ice_cream
-PRON- seating area get pretty crowded
-PRON- be open
not_sure_why helper list -PRON- as closed
-PRON- eat_here on 5\/29\/17
sonic be one of those place -PRON- love to go
probably because -PRON- do_not exist where -PRON- live
-PRON- just love the novelty of the drive up
this one get extra star due_to the young_man who come by with a condiment cart
and offer extra packet of ketchup
-PRON- have be come to the tempe location for year but today be likely -PRON- last trip
-PRON- one year_old have a very severe sesame seed\/hummus allergy
-PRON- let the guy at the drive_thru know so that -PRON- could make_sure there be no cross contamination
-PRON- totally blow -PRON- off uhh
okay see -PRON- at the window
-PRON- do_not feel_like -PRON- hear -PRON- so when -PRON- get to the window -PRON- ask the gal if -PRON- note the sesame allergy as there have be mistake at other restaurant before and -PRON- have have severe allergy attack
the girl look_at -PRON- and say -PRON- do_not_know -PRON- food will be ready shortly and close the window
they literally
do_not_care
at all
-PRON- food be fine
but -PRON- totally blow -PRON- off which make -PRON- uneasy-
-PRON- be not fun for -PRON- to have to be extra cautious but -PRON- child could literally die from cross contamination
-PRON- seem_like -PRON- be in educate about the severity of food allergy
oh and -PRON- order -PRON- the oatmeal
but -PRON- be just a cup fill with milk and quinoa
-PRON- forget the oats and -PRON- be totally inedible so -PRON- have to throw -PRON- away
-PRON- be like quinoa soup
-PRON- be really irritated
see attach picture
good job on a boot repair
fast and do_not hesitate
many repair shop would not repair this because -PRON- not a guarantee fix
good work
-PRON- be fix
-PRON- have just receive the second incorrect order for the high_school soccer team
-PRON- place the original order over 6_month ago make -PRON- very clear that -PRON- want girl gear for -PRON- girl team
-PRON- be assure that -PRON- would send girl short despite the fact_that -PRON- have send -PRON- a mock up image on boy short
when receive -PRON- first incorrect order -PRON- send boys short and 2 set of shirt that be so short -PRON- could_not be tuck in unacceptable for soccer -PRON- take month to get the order redone
when -PRON- open the box today -PRON- have again send -PRON- the wrong short and only one set of shirt be able_to be tuck in
as a girl soccer coach and previous athlete -PRON- be wonder_if -PRON- work with girl team
be -PRON- negligence or lack of pride in -PRON- job
-PRON- have put -PRON- in a terrible position as -PRON- be an inner city low income public high_school and -PRON- season have already start
-PRON- spend_$ 2400 on this gear and have receive one team set of jersey that be what -PRON- order
-PRON- girl be not properly outfit and now universal be again unreachable
-PRON- will be request that -PRON- district stop use -PRON- as an approve vendor
-PRON- be offend and disappointed by the way -PRON- have treat the situation
food
typical for a bar menu
no reason to order a salad here
wing be above_average
fry be diet bust delicious cheese and bacon please
beer_selection excellent
if -PRON- be in the area for the long haul sign_up for the beer tour and get -PRON- name in light or more likely on a white board
bathrooms
one of two towel roll never work
-PRON- be magic
ambience
restaurant be consistently busy any night of the week probably due_to the lack of other thing to do in akron and the several nearby hotel
-PRON- recommendation come with a group
sit_at the bar
try the free popcorn and the breckenridge vanilla porter
side_note
will find steeler fan here on gameday
-PRON- have a terrible experience at this_place
the girl that work in the front be very_nice but not helpful
-PRON- dad bring -PRON- iphone 6s plus in to have -PRON- change out a crack screen
-PRON- get -PRON- phone back and the key pad be lag
so -PRON- bring -PRON- in again and the girl tell -PRON- -PRON- would be 35_minute to fix
so -PRON- leave and cam back an_hour later for -PRON- to tell -PRON- oh sorry
-PRON- do_not have -PRON- screen
-PRON- will have to come ack tomorrow
then the next_day same_thing be tell 30_minute come_back an_hour and a half later and the touch screen do_not work what so ever
-PRON- go_through 3 screen because all -PRON- screen be bad
then when -PRON- go home the keyboard once_again be act up
so -PRON- bring -PRON- to the owner to fix and -PRON- change the screen
-PRON- go to work and the camera no_longer work nor the speaker to hear people on a phone_call
so -PRON- call and -PRON- say -PRON- should have check before -PRON- leave and want -PRON- to go_back
so today -PRON- go_back politely -PRON- ask the girl in front for a refund
so -PRON- could get -PRON- phone properly fix because -PRON- clearly be not able_to do the job
-PRON- tell -PRON- to call the owner and -PRON- tell -PRON- sorry -PRON- do_not do refund because -PRON- do_not have -PRON- old screen to put back on the phone and also -PRON- check everything but -PRON- do_not leave -PRON- passcode
-PRON- in_fact do leave -PRON- code -PRON- just keep look for excuse and would not take the blame
then -PRON- text -PRON- which -PRON- will post because -PRON- would not answer -PRON- phone_call after -PRON- say -PRON- would call back and tell -PRON- -PRON- be abuse -PRON-
even -PRON- girl that work there be dumb found by -PRON- remark
-PRON- also say -PRON- have do more then enough for -PRON- which be a confusing statement see_how -PRON- cause all the issue besides the screen cracking
-PRON- have the guy fix -PRON-
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be because a wire be clip and -PRON- take 5 hour to fix -PRON- phone today
so because the owner be careless in fix -PRON- screen properly -PRON- have to go_back a total of 5 time

the show be very funny the cast be energetic the bartender be friendly the crowd be positive and there be good tune on after the show to encourage toe tap shoulder shift mingling
-PRON- be a solid 4-star experience-- what more could -PRON- ask for
that be when someone announce to the packed bar to head out for firework and the bartender offer to watch everyone 's drink
seriously
everyone crowd outside onto the tiny side street with a sense of occasion and cameraderie and a massively impressive and probably illegal but even the popo let these thing slide on holiday firework display erupt just foot from -PRON- nose
hand be clap whoop be holler and a wicked time be have by all
oh ya and -PRON- hand out coupon to come_back for another sunday_night live show fo free

-PRON- always have a hard time order at a mexican_restaurant since -PRON- be mexican
-PRON- have have -PRON- all
and -PRON- usually end_up eat the same_thing
lol
well -PRON- decide to stray from that this time
that do_not make -PRON- an easy decision tho
-PRON- see the same_thing -PRON- see at every other mexican place
-PRON- decide to look_at the appetizer
-PRON- order mexican pizza because -PRON- come with -PRON- house make chorizo on -PRON-
-PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- would be enough to fill -PRON- up
so -PRON- order the beef tostada
well the mexican pizza be good sized and delicious
but -PRON- want to at_least try the tostada while -PRON- be fresh
both be really good
the pizza be awesome
-PRON- will_definitely be back
-PRON- give the beer engine five_star this time because -PRON- do_not have to wait as long this time and -PRON- have something to compare -PRON- to
-PRON- still love the crazy huge beer_selection which alone get five_star
the burger and fish awesome as_usual
-PRON- love -PRON- corner table where -PRON- have plenty_of room to relax
towards 8:30\/9ish on a saturday the crowd get a little rowdy

the instructor be really nice and knowledgeable
the facility be a huge warehouse with different area for different trick
-PRON- try the fly trapeze and the trampoline
-PRON- really be a lot_of fun and -PRON- muscle get a workout
tsca be quite flexible pun intend
-PRON- offer class drop in and also party
if -PRON- be look to mix -PRON- up with -PRON- fitness routine give tsca a try
-PRON- stop_by for the first_time this_past_weekend and the staff be extremely_friendly and helpful
there be a great variety_of tea mainly blend as_well_as a lot_of tea accessory such_as cute pot cup strainer and tin
-PRON- do feel the pouchong oolong -PRON- buy be rather pricy the staff advise the price be high since each serve of oolong be good for 6 steeping but -PRON- barely squeeze 3 out of -PRON-
for high_quality oolong -PRON- have see good price elsewhere
so -PRON- will probably stick to -PRON- tea blend move_forward
otherwise -PRON- feel most of -PRON- pricing be very_reasonable
the level of customer_service be exemplary
the lady_who help -PRON- be more_than happy to take the vague direction of flavor -PRON- be look for and make suggestion on what to try
-PRON- throw -PRON- a request for dessert flavor and one of the recommendation -PRON- give lemon soufflé
be one -PRON- do_not expect to like but turn_out to be -PRON- favorite of the purchase that day
refills will_definitely be need

normally only get -PRON- blizzard fix through the drivethru but have go in on occasion
the employee be pretty nice and quick
only have one bad blizzard here as -PRON- think some of the piece have some ice or something on -PRON- as -PRON- have some crunchiness in -PRON- ice_cream which be not good but normally always good
favorite local spot hand_down
the food be excellent
service be great
band be awesome
come in to eat and stay for hour for the entertainment
decent beer_on_tap great service and mediocre everything_else
both burger -PRON- try have improper proportion of cheese to meat very little topping of interest and there be nothing_special about the meat-- -PRON- could_barely taste -PRON-
-PRON- have to be a darn good burger to charge_$ 12 with no side and that -PRON- be not
the website and online menu lead -PRON- to believe -PRON- be a much hipper young place
but the atmosphere be lack
-PRON- feel_like a stuffy dark place that old people would feel_comfortable in and -PRON- be mostly old people eat there
there be two server for the entire restaurant one of which be also the host and bartender
-PRON- be super_friendly compose and helpful
the water be room temperature which be a little untraditional for american dining
the music be awful drab and slow
nothing -PRON- try -PRON- would order again and -PRON- be definitely not go_back
bummer
this_place be an obvious puppy mill support store
there be several puppy there and -PRON- feel so bad for -PRON- because -PRON- go crazy as_soon_as -PRON- walk_in the door which make -PRON- seem as though -PRON- be attention deprive
-PRON- understand a certain amount_of noise should be expect at any place where pet be sell but this be excessive
there be three employee present but -PRON- be not very_helpful
-PRON- do have a large_selection of cutesy pet bed and collars\/leash treat and pet clothe but the noise level be so overwhelming -PRON- do_not want to linger
this store would be ideal for anyone_who want to purchase a designer dog on a whim and carry -PRON- around as an accessory with cute_little pink or baby blue toy without_any concern for the kind_of pet sale -PRON- be support
locate_in the concourse level of the hudson bay center this lcbo location be the close location to the bloor street east business district and the northern part of st. james town
same selection as other lcbo location however this_location be small than other -PRON- have be to
service be good even over the phone as -PRON- have call to get recommendation from -PRON- staff for wine and champagne
the ability to earn air miles for purchase over $_30 be a plus
just like another_reviewer -PRON- have also be wait for this_place to open and -PRON- finally do
-PRON- order a_few bulgogi meat the marinate shrimp and the seasonal vegetable
the angus prime brisket be the good -PRON- try
however the seasonal vegetable be not a good choice
-PRON- only contain half an onion some mushroom and some slice of zucchini
everything_else be great though
there be lot_of side_dish as_well
the price be fairly reasonable and the service be quite friendly so -PRON- will_definitely_come_back
very_limited seating
parking can be troublesome as -PRON- be on a narrow busy street
-PRON- have hear great thing_about -PRON- chicken on the rocks
and -PRON- be certainly not disappointed when -PRON- try -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- first order be without_any hot_sauce and -PRON- be delicious
come by a second_time and try -PRON- again with -PRON- high hotness level which include hot_sauce and powder
-PRON- can usually hold -PRON- spice but man one spoonful make -PRON- mouth burn
-PRON- take -PRON- a_few day to finish -PRON- since the hotness make -PRON- lose -PRON- appetite after a_few bite
-PRON- would not recommend anyone eat -PRON- with the high_level of spiciness
-PRON- really can_not taste any chicken garlic_sauce or rice at this level as -PRON- be basically eat spoonful of hot pepper
joes actually surprise -PRON-
-PRON- have be there once probably 10_year ago since -PRON- live in the far east_valley -PRON- do_not make the journey very much
stop into support -PRON- friend band arrive_early and sit_at the bar
joe super_friendly personalble and very chatty as -PRON- wait for -PRON- friend band to start
bartender get an a++ great personal service and -PRON- watch -PRON- deal with a couple of disgruntle customer about free refill on soda and see handle those boy like a champ
-PRON- better keep that one joe
set_up be -PRON- typical live_music venue sound be great nice big stage
cool place -PRON- only wish i live a_bit close
this_place have a vintage-70s retro feel to -PRON- on the inside
-PRON- be not run_down by any mean
-PRON- be in tip top shape and proud of -PRON-
-PRON- visit in april 2009 during -PRON- first trip to vegas
this be a nice place with a similar feel to the large neighborhood bar grill chain but more unique
the menu be huge like a bible
-PRON- think this would be a safe place for most folk
there should be something on the menu to please anyone
-PRON- just so happen -PRON- be not particularly pleased_with -PRON- meal but only because -PRON- take a risk on a entree -PRON- be not_sure about
if -PRON- be in_town again -PRON- will_definitely go_back to try_something_else
the menu consist_of 24-hr breakfast burger steak chicken etc
this be the good mexican_food -PRON- have have in a panaderia\/carniceria\/taqueria combination space with cartoon mural paint in arguably poor taste
ever
-PRON- reckon -PRON- be pretty authentic not that -PRON- be an authority
-PRON- make -PRON- want to take a vacation to a dusty mid sized colonial mexican town several hour from anything of note
and not that -PRON- be ungrateful or anything but -PRON- would love a vacation of any kind
maybe that be -PRON-
30 hour in_phoenix be nice and all but -PRON- could really use an_excuse to renew -PRON- passport
oh anyway
the food be incredibly tasty crispy in all the right way and be spicy enough to make -PRON- cry tear of joy
-PRON- go with a_few friend and sample the chilaquile tomal de queso con rajas fish_taco tostada de nopale a caramel fill churro -PRON- read that right the most amazing apple fritter -PRON- have ever have that -PRON- be pretty_sure la virgen be responsible for and that ridiculous hot_chocolate
with masa in -PRON- like there be not enough simple carb in mexican hot_chocolate
-PRON- be not dig the nopale and the fish_taco have a touch to much mayo
other_than_that -PRON- will refer to the aforementioned tear of joy
and do -PRON- mention that the bill for all this come to $ 21
perhaps -PRON- be related that -PRON- have such a cool cross section of people here
the menu be bilingual and so be the staff
the hot_chocolate be just gross but the drink be an acquire taste and -PRON- get the flavor right
-PRON- only get a star for the cajun fries
the burger be dry and tasteless
would not have eat the except for review of other people on_yelp
very_disappointed with -PRON- meal do_not_waste -PRON- time here
try the caveman burger or rehab burger therapy for delicious real hamburger
seriously do_not_waste -PRON- time at five guys
-PRON- go there with -PRON- friend for a summerlicious dinner on july 4 2009
the service be quite good keep -PRON- drink fill and be very courteous and -PRON- best -PRON- expectation
the food on the other_hand be quite pedestrian and sub_par
-PRON- have the niagara charcuterie plate as the appetizer and the meat be alright but the small slice of bread that come with the meal be rock hard
for the entree -PRON- have the house make ravioli with kobe_beef and -PRON- feel that -PRON- be entirely way_too little beef compare to the amount_of pasta there be
on the other_hand the part with the beef be quite tasty
finally for dessert -PRON- have the chai creme_brulee which be just average once_again nothing_special
overall -PRON- give -PRON- four_star for the excellent service that be quick and courteous and two_star for the very meh food for an average of three_star
-PRON- guess -PRON- should not expect such great food for summerlicious but -PRON- really be not all that great
clean and friendly
doctor dawn austin be super_friendly and very_helpful when -PRON- come to -PRON- question
great place to find more unusual spice from various part of the world
from ajwain seed to juniper berry -PRON- selection can_not be beat
for those that do_not want to make -PRON- own spice mix -PRON- also have pre_make spice mix that be mix base_on type_of cuisine and also base_on meat use
for those that want high_quality bake ingredient -PRON- also have multiple type_of extract and vanilla from various country
the price here be a little high_than buy in bulk at sprouts but the spice here be fresh and seem to be high in quality

-PRON- enjoy the stale bread and crudite(aka random vegetable both be beautifully serve
though -PRON- usually do_not eat a lot_of that sort_of preamble that most restaurant serve

the food be good
-PRON- start with scallop and pate
between the four of -PRON- -PRON- have rack of lamb lamb shank fillet mignon and assorted side
-PRON- also have a bottle_of wine
all excellent total bill with tip $ 340
good service be vital to the survival of these type_of place
-PRON- can honestly say that good service be what -PRON- will get at_this_location
from the pricing to the promptness of be see the care and knowledge of the care provider and true concern for the patient
if -PRON- need to be see by someone other_than -PRON- regular care provider or just do_not have a regular provider -PRON- do_not think -PRON- will be disappoint here

the guy just could_not get -PRON- tv repair even_though -PRON- claim to be do this for over thirty year
-PRON- take -PRON- tv and have never call -PRON- back about -PRON- -PRON- be be almost a month since -PRON- take -PRON- tv

and -PRON- do_not_know which tv be mine
-PRON- have to point -PRON- out
the screen be break and -PRON- try to tell -PRON- -PRON- be already like that

the big steer at the front_door well ok
the big slide down to the next level well ok
the view of the city
now -PRON- get something
-PRON- date and -PRON- have the rattlesnake bit
-PRON- could make this -PRON- main meal
the rest_of the food be institutional style with no attempt of any elegance whatsoever
picture golden corral upscale
one and do no reason to go_back
-PRON- really want to love this hole_in the wall with good beer
the bartender be really nice but the immediate smell of urine would not leave -PRON- alone
the place literally stink
-PRON- understand this be a dive_bar but seriously have a little pride
whomever own this_place obviously do_not_care
-PRON- give -PRON- a chance and at_least finish -PRON- first beer
no person serve food or drink should ever blow -PRON- nose twice into a napkin and serve drink without wash -PRON- hand
-PRON- leave after the first beer which be tasty
plus one_star
if -PRON- visit this bar when this be post and have a cold thank the bartender
-PRON- have an_awesome birthday experience here
the service be great
-PRON- have the yaki soba which be a very tasteful vegetarian dish
-PRON- will_definitely be return
sadly -PRON- get_rid_of the shishito pepper
hence the miss star
great place though remodel look awesome
raman be very good probabky good in downtown but yaki soba be by_far -PRON- favorite dish
the brunch be great
-PRON- get the bacon steak and egg meal
this be a whole bunch_of flavor that mix really well together
the bloody_mary be great and the staff be awesome definitely go and try this_place out
-PRON- foodie friend insist -PRON- try this_place and have be talk_about -PRON- for a very long_time
-PRON- go today
-PRON- have to park in the back which be surround_by an unsavory residential area
so parking be -PRON- first concern
the restaurant inside be quaint and nice
for such a highly acclaim restaurant -PRON- be not at all impressed_with the service
-PRON- be not greet
since -PRON- be meet -PRON- friend -PRON- decide to just look around -PRON-
-PRON- understand that this be not an on the border or traditional mexican_food as_soon_as -PRON- open the menu
unfortunately that be the kind_of mexican_food that -PRON- like
no chip and salsa
be not that a staple at any mexican_restaurant
-PRON- serve bread which be not even good
very basic bread like what -PRON- could purchase at basha 's and some type_of chili\/tomatoe spread
-PRON- skip that
-PRON- order guacamole which be awesome
too_bad the chip -PRON- serve be so dry and bland
again in -PRON- opinion the guacamole would have be so_much good on the thin salty chip that -PRON- be use to
-PRON- be starve
so -PRON- decide to get adventurous and order something that sound somewhat familiar
-PRON- order what -PRON- think would be a simple chicken enchilada
-PRON- be a mole sauce which -PRON- have never try before
not a fan
-PRON- have just a couple bite
this mexican bitter chocolate sauce have no place on food at all but -PRON- have hear a lot_of great thing_about -PRON-
so maybe -PRON- be just -PRON- personal taste
-PRON- friend 's pull_pork be delicious have a couple bite of that
-PRON- have obviously realize by now that this be mexico city type food and not traditional bean and rice chip and salsa type food
the meal be serve with a side of very soggy vegetable again not typical vegetable that -PRON- would even want to eat so -PRON- do_not understand that either
be this a side
be -PRON- a garnish
be this creative
what the f -PRON- be hungry
-PRON- have a bite of what -PRON- think be zuchini
-PRON- be almost like -PRON- be soak in oil and steam
-PRON- would have love to have spot and good yet taste anywhere in anything -PRON- order some cilantro some green_onion but no such luck
again -PRON- realize that a lot_of people probably love this restaurant
just put -PRON- review out there to help those_who have not be be aware of what kind_of experience -PRON- may have
-PRON- would never go there again
-PRON- come_here for lunch with five other friend
-PRON- want to try the bento_box because -PRON- love bento_box and -PRON- have hear some buzz about -PRON-
but after eat some of mine and see what -PRON- friend be eat -PRON- really regret -PRON-
everything be greasy even the rice
-PRON- scoop -PRON- rice to the side of the box to strain some of the grease
yes -PRON- be that bad
-PRON- could_not finish -PRON-
-PRON- friend have the salad_bar a cobb salad vegan burger and flat bread sandwich 5th friend also have a bento_box
the springs cafe be all about healthy eating and natural food so -PRON- should have order something of that standard
-PRON- want to go_back because -PRON- dining companion 's lunch look sooo good but -PRON- definitely will_never order another bento_box
there be waiter but the service be similar to a buffet restaurant where -PRON- pay for what -PRON- want first get -PRON- beverage cup and seat -PRON-
there server who deliver -PRON- food and check on -PRON- a couple of time be very_nice and professional
for what -PRON- be -PRON- be great
a gourmet style take out market with eat in dining_area and bistro
-PRON- love the look and feel of the market
-PRON- remind -PRON- of dean and deluca in nyc
the one in soho
-PRON- order a malke -PRON- own salad at the salad_bar and a sushi_roll
-PRON- be die to try -PRON- sushi
so -PRON- order both and take some to go
the salad_bar be great -PRON- order ton_of veggie some cheese a hard boil egg and a piece_of grill_chicken
-PRON- be $_8
-PRON- think a fair_price for a huge ass salad
the sushi on the other_hand be mediocre
-PRON- order a spicy_tuna_roll and well -PRON- will not be get sushi there again
the fish be fresh although the rice be not right
-PRON- would say the sashimi would be a good bet
the do carry -PRON- favorite water from tuscany acqua panna although -PRON- seem a_bit pricing at $ 1.75 for the 16.9 oz bottle
either_way -PRON- recommend check_out dish
-PRON- think -PRON- will agree -PRON- be a diamond in the rough
really unique sophisticated atmosphere
the restaurant serve spicy jamaican cuisine and lot_of rum
-PRON- order an_appetizer of calamari but -PRON- be not the deep_fry version rather -PRON- be just grill squid with a fruity\/floral sauce
the appetizer have win a_few award and -PRON- know_why
squid usually have a rubber like texture but the appetizer -PRON- have just melt_in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- be definitely pricey for the amount -PRON- get but worth the experience of fresh squid at -PRON- fine
-PRON- order the pull_pork over polenta
-PRON- be not a fan_of how smokey the pork be but the meat -PRON- be very tender
there be way_too_much sauce pour over the polenta which make a weird texture but would have be great with out -PRON-
-PRON- husband order a tropical fish dish which be excellent
-PRON- will_definitely try this_place again
be not a fan_of -PRON- dish but look_forward_to try_something_else on the menu
all -PRON- have to say for justification for -PRON- 3-star rating though -PRON- will say more be that -PRON- see a stain forever 21 shirt for $_11
ummmmmmm
-PRON- could go to forever 21 and buy a new shirt without mascara stain on -PRON- for the same price
also -PRON- package halloween costume be literally the same price as new
-PRON- have be to buffalo exchange in several state and -PRON- always seem to have decent luck on find thing
one time in another state -PRON- buy this old old fur hat make in italy for $_18
a steal
this time -PRON- buy a betsey johnson dress for $_30 which be a heck of a deal consider the aforementioned stain forever 21 shirt
buffalo exchange in -PRON- experience have a lot_of actual vintage versus old made in china h&m crap from two year_ago
-PRON- have never try to sell anything i'd probably have good_luck at trend traders down the road in get -PRON- money 's worth
-PRON- be pretty excite come_here because of all the great review but
this must of be a bad day for -PRON-
-PRON- be a sunday_afternoon and only another couple in the place and the food take_forever
also the grill_cheese be a mess
-PRON- can_not mess_up grill_cheese
not happy right but will give -PRON- another_chance again in the future
-PRON- be not_sure what all the hype be about with this_place
maybe -PRON- just come at an off time
come with -PRON- dad for happy_hour and sit_at the bar
bartender be not have the good of day previous bartender leave the place a mess and not ready for the night shift
so -PRON- get the frustration
but -PRON- just keep huff and puff about -PRON- and be snappy with anyone and everyone ask for drink
restaurant set_up and vibe be a little tacky in -PRON- opinion
giant girl with dia de muertos face or giant face of celebrity just be not -PRON- cup of tea to look_at while eat
-PRON- do have a nice patio
chips and salsa
-PRON- only think -PRON- be okay -PRON- do_not get the raving review
the chip be thin crispy and salty but the salsa be meh have some flavor but there be not even a_bit of spice -PRON- call salsa not pulse bland tomato
and -PRON- only one salsa -PRON- do_not have a second or back up salsa maybe a spicy option
for a mexican_restaurant -PRON- find that weird
but -PRON- love spice
and -PRON- know some people do_not
so -PRON- good plain salsa
happy_hour chicken taco and fish be tasty
good flavor small but good
if that_s the size of the regular taco for $_17 then that_s a joke
price seem a little_steep for what -PRON- be get
5star for sure
-PRON- have so_much respect for the owner for open this_place
-PRON- awsome
cute_little health wealth fast_food spot
great vibe in here
-PRON- like the chickpea salad broccoli stirfry
can_not forget to get dessert the macroon be delish
-PRON- need place like this everywhere
and in -PRON- opinion -PRON- not overprice at all
for 11 $ -PRON- get a big plate of raw nutritional delicious food
-PRON- family need a new washer dryer
-PRON- do a ton_of research before decide on best buy
good buy offer free delivery free set_up of the new unit+ take away of the old if -PRON- mention that -PRON- be just at lowes-
-PRON- do_not_know_why just tell -PRON-
-PRON- be save $_100 + on that alone compare to sears and home depot
the washer and dryer be on sale -PRON- even have the old model -PRON- opt_for the new and -PRON- price match
the staff be friendly and attentive
-PRON- know -PRON- stuff be patient with -PRON- family and get -PRON- in and out quick
what a find
thank -PRON- yelp
-PRON- come_here for breakfast a week or so ago for the first_time and -PRON- oh_my
-PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- husband could tell -PRON- be good because -PRON- actually eat all of -PRON- scramble_egg
and -PRON- rarely do that
-PRON- husband order the chicken fry_steak
-PRON- hand bread this here
and -PRON- say -PRON- be phenomenal
everything about -PRON- breakfast be great from start to finish
this_place be tiny and in a little strip_mall next to a dog grooming salon
-PRON- will_definitely be back
so when -PRON- party and -PRON- arrive here -PRON- notice how tiny the place be not a bad thing just a little advice to those_who have not be here do_not bring a party of 6 + because this_place be too tiny for that
however -PRON- be a cute_little place
-PRON- be greet with smile by the owner and -PRON- daughter who be the spittin image of -PRON- mom and be thoroughly explain the menu
the owner give -PRON- some pastry on the house to try a bear claw which be delicious
-PRON- have the breakfast sandwich and -PRON- husband have the breakfast_burrito
-PRON- egg sandwich be really good and the bread be delicious however -PRON- husband be not impressed_with -PRON- burrito
-PRON- even try a bite and be not impressed
overall this be a cute_little family run place with great pastry and good breakfast but be just a little too_much of a drive for -PRON- to make a second trip
carpet be disgusting-
-PRON- have to replace -PRON- like now
so gross-
-PRON- be in 16101
and -PRON- be low level
so -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be in a basement-
the 2 bedroom and 2 bath be great and -PRON- need those be with a whole family-
the pool could have be cold
but -PRON- be never crowd which be great- -PRON- ask to exchange towel and get the new one right_away
but -PRON- take day to pick_up the old ones(in fact -PRON- never do even_though -PRON- call about that 4x-
-PRON- be cheap and the shuttle be good except -PRON- would be nice to come more_often and later at night-
-PRON- mean this be vegas-
but the driver be all really nice front_desk_staff be polite first_time in a condo in_vegas
and -PRON- would do -PRON- again
but not here unless -PRON- had to~~~~~~~ parking be great- bed be comfy and the shower be really nice-
but the carpet just ruin everything -PRON- be so nasty
the food be great
-PRON- be strikingly fresh
as if the be pound out the tomato just before -PRON- arrive to make the sauce
the only_thing be location -PRON- be so_far off the beaten path -PRON- have to be a not only local but neighborhood local or yelper to know about this_place
now that -PRON- think about -PRON- that be the only_reason -PRON- have not be back
fix that soon soon
-PRON- just find this_place and have be here 3 time for lunch in the last_week
-PRON- think -PRON- be a wonderful concept and very fairly price
-PRON- favorite be the bbq ranch as a wrap the southwest cesar and the cobb all be five_star in the world of fast_food
-PRON- also try the asian and the mixed greens and apples which -PRON- enjoy but find -PRON- a little light and less filling
the lemonade and the kale smoothie be also noteworthy
-PRON- recently_move and need window clean inside and out for the house in somewhat short order
c3 respond quickly and professionally
-PRON- even come_out on a saturday
-PRON- be not_sure about pricing but to -PRON- -PRON- seem reasonable and the pricing be consistent with or good_than other quote -PRON- receive
-PRON- neighbor compliment the window after -PRON- be finish with word like sparkling
all in all
-PRON- would definitely use -PRON- again and -PRON- highly_recommend c3 window cleaning
-PRON- actualy like this_place
very lokey
strip accesible
-PRON- not the good ooking place on the outside
-PRON- guess -PRON- have be bless to have book newly renovate room
never have any problem with service
the first stay however be tricky
no where do -PRON- mention resort_fee
and -PRON- even call to ask about hidden fee or anything extra other_than amount email on -PRON- receipt
-PRON- be assure there be not any
upon_arrival -PRON- be charge resort_fee
aside_from that -PRON- dony like that this hotel be all smoke free
come from northern california -PRON- long for the type_of pho that a_few hybrid restaurant serve up a combination of pho and a wonderful chinese broth the base of which be pork grind
difficult to find here but
pho tan thanh serve -PRON- up in grand style
18 on the menu
absolutely superb
and -PRON- look_forward_to -PRON- every sunday as a treat prior to buy -PRON- chinese broccoli at leelee adjacent to the restaurant
-PRON- find the service to be excellent and friendly and highly_recommend especially if -PRON- order the 18
enjoy
-PRON- go to the bon qui qui show
-PRON- be great but this review be about the theatre
-PRON- park in a parking_garage and only pay_$ 6 for parking
as_soon_as -PRON- walk_in there be usher ask everyone if -PRON- need help and guide just about every person
-PRON- be vip and -PRON- have to say besides front row seat and meet and greet there be nothing more
no nice seat or drink
-PRON- do have about 6 mobile bar thingie where -PRON- could buy liquor
that be cool
staff be extremely_friendly organized and professional
the stage be a decent size great lighting and big_screen
definitely_recommend
-PRON- have be mean to come_here for month now and finally make -PRON- in
so_glad -PRON- do
-PRON- be extremely helpful and so nice
the price here be worth pop in for sure
-PRON- have a great selection of grain free food and lot_of toy
delicious
now -PRON- understand_why -PRON- be always so busy
great food friendly service super_cute patio
-PRON- have the pancake flight and -PRON- change -PRON- life
this be not a good subway
-PRON- be just there
-PRON- get a tuna sandwich
-PRON- be disgusting
-PRON- ask for -PRON- to be toast -PRON- toast -PRON- with the veggie in -PRON-
who do that
-PRON- go to the drive_through
-PRON- wait like 15_minute
-PRON- would not recommend this_location
small cafe inside the wynn hotel
-PRON- wait in line then order and pay when -PRON- be -PRON- turn
the staff be friendly and quick with -PRON- service
one mid morning -PRON- decide to get some food here
-PRON- order the asian chicken salad $ 9.95 and -PRON- come with the asian dressing inside the to go container
-PRON- also get a bagel with cream_cheese a fruit cup and an oj after -PRON- order -PRON- wait by the counter for -PRON- food then find an open table to sit and eat
-PRON- asian chicken salad be very good
-PRON- be a good size portion for the money
and -PRON- really_enjoy the dressing for the salad
the oj and fruit cup be very good as_well
if -PRON- need something quick in the morning try the cafe at the wynn
xie xie
-PRON- order the spicy pork
the flavor of the sauce be good and the meat be cook well but -PRON- be also very stringy and fatty
overall the food be mediocre
the food price be too high for the quality offer
however the portion_size be quite large so there should be leftover for extra meal
-PRON- service be terrible
the server would not look in -PRON- direction for 20_minute at a time
-PRON- do_not once visit during the meal
-PRON- bring two dish out 10_minute_before the other and bring one person 's food out 15_minute after everyone_else have -PRON- food
-PRON- have trouble pay since -PRON- would ignore -PRON- and wipe_down an adjacent empty table even_though -PRON- be clearly wave and yell to -PRON-
the combination of terrible service average food and high price ensure that -PRON- will not return
this be not what -PRON- would call a good hole_in the wall korean shop
menu have very few korean dish and an even small selection of meat
not bad decent value look ghetto but do_not let that get to -PRON-
walk_into this_place about a year_ago to try -PRON- out
and -PRON- have be back just about every_week since
-PRON- can_not get enough of the beef pho
and -PRON- be addicted to -PRON- steam pork dumpling
-PRON- will also smash a bahn mi sandwich once in a while another solid menu_item
not only be the food excellent here but the service be always on point
the family that run the place be so friendly -PRON- can tell -PRON- work really hard to maintain a clean restaurant and genuinely make everyone feel_welcome
the food always come_out quick and hot and the quality be consistent
-PRON- be in a little strip_mall tuck_away behind an arby 's
-PRON- think if this_place be locate_in a more visible location -PRON- would be pack all the time
go give this_place a chance -PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- go to restaurant when -PRON- want a healthy vegan meal with real flavor
everything from the big wac to the mongolian bowl have be delicious
and since -PRON- be all pretty healthy -PRON- can head next_door to get a tsoynami afterwards
totally guilt free delicious food
the most friendly_staff -PRON- have come_across in any kind_of doctor office
not to mention the doctor be awesome as_well
the dr. blanton be the owner
-PRON- be very hand on and explain_everything in detail
-PRON- be very happy that -PRON- find this office
-PRON- have want a nose piercing and tattoo for as long as -PRON- could remember
so -PRON- do -PRON- research
imo a tattoo and a piercing be not something -PRON- get with out look -PRON- well a tattoo more
-PRON- finally decide on club tattoo
-PRON- get -PRON- nose pierce in september of 2009
the piercer be very_professional put on glove and a mask over -PRON- mouth
all the equipment be sterile and -PRON- make_sure -PRON- put -PRON- purse where -PRON- would not make the sterile field dirty
very fast -PRON- do_not even feel -PRON- be do
-PRON- give -PRON- write care instruction and -PRON- buy of can of clean solution
all the jewelry for piercing be display in a well light case in the front of the store
when -PRON- return to buy different ring for -PRON- nose -PRON- have on glove as -PRON- remove -PRON- from the case
in december -PRON- come_back to get -PRON- first tattoo
-PRON- have consult with the artist and be give a price and time estimate of how long -PRON- would take
when -PRON- be able_to -PRON- come and put a down a small payment and make_an_appointment
when -PRON- come in to get -PRON- tattoo -PRON- take -PRON- right in
prepp -PRON- and put the outline on -PRON-
from the time -PRON- get there to when -PRON- pay be less_than an_hour and fifteen_minute
less_than time -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would take to actually get the tattoo
-PRON- artist be lindsey -PRON- be very fast but -PRON- tattoo look amazing
from what -PRON- get from talk to other people this shop be more expensive
but -PRON- be true believer -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
and a tattoo be something -PRON- will have on -PRON- for the rest_of -PRON- life so -PRON- would pay any amount to make_sure -PRON- look great and be do by artist who know_how to do -PRON- work well
-PRON- have go to other shop and -PRON- know as_soon_as -PRON- walk -PRON- would not return
one shop -PRON- walk_into smell of cigarette_smoke and -PRON- have coffee cup everywhere
the private room when get a tattoo be a huge plus
club tattoo be always spotless and the staff be very_professional
-PRON- come in after church on a sunday_afternoon
-PRON- the same concept as pieology make -PRON- own pizza to order
choose the pre suggest pizza or make -PRON- own selection
-PRON- kid be excite to choose -PRON- own crazy wish and when -PRON- come to -PRON-
-PRON- choose the same way
-PRON- do_not see an option for gluten_free pizza crust but -PRON- be distract cuz of the amount_of choice
-PRON- have rack on the wall of premade pizza dough smaller 4-slic for the kid and large 4-slic for adult
-PRON- choose -PRON- sauce topping and the creation go into the large pizza oven
-PRON- friend order a pre suggest pizza and unfortunately the young_man and middle_aged lady do_not remember all the topping that go with that specific pizza
-PRON- could hear the guy read off the list to the lady_who be make -PRON-
kinda tacky guy
also -PRON- ask -PRON- name for the pizza and -PRON- hear something completely different
like if -PRON- be suppose to be jeff
-PRON- write barb on -PRON-
-PRON- try to correct -PRON-
and -PRON- say
oh that_s ok
right
then why ask -PRON- name
the pizza be quick to cook and have a good flavor
-PRON- have alot of topping fall_off -PRON- pizza
but -PRON- really do_not look very loaded
strange
-PRON- have a nice patio and the place feel comfy
-PRON- be not_sure -PRON- will come_back
-PRON- would be concern -PRON- forget to refrigerate something properly or wash -PRON- hand
just say
barney fife would be proud of these_guy
the lpd 's sole purpose for exist be to fund the city 's coffer
there be a 400-yard stretch of i-71 that lpd illegally patrol vigilantly
anybody drive_through here can tell when linndale be approach base_on the brake light that be see as_soon_as -PRON- enter the village
-PRON- have be feature on the local and national news multiple_time for the overzealous ticketing -PRON- illegal tactic -PRON- hypocrisy and how far -PRON- be willing_to go to defend -PRON- practice in court
-PRON- will ticket -PRON- if -PRON- run a yellow light stop -PRON- car two inch in front of a white line at a traffic signal or a stop sign
speeding anything over the speed limit be a certain ticket do a rolling stop or a rolling right on red
-PRON- be not as corrupt as new rome be but -PRON- be right up there for the title of worst police department in the state
and no -PRON- have not get ticket there
good location ever
-PRON- love love love the manager jess
-PRON- be super great and always helpful
-PRON- always help -PRON- find what -PRON- be look for and have the good suggestion for gift
-PRON- will drive the half_hour out of the way to go to this_location
just a beautiful park lake directly link to several more beautiful park lake
very serene yet -PRON- feel safe
wonder walking bike path
-PRON- be from minneapolis mn -PRON- never think -PRON- would find anywhere remotely close to the beautiful lake park within the city of minneapolis where there be a myriad of beautiful walking run biking path
but -PRON- do here in az- of all place
the ground be exceptionally clean well keep up
5_star
great menu
the guiness pot roast be the good
great atmosphere and service as_well
-PRON- have eat breakfast twice at the place
first_time breakfast burro burrito be so moist could_not hold in hand however the waffle be ok
second_time eggs benedict be more like eggs hollandaise soup and the huevos be terrible
both of -PRON- have indigestion for the rest_of the day
usually -PRON- give a new restaurant three strike the place earn three strike in two visit
on a positive note the wait staff be good even_though -PRON- have to wait 10_minute_before have -PRON- order take on second_visit
have high hope for the place since the breakfast joynt move
good_luck
-PRON- be a shame the review be so lousy but here be -PRON- take on -PRON-
-PRON- be not very organized
-PRON- be new enough that this do_not bother -PRON- and -PRON- own a restaurant so there be thing -PRON- be relaxed about that prior to be in business -PRON- would have be very upset about
here be the negative thing take way_too long to get to the table even the bill can take 20_minute but -PRON- hope a couple month and this will get work out
staff be friendly but either over work or disorganized
the music be wayyyyyy to loud
-PRON- be hard to talk without yell
-PRON- know this seem to be the new thing
and -PRON- make a place seem busy even when -PRON- be not but -PRON- drive -PRON- nut this be about only_thing that will keep -PRON- from eat there every_week or two
the other thing -PRON- do_not like which have nothing to do with -PRON- dining_experience be the form contact response with email address to a bad review
-PRON- empower all of -PRON- staff to comp give out sample whatev -PRON- need to to make customer happy
this make -PRON- feel good about -PRON- job too because -PRON- no -PRON- can make decision at work without have to talk with a supervisor just a suggestion
also -PRON- be smooth because when someone get upset -PRON- get fix right then and there
if -PRON- do_not like how -PRON- handle -PRON- -PRON- discuss alternative later but let -PRON- make choice at the time
positive and why -PRON- will go_back
the food be excellent
-PRON- could_not pick on the sauce for the short_rib be too_salty but otherwise -PRON- have a large_group with a lot_of thing to try and everything be very good
good chinese in cu by_far
be recommend by a chinese friend as the place to go and -PRON- be not disappoint by the food
-PRON- recently add waitstaff to -PRON- payroll which seem to detract from the experience as the table service be weak and -PRON- wait a very long_time for -PRON- check
this_place hand_down be nasty
-PRON- have to be ask 4 time what do -PRON- order
and when -PRON- finally get -PRON- -PRON- be not even wrap all the way closed
and -PRON- just throw -PRON- in a bag
the chicken -PRON- be so nasty burn and taste old
the guy on the front line be rude and all over the place -PRON- be way to loud in there
and -PRON- be more like a playground then a restaurant
go to audi chandler this morning to test_drive an a3
spend a_bit of time on the lot browse vehicle and no salesperson come_out to greet -PRON-
very_disappointing as -PRON- have experience as a car salesperson and would have go out to greet any potential customer
as -PRON- be leave -PRON- see a salesperson with another customer and tell -PRON- that -PRON- have come to buy but decide to leave instead
go to a bmw dealership and a salesperson come_out within a few_minute and -PRON- be test_drive a 320i soon after
the only_reason -PRON- do_not buy from -PRON- be because -PRON- do_not have the color combination -PRON- be after
this be such a great place for great food
-PRON- just wish the place be a little big
-PRON- be an executive assistant in san_francisco

but seriously i can_not complain i be treat very_nice by the staff and manager because i have work with -PRON- in the past and -PRON- be more_than cool and down to earth
only_downside aside_from the basic bro element associate with all do be no designate bike locking area but after see_how many bike be there that night hopefully -PRON- will get a set_up
for -PRON- price and for what -PRON- be a casual italian restaurant -PRON- be pretty_good
not too_expensive -PRON- do_not_know_what other people think but -PRON- be from la and $ 10-$15 a plate be a pretty_good deal and the pizza be not exceptional but definitely tasty

jd 's be awesome about go_through everything with a fine tooth comb and ensure -PRON- be catch_up on everything go_back several year and two other state
efficient thorough and professional
if -PRON- be in henderson and do_not want to drive 10 mile to chinatown area then check_out china a go go
-PRON- be pretty_darn good and about_10 level high in quality than panda 1
ambiance locate_in a strip_mall with easy_parking and fighting for -PRON- food attention with a coffee shop and a sandwich shop near by
-PRON- can smell the chinese cooking and -PRON- get be -PRON- olfactory sens go
inside the restaurant be small a_few table and quite crowded if there be people wait in line

food
the quality of food here be quite good
a. beef chow_fun dry
one of -PRON- favorite food or comfort_food as -PRON- grandmother and mom always make this for -PRON- grow_up
-PRON- like the fact_that this dish not only have al_dente noodle -PRON- do_not fill_up the dish with carrot and celery
veggie be important to the texture and the taste of the overall dish yet use carrot and celery actually take_away_from the taste of the dish vs. add to the flavor
here -PRON- use green_onion onion bean_sprout
very_nice
b.
chicken curry
the flavor of the curry be a_bit spicy not too hot just enough to get -PRON- juice kick
-PRON- will not need to grab lot or water so rather -PRON- be a nice taste and flavor
-PRON- be unfortunate that due_to mostly western palate that -PRON- use chicken_breast instead_of chicken on the bone
the flavor of chicken on the bone be far_superior to chicken_breast
however -PRON- do slice the breast just right and flash cook -PRON- at the right speed
so -PRON- be quite tender and juicy
c.
spring bean with chicken love the flavor of the black_bean mix with this dish
the spring bean be cook to perfection and the chicken be flavorful and tender
d.
rice -PRON- give -PRON- plenty_of rice with -PRON- dish
e.
overall all the food here be focus_on western taste yet all the cook be chinese short order cook or so appear to be and yap away in chinese
the cook be all visible as -PRON- enter so -PRON- can see everything
-PRON- do cater here and pan sized dish so this be great for party
-PRON- do_not vary much on what -PRON- order from here because the menu be mostly western food and not what -PRON- normally order
however for what -PRON- do order -PRON- be great
-PRON- say check -PRON- out
-PRON- can_not go_wrong
this_place be like go to inn and out for a burger vs. mcdonalds
-PRON- seem_like all the bad review about this_place be about the service and be very deserving
-PRON- always seem very disorganized nobody seem to care and everything about the the layout be confusing
food be decent but everything_else fall short if -PRON- choose anywhere_else to eat in the area -PRON- will not be disappoint
hate nothing
dislike nothing
like friendly attentive server
clean and more modern aesthetic than_most pho restaurant
good pho broth
dessert option
love
some of the pho side be serve separately so -PRON- do_not shortchange the actual amount_of broth and noodle
open til 2_a.m.
good eats+ good service + good company = perfection
this review be long_overdue as the mister and -PRON- treat -PRON- to a nice dinner for valentine_'s_day this past year
better late than never right
-PRON- decide to try a spot that have be on -PRON- list for ages
michaelangelo 's a fine establishment just across the street from -PRON- have receive rave_review since -PRON- open -PRON- door in 2006
in_fact last_year the restaurant be zagat rated review highlight
this romantic retreat offer authentic northern italian cuisine from chef\/co owner michael annandoro along_with an extensive selection of wine and a stylish bar_area
with a large fireplace for winter and a patio for warm weather -PRON- an ideal choice for a special night out
-PRON- start with the house multi grain bread and flavor olive_oil
-PRON- order -PRON- go to italian appetizer which be normally any dish that include mozzarella and prosciutto
as_soon_as -PRON- spot the bufala -PRON- know -PRON- have to have -PRON-
describe on the menu as buffalo mozzarella prosciutto di parma and roasted red_pepper this dish be the perfect way to kick off -PRON- dinner
the mozzarella be rich creamy and a great match for the salty prosciutto
know that -PRON- would be order an indulgent treat -PRON- think -PRON- would be good to order something light
but light and healthy do_not mean flavorless no siree
this simple arugula salad be pack with incredible flavor
-PRON- love the rich quality of the olive_oil and the lemon be such a refreshing touch
the salad contain mince garlic and onion as_well_as salty savory parmesan cheese
the mister steal a_few bite and proclaim -PRON- to be one of the good salad -PRON- be ever taste
joey 's ceasar salad in chagrin falls in also on the list
for -PRON- dinner -PRON- order the minestrone soup
without a doubt this be one of the hearty minestrone -PRON- have ever have
this thing be chock full of root vegetable and bean so fill
-PRON- have quite a kick too luckily -PRON- whimpy taste_bud could handle -PRON- though
the mister be kind_enough to let -PRON- pick from all the decadent dessert offering
in_addition to the standard menu the server explain some of the valentine_'s_day feature
-PRON- hear the word chocolate bomb and be sell
the chocolate coating contain rich and creamy chocolate mousse like a little present from the chocolate god
while some chocolate dish can be too rich and quickly weigh -PRON- down this be the perfect_balance
-PRON- mouth be water just think about -PRON-
the mister and -PRON- decide that -PRON- will be head back to michaelangelo 's very soon
but this time -PRON- both plan on order soup and salad that way -PRON- will have room for an_extra dessert
this be such a great evening
the ambiance of the restaurant be very romantic and -PRON- love every minute of chat with the mister and enjoy -PRON- company
let -PRON- face -PRON- valentine_'s_day dinner have a pretty bad rep
from noisy and over crowd restaurant to poor service and cold food -PRON- have hear all the horror story
but if anything michaelangelo 's go_above and beyond to make_sure -PRON- dining_experience be special
-PRON- waiter be so helpful and attentive and -PRON- never feel_rush
make_sure -PRON- give michaelangelo 's a try for -PRON- next special_occasion -PRON- will make_sure -PRON- leave with some great memory
ra have never_disappoint -PRON- -PRON- happy_hour deal be incredible and -PRON- ingredient be always fresh
the menu be very creative for sushi especially the dynamite plate

-PRON- dog be a small dog but all muscle
-PRON- be a 25 lb boston too big to play with most of the small dog that be in the small dog area and -PRON- be to small to play with the large breed
the first_time -PRON- go to this park -PRON- miss -PRON- and drive right by think -PRON- be a corner park for the house in the area
-PRON- be use to kellogg zaher park for the dog
large with 3 area
the small dog area be nice for a_few dog but when -PRON- get 5 6 dog plus owner -PRON- crowded
-PRON- keep rhe area nice and clean
stock with doggie bag and seating for the human
-PRON- look and mayne miss -PRON-
but -PRON- do_not see a water spout to fill_up a bowl or let -PRON- dig drink from

and -PRON- just do_not taste good
the quality of the beef be just awful
-PRON- seem_like
fry be not that great either
only_thing -PRON- have go be -PRON- jameson bbq_sauce
-PRON- most_likely will hit up -PRON- happy_hour just to taste other food -PRON- get but so_far not a fan_of this_place
also base_on look_at the menu a lot seem overprice
night life seem_like -PRON- have potential but doubt anyone go there since -PRON- be in a plaza

and -PRON- be also in_town the follow week and get -PRON- again
-PRON- be that good
-PRON- would definitely_return when -PRON- be in the area again
-PRON- also have a $_20 breakfast buffet that be good
not a full on buffet but like a continental breakfast on steroid
there be two word that east end love use and -PRON- just happen to describe -PRON- product perfectly good beer
-PRON- have never be disappoint with a trip to the brewery
-PRON- be a small operation but -PRON- can really tell how_much care and effort be put into all the beer
the regular especially big hop and black strap stout be all fantastic but the more adventurous beer be a delight as_well
there be usually at_least one sour beer as_well_as at_least one barrel age choice for those that enjoy something a little different
growler fill be pretty_good usually $_12 18 depend_on the beer and -PRON- even have six pack of big hop can
east end be the place to go if -PRON- want good fresh beer in a cool space surround_by people_who know and love craft_beer
-PRON- stay_here for new year
here be the problem
-PRON- be too_far from the strip
yes there be a free shuttle and -PRON- be great but who want to take a shuttle when -PRON- can just stay on the strip
what orleans do well be stand alone
the place be the only casino within a reasonable distance and have all the amenity that -PRON- need
also this_place be the home of the las_vegas wranglers echl hockey team
like -PRON- say amazing
-PRON- food be tasty and -PRON- be all vegetarian if that be -PRON- thing
the price be really good for buffet $ 12.99 even on weekend
the service be not the great when -PRON- come to pick_up -PRON- plate
but the food be good and the price as_well
the ambiance of this hookah bar be pretty relaxing
-PRON- be darkly light with a couple of sofa strew around
there be a couple of huge television play melodic arabic music
so_far so good
-PRON- can_not complain_about the hookah or the service
the staff be friendly and -PRON- even have a nice collection of hookah flavor and zippos
if -PRON- be look for a nice seclude place to relax and unwind -PRON- would suggest the hubbly

-PRON- have be twice and will absolutely be back
-PRON- actually end_up here after walk_out of the vig after the last bad_experience -PRON- will have there

if -PRON- could give this_place 10 star -PRON- would
-PRON- can_not get enough of this amazing food
the location be fabulous right_across from the fountain at bellagio and -PRON- have outdoor_seating so -PRON- can watch the fountain as_well_as people_watch
the service be phenomenal and very understanding and helpful
the food however be the real gem
-PRON- can_not find anything comparable which be the only bummer because -PRON- will leave -PRON- crave more
-PRON- favorite steak place in_vegas
-PRON- would spend every birthday here if i could
-PRON- favorite be the sirloin and bacon wrap filet_mignon
-PRON- have come_here a_few time with -PRON- 10_year old_daughter who have -PRON- in -PRON- mind that this_place be awesome and -PRON- may be right about the food but very inconsistent service and the discount card -PRON- give -PRON- be such bs
-PRON- pay close to $_50 every_time -PRON- go and -PRON- have a punch card for 10 discount but not on -PRON- total order but just the least expensive burrito so usually work out to $_1
-PRON- do_not like misleading promotion like these and have decide to take -PRON- business elsewhere
have a great experience
service be on point food be amazing and like the atmosphere
the sashimi especially be really fresh and tasty
finally a reasonable_price sushi restaurant in scottsdale that do -PRON- well

reasoning be support for all the work that take place
-PRON- bill be reasonable repair be do honestly and quickly

be go here for 3_year and have yet to be disappoint
the owner be amazing and coach -PRON- through every_single step
also a great price
highly_recommend
this_place be sure hard to find but the pizza be surly worth the visit
the restaurant be tuck in the very empty old strip_mall and the actual place be in the corner
-PRON- have be there over 25 year and the interior be pretty outdated
-PRON- have great service but could of be -PRON- be the first customer there for lunch
the staff tell -PRON- -PRON- be very busy during winter the snowbird but summer be much slow
if -PRON- be -PRON- first_visit the regular crust be a must to try
sourdough pizza crust be delicious
the food be awesome restaurant staff be very_friendly
cuba cafe give -PRON- that welcome vib like -PRON- din from the comfort of -PRON- home
this be the bad salsa club ever
-PRON- have be go on and off for yrs and every_time -PRON- go
-PRON- get remind of why -PRON- do_not go often
the management and staff be just plain rude
very unfriendly and offer poor_customer_service
-PRON- have so_many complaint to mention
-PRON- really do_not_know_why people put up with this disrespectful behavior perhaps because there be limited choice in this city for latin club
even the clientele during the evening dancing be pretty snobby after all -PRON- be in yorkville
-PRON- always prefer el rancho
the staff be friendly always have a smile on -PRON- face and the clientele be also fun and friendly
if there be a problem the management provide good customer_service
-PRON- seem to value -PRON- customer which be more_than -PRON- can say for babaluu
-PRON- will not be go_back
that be for sure
many of -PRON- friend feel the same way about this_place
canadians be complacent and do_not complain_about any thing -PRON- seem that -PRON- enjoy pay to be abuse and not to be treat as a respected customer
if -PRON- be not latin really young and do_not_know good -PRON- may enjoy this_place as the music be pretty_good
but -PRON- enjoy the variety at el rancho more
legit iced_tea
david_'s kind_of remind -PRON- of -PRON- version_of teavana
hundred of canister of tea range_from black to green to white
oolong etc
-PRON- name -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- in every flavor scent fruit whatev
so -PRON- be on the search for a real iced_tea
just tea with ice
david_'s lure -PRON- in with a free sample which be then explain that -PRON- will make -PRON- into iced_tea
finally
and -PRON- be delicious too
-PRON- also have\/had a travel cup for iced_tea which be about $_10 but allow -PRON- refill at $_1 instead_of the full price which if -PRON- be live in mtl right the heck now -PRON- would totally be in for that
heyyy mannn if -PRON- usually talk like how -PRON- be writin right_now and -PRON- like wanna spend -PRON- time hangin out and do_not_mind waitin and waitin for -PRON- sammich this be the place to be dude
anyhoo -PRON- take -PRON- 20_minute for -PRON- sandwich to be make
the bread be nicely toast the ingredient and sauce be plentiful but the thai jerk sandwich taste a_bit strange to -PRON- probably relate to the sauce and be not worth the really long_wait for lunch
-PRON- be an ok place to go especially if -PRON- want to have vegetarian_option
food have sometimes be a 4 sometimes a 2
same for the service
portion be large though which be nice
come to azarias for dinner last_night with -PRON- family
-PRON- love the decor the b&w photo on the wall be all from the 40's\/50 's -PRON- be guess of the owner 's family
lovely touch
-PRON- arrive at 8_p.m. on a saturday and -PRON- be packed
you'll have to speak up in this_place but no_matter seating be cozy and not cramp
a little basil plant with scissor be on every table which be a cute touch
-PRON- order a whole bunch_of stuff -summer green salad -hot spicy house bake dry pork strip -grill lobster_tail
-truffl
mushroom risotto
-sauteed collard green
-sea salt fry -chocolate turtle cake
everything except for the lobster_tail be 5\/5
the lobster_tail be a little bland and dry
-PRON- want to come_back and try the cauliflower leek smash with roasted corn
mmm
lovely choice on a street pack with awesome eat
the pad_thai with vermicelli noodle be absolutely fantastic
and the curry so good
the sauce be what make the food really shine especially the sauce from the mixed vegetable dish
the menu indicate vegetarian dish and which can be make gluten_free which be also a plus
eat_here many_time while the pizza be good -PRON- a_little_bit over price
expect to leave this_place by spend at_least 50 dollar on pizza and maybe a small salad
plenty_of local pizza_joint offer good deal
or save -PRON- and just go get good wood_fire pizza for less price
a large pizza be about 16 buck with no topping for thin_crust pizza
-PRON- really like this_place
-PRON- have be a handful of time now
and -PRON- have always have a good time
-PRON- be friendly with good food and beer
last_night -PRON- order be quite delay because of a trip breaker
after -PRON- finish -PRON- delicious if delay supper the server bring -PRON- some dessert on the house
-PRON- be a small gesture but -PRON- mean a lot
will_definitely keep visit
-PRON- agree with the 3_star
aok
healthy choice at airport
expensive but fill bento_box to go at $_14
have several little roll piece 3 sushis and some seaweed
eh but good_than a burger and fry
2 drink order with a set of nachos the management team be stand there take picture of the amazing drink art unfortunately there be not any coordination on which drink be out
who chronologically have be service
maybe this type_of place be mean for the people that be willing_to donate money and walk_away without drink or food horrible service horrible coordination can_not come_back
new poke restaurant in_town
like the mango topping jalapeño and house dressing
have regular bowl last_time
will get large bowl nest time
amazing food so hard to_choose_from everything
the smoothie and juice r delicious too
-PRON- can_not go_wrong_with that wellness drink
this joint hand_down kick pizza hut domino or papa johns in the behind so bad -PRON- be not even funny
some may say that the crust of a pizza determine the greatness
mostly this statement in all of -PRON- falsehood be utter by the female gender and that be ok
however if -PRON- a male -PRON- would probably agree that -PRON- the topping that make a pizza great
guy how many_time have -PRON- get a pizza and tell -PRON- i wish -PRON- could have get back there and make -PRON- -PRON-
well -PRON- do_not have to dream anymore if -PRON- patronize this particular l.c.'s
topping be very_generous at this_place all -PRON- have to do be say heavy on the topping when -PRON- call -PRON- in
the emp
that make the pizza somehow always honor that request and still manage to keep -PRON- job
since -PRON- start go to l.c. 's
-PRON- have not patronize any_other pizza_joint
if the competition make -PRON- pizza with as many topping as this_place the cost to -PRON- would be unfavorable for lack of a good word
the manager be very cool -PRON- run by a man name johnny and -PRON- have assure speed accuracy and quality in hundred of pizza i have purchase from there
-PRON- employee never have an attitude and genuinly appear happy to be work
-PRON- good trait without a doubt be -PRON- friendlyness and that make -PRON- very approachable so shout at -PRON- if -PRON- ever go in there
this eos be one of the old location
-PRON- have be to the one in gilbert and tempe and to be honest
this one be the least maintain out of all of -PRON-
-PRON- notice -PRON- get 3 new stair master which be a plus
the old one would always break and -PRON- do_not like the ergonomic
the new one be from life fitness
and -PRON- love those
this_location have everything -PRON- need if -PRON- be not picky about cleanliness
-PRON- come_here when -PRON- do_not want to drive to the tempe location
the kitchen sink be a six egg omelet with diced turkey hot_dog pepper chili and more
-PRON- be not a huge_fan_of meat cut into perfectly square cube
-PRON- remind -PRON- of grade school hot lunch but -PRON- eat half of -PRON- and box up the rest

bad customer_service
very dissapointed and do_not appreciate get yell for wait patiently by david
will_never return
nothing to complain_about but -PRON- would say there be other restaurant that serve up pretty_much the same_thing as waffles incaffeinated
so unless -PRON- be in the area or live nearby -PRON- probably would not come_back
the menu be a decent size but -PRON- do expect to see more inventive and varied us of the waffle consider this be the premise of the restaurant
there be basically two kind_of sweet waffle berry or a combo of banana and chocolate or a_few savory waffle a normal breakfast with a waffle throw in
the waffle -PRON- be also nothing_spectacular
-PRON- almost taste_like the waffle be just microwave
-PRON- be not golden brown or with that nice crisp crust but instead more soft and chewy
now for the positive as -PRON- do overall enjoy -PRON- meal there
the service be quick and -PRON- can use the no wait app to put -PRON- on the waitlist
during practice for -PRON- upcoming tournament both -PRON- very expensive volleyball decide to give up the ghost and literally explode
-PRON- be in a panic as -PRON- typical go to location nearby for pick_up high_end tournament volleyball for practice have go by the wayside
sure there be still dick 's sporting good but -PRON- location be just too_far away_from -PRON- practice venue and -PRON- be rush hour no less
this be where c&s sporting good come to the rescue
-PRON- literally can_not even count how many_time -PRON- have pass_by this_place and make a mental note to stop in some day

this_place be not that big but from -PRON- quick survey of the establishment -PRON- have a fairly decent selection
and the two people that work there be quite friendly and adept in -PRON- knowledge of what -PRON- have in -PRON- inventory
that be what -PRON- love about small business
-PRON- care attention and heart for -PRON- product and service as_well_as -PRON- customer manifest -PRON- in a tangible and perceptible manner
-PRON- will_definitely make this -PRON- stop for any future sporting gear need
the food here be decent but -PRON- will not return after how -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- have repeatedly be treat
everytime -PRON- visit the restaurant -PRON- be the same_thing
-PRON- end_up wait_forever to have -PRON- order take and the waitress be rude and never check up on -PRON- table
have a partner who work in some of the fine restaurant on the strip sit_down to a meal with -PRON- and be treat as such be absolutely apall
the last straw be when -PRON- order a dish and the taste be fishy and rancid and the noodle be over cook
when -PRON- ask for the manager the girl be extremely_rude and combative until finally -PRON- have the manager come to -PRON- table
after politely explain that the dish simply do_not taste edible the manager be defensive and condescending and tell -PRON- that the dish be suppose to taste_like that
the dish be suppose to taste_like garbage
-PRON- refuse to take -PRON- off -PRON- bill or even swap -PRON- out for something_else
-PRON- pay and leave promptly and never return

one of -PRON- favorite go to dish be the tikka_masala
sadly this_location 's tikka_masala do_not taste_like what be make at other location and -PRON- have eat that dish at at_least 4 other location
the server bring -PRON- another tikka_masala without all the paprika sprinkle on -PRON- but the whole dish be off
-PRON- do_not even satisfy -PRON- want for indian_food so -PRON- will have to go to an indian place tonight
-PRON- love pita jungle but this_place do_not deliver one of -PRON- standard dish
great spot and great breakfast food

all be very_tasty and come_out quick
tip
share a meal so_much food
awesome service ask for tina
will_definitely_come_back
use to be -PRON- favorite place
recently -PRON- change the menu for some_reason
and -PRON- do_not like -PRON- at all
the tuna tartar the blt salmon and bunch_of other item be go
the new menu be cheap poor_quality and prepare by rookie
do_not come expect authentic
no msg and not oily
the har gow and siu mai be amongst the clean -PRON- have ever taste
not_sure where the shrimp be in the har gow but -PRON- be flavorful from shitake
duck potsticker be not what -PRON- expect with strong cumin flavor but quite good and artistic with the lace
do_not love the tea
do_not trust the perfect tea timer
the green_tea be weak
request for spicy level of guac barely_any heat but nice addition of queso fresco and corn_tortilla be soft and fragrant
all three taco order be well_season and brim with meat
customer matter here -PRON- send the spring_roll back because the menu do_not indicate -PRON- be a fry version
large variety on the menu
-PRON- leave want more and hop there be time to return
on a cold winter day when -PRON- be snowy and miserable outside
-PRON- know where -PRON- want to head to for a couple of hour
seoul zimzilbang korean sauna
-PRON- be to korean sauna when -PRON- visit seoul
-PRON- can tell -PRON- that zimzilbang be as good\/authentic or even good
24\/7 -PRON- never never close
and -PRON- be welcome to stay as long as -PRON- like
just love lie around hang_out with friend -PRON- be just a different experience than go out to for a drink or dinner or coffee with friend
the experience here be more intimate feel more like a sleepover spacious resting area big sofa to lay around
tv to watch
free_wifi access yes -PRON- need to be connect even when -PRON- in a sauna
even a pool_table
the different sauna room that have different mineral on -PRON- wall suppose to give -PRON- different health benefit
-PRON- can_imagine if -PRON- be an out of towner -PRON- will come_here for the sauna have a nap workout on the exercise bike have a shower write yelp_review all for $_20
that be much cheap_than stay in a hotel\/motel
atmosphere here be really casual and -PRON- will see family with kid spend a couple of hour here
-PRON- feel totally refresh and relaxed after -PRON- sauna experience
btw that 100c room be freak hot
-PRON- be a huge_fan_of the food network 's dinners dives and dive in
so when guy be rave_about how la pizza al forno be one of the good pizza 's -PRON- ever have -PRON- believe -PRON-
of_course since -PRON- live only 15_minute away_from the place -PRON- call pizza heaven -PRON- have to go
first_time -PRON- come_here there be people pack on the street wait for -PRON- turn to be seat
as -PRON- be a sat night the wait be 45_minute
-PRON- deny -PRON- self heaven only because -PRON- tummy be not go to be deny any long period
-PRON- go to cibo 's -PRON- will get to that review in a sec and decide that -PRON- would go to al forno next sat
early next sat -PRON- be seat within_minute of arrive_early sat
afternoon although -PRON- be pack
the place be dimly light and fill with the aroma of back good
-PRON- order the italian stallion and -PRON- be on -PRON- table and in -PRON- mouth in 10_minute
no really 10_minute
-PRON- handmade brick oven be not joke around
now to the pizza be -PRON- a slice of pizza heaven
sure
but -PRON- be glad -PRON- do_not wait 45_minute for -PRON-
calm.down.guy
this be -PRON- 1 big concern
about half way_through the hof -PRON- realize -PRON- be lunch and decide to head over to the cafeteria
as with place like this -PRON- expect the food to be overprice but be not expect to get totally rip_off
a veggie wrap for $_4.50 seem_like the good deal on the menu and at_least -PRON- do have a vegetarian_option
and perhaps -PRON- be but -PRON- be much small than -PRON- expect
and since everything be make in the morning and already wrap -PRON- can_not tell -PRON- no onion for instance
food allergy will come into play a lot here
-PRON- be sure as -PRON- have to get the food the way -PRON- be make
-PRON- husband choose to get a side salad and -PRON- laugh when -PRON- realize a side salad be not a small salad but a small_portion of macaroni salad or tomato and cheese salad
-PRON- be both hungry when -PRON- leave
-PRON- do_not buy chip or candy but -PRON- can get a small bag of chip for $_1.00 or a regular sized candy bar for $ 2.00 if -PRON- be thirsty -PRON- be in luck because -PRON- have soda water and juice but -PRON- be the small bottle -PRON- have ever see for $ 2.00
that be for the soda juice may be more
this be to encourage people to buy more -PRON- be sure and to avoid sharing
-PRON- could easily sell -PRON- for $_1.00 a piece and still make a killing but -PRON- be more interested_in be greedy
when -PRON- enter the museum and when -PRON- leave the cafeteria area -PRON- will see sign say no outside food or drink and no food or drink outside of the cafe
-PRON- be almost certain this be not to keep the exhibit safe as mostly everything be behind glass but a ploy to get -PRON- to spend more
by the time -PRON- be half way_through -PRON- will be so thirsty that -PRON- will have to buy an overpriced drink and then -PRON- will see the sign say -PRON- have to drink -PRON- all in the cafeteria area
there may have be water fountain by the bathroom but -PRON- doubt -PRON-
so -PRON- 1 suggestion be to eat before -PRON- go and tuck a drink in -PRON- purse for later
second problem be -PRON- photo
when -PRON- enter -PRON- take -PRON- picture as though -PRON- be about to set sail on a cruise and then -PRON- charge -PRON- just as much for -PRON-
when -PRON- go to the photo area -PRON- will see a large flat_screen tv behind the counter and will probably assume as -PRON- do that this be to display -PRON- picture so -PRON- can decide before -PRON- print -PRON- out if -PRON- want -PRON- or not
not so
this be merely to advertise that that be where -PRON- get -PRON- picture and -PRON- have slide show of previous visitor up there
-PRON- instead print out every_single picture and presumably toss the one that do_not get buy
-PRON- ask -PRON- to please not print out -PRON- photo as -PRON- doubt -PRON- would pay the $_20 for -PRON-
and -PRON- do_not want to waste the paper or ink and -PRON- be meet with an attitude by the girl behind the counter
-PRON- say -PRON- print out everyone 's photo as if that make a difference
that make the problem bad
-PRON- would just expect such a museum to take more interest in protect -PRON- resource
-PRON- be sure -PRON- find that people be more likely to buy the photo if -PRON- be in front of -PRON- but again -PRON- be just be greedy
aside_from that -PRON- find the history on the track very interesting and -PRON- love see the different grade percentage for the track
-PRON- have a 33 degree grade that -PRON- can step on very similar to one that exist if -PRON- visit the daytona track
the history on the car -PRON- find to be very boring
the hard card activity be more hassle than -PRON- be worth as -PRON- wait in line to try each one and then some of the machine do_not even work
-PRON- can get parking diagonally across the street for $_5 which -PRON- think be the good value all day
admission price be not too pricey either -PRON- do_not think
oh and the simulator ride cost extra
except for the attitude -PRON- get from the photo girl everyone_else be very_nice
but this be really something -PRON- visit only once
-PRON- can_not imagine -PRON- will ever go_back
all in all -PRON- doubt -PRON- would_recommend the nascar hall of fame for -PRON- there be very little -PRON- take_away_from -PRON-
decent gym with a very low monthly payment
-PRON- prefer this_location rather_than the old greenway one
-PRON- a little run_down
but what the hell -PRON- be there to pick_up iron
so who care anyway
-PRON- still love_this_place
but -PRON- be update -PRON- comment due_to the crazy dynamic some parent be create for everyone_else
-PRON- love kid -PRON- have four
-PRON- love meet -PRON- friend and -PRON- kid here
what -PRON- do_not love be watch parent completely ignore -PRON- kid and let -PRON- run and scream\/shriek constantly across the business for over_an_hour
last_night 2 couple let -PRON- 7 or 8 child create complete havoc in the back area -PRON- put what appear to be a 10 to 11 year_old girl in charge of several young kid
the staff and several patron suggest to the group that what -PRON- be do be disruptive and at time dangerous -the boy be climb up into a portion of the fence\/border area and disappear for a_bit one little girl come up behind some patron and just grab the leash of a dog and try to pull -PRON- away
-PRON- move dozen of rock to the fountain when -PRON- be not throw -PRON-
-PRON- get so bad that a half_dozen patron just decide to leave the bar_area and go_somewhere_else
-PRON- be to the point that a bouncer would have be call in if these have be adult
when all of this be bring to the attention of so call parent -PRON- do_not even_bother to get out of -PRON- seat
do_not ruin this awesome place for the rest_of -PRON-
-PRON- be generally not too crazy about terroni but the roof top patio at this_place be a killer
-PRON- go there for lunch one day and the view the comfortable setting and the decor make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be on beach in a four_star hotel
the service be ok and the food be typical terroni good but nothing_spectacular for what -PRON- charge and claim
-PRON- however be impressed_by -PRON- server 's knowledge of -PRON- wine
-PRON- go to patio from now on specially since -PRON- be not_too_crowded
there be also a table on the second_floor balcony patio be on the 3rd floor which be for large_group 8 10 that seem pretty amazing too
-PRON- order
rice ball with meat sauce and cheese + veal sandwich + pop = 20 $ for 2 people recommendation
comfort_food that make -PRON- full not a place for foodie that be look for something special +
1\/2 price vs portion -PRON- be very full but 20 $ be little_pricey for what -PRON- get
-1 taste rice ball literally a bowl of rice + cheese layer + basic tomato_sauce top bland nothing_special big than -PRON- expect about the size of cup of milk
240 ml veal sandwhich thin cut meat + cheese + mushroom + tomato_sauce bun and meat be not flavourful so most of the taste be tomato_sauce
double the size of a big mac + 1 comfortable place to eat
and -PRON- get serve
-PRON- have the chicken parm
the chicken have a crispy exterior with a moist flavorful center
the sauce be warm hearty and have a hint_of sweetness
-PRON- husband have a calzone which have an_amazing buttery flaky and delicious crust
-PRON- consider restaurant bonaparte 's food quality average to very good
service be excellent but for the value -PRON- believe -PRON- could be improve
-PRON- decide to go to this restaurant for dinner because of the great review on various website and magazine
-PRON- would only recommend -PRON- if -PRON- be convenient for the location in a hotel
but since montreal have so_many great restaurant -PRON- would try other place
-PRON- just move to this area and check this_place out on -PRON- move day
host be really nice
give -PRON- two more mango drinking as welcome to the neighborhood
curry be great and -PRON- wife really_enjoy the food
supreme taste for the coffee
service be great
the barista seem to know the stuff -PRON- sell very well and care_about customer -PRON- would be good if -PRON- can improve the decor of both inside and outside a_bit and -PRON- be in a good neighborhood
-PRON- be also a_bit far
so if dineen be open -PRON- would not have go there
really like -PRON- coffee tho
the good taco ever
full of flavor and meat
definitely -PRON- favorite place to get -PRON- taco from
the food and beer be overprice like crazy
-PRON- order an_appetizer and be so disappointed with -PRON- -PRON- leave
-PRON- will give -PRON- this -PRON- game room look fun but -PRON- appear that -PRON- be pay for all that extra space with the markup on -PRON- menu
$_4 for a bottled beer $_7.50 for a $_1 taco from taco_bell
if -PRON- have kid and also too_much money -PRON- would come_here to spend -PRON- and not give a damn
not for -PRON-
-PRON- have grab dinner to go here a couple time in the past_few month
-PRON- be excited to find another inexpensive mexican_restaurant close to where -PRON- live
most of -PRON- food seem pretty salty
-PRON- could live with about half the salt and -PRON- like a lot_of salt
but the spicy beef 9 live_up to -PRON- 's name
if -PRON- like spicy food -PRON- would_highly_recommend try the 9
consider that amados be just a couple minute away -PRON- probably will not try this_place again
terrific thai food and a huge hit in -PRON- office
while -PRON- be always busy the food be always on time and make just right
never have a bad_experience here
-PRON- only disappointment be -PRON- no_longer delivery during_lunch hour only dinner hour
this_place really have be boom over the last couple of year
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have be look for a good japanese curry place every since -PRON- leave okinawa in 2003 coco 's be the place in okinawa and boy do -PRON- luck up on this_place
-PRON- have try several place in california and here in_las_vegas
this_place be it
if -PRON- be to close -PRON- eye and go purely on taste alone -PRON- would think -PRON- be in okinawa sit_at coco 's
the chicken katsu -PRON- bread and have just the right crisp to -PRON-
-PRON- opt_for a level 2 which have just the right_amount_of heat for -PRON- and -PRON- wife go with the mild
-PRON- also say -PRON- remind -PRON- or okinawa and -PRON- take to go plate as_well
if -PRON- have a craving for japanese curry try this_place
if -PRON- have not try japanese curry and want to try this_place
great selection for the size of the store very small
this be the place to go for independent music in the phx area
as other have say get there be a_bit tricky
the west_side market be one of -PRON- regular stop each week
the market be full of different good like fresh fruit and vegetable sweet coffee juice and meat
-PRON- love go here and try different thing each week while also grab some of -PRON- favorite
one of the good place to stop_by be the juice garden
the juice garden offer a mixture_of juice smoothie and wheat grass
but the good juice -PRON- offer be a the rise sun
-PRON- be a mixture_of pineapple carrot orange and apple
now -PRON- be not a huge_fan_of carrot or pineapple but the way this be mixed be amazing and -PRON- do_not even realize what -PRON- be eat
the market also provide cheap price for item like flax and chia seed compare to what -PRON- would find at a store
often time due_to the packaging price on these item be a lot high_than if -PRON- simply get -PRON- from place like fresh thyme where -PRON- do_not package -PRON-
tip
the market can get very busy to where -PRON- can barely walk and -PRON- be bump into people
if -PRON- want to avoid the hassle and be able_to walk_around at -PRON- own_pace go early on the weekend or on the weekday
-PRON- suggest on the weekend get to the market by 10:30am and on the weekday by 11_a.m. at the late
-PRON- get a half_dozen specialty donut and -PRON- be fantastic
plus the staff be super_friendly
-PRON- love_this_place
always crowded and loud casual great mexican_food for phoenix at reasonable_price
this food be close to tex_mex which be what -PRON- prefer
can_not go_wrong_with the tee pee special or the presidential special
nice patio out front
good chip and salsa when -PRON- sit_down
cold beer and margaritas
what be not to love
-PRON- be an_amazing experience but certainly think the price could be low
$ 119 for the jump alone 129 for the jump with the pic and $ 149 for the jump pic and video
just like what everyone_else say -PRON- be nerve wreck before the jump
but afterwards -PRON- be smooth sailing
-PRON- husband and -PRON- find this_place like 2_year_ago and when -PRON- in the mood -PRON- go there for -PRON-
-PRON- be the gyro combo and for -PRON-
-PRON- be the lamb kabob plate
so yummy
half way thru the meal
-PRON- stwich
and i get -PRON- husbands fry and -PRON- get -PRON- rice
the green dressing be so good but beware -PRON- be spicy
-PRON- use a special blend of spice for -PRON- fry and -PRON- be so good
no prepared food -PRON- cook when u order
so if -PRON- busy -PRON- can take a while
also the hummus be really good
really good middle_eastern food
meh go in with high_expectation
-PRON- have definitely have good fish and chip
old yorke be a little more authentic
this_place be not bad but -PRON- be not the good fish and chip in the city
-PRON- do like the csr component and the gluten_free option
that be the only_reason -PRON- would come_back -PRON- be not that the taste will bring -PRON- back
this be -PRON- 3rd visit here but -PRON- first_time order a burger
well -PRON- think the girl that be take -PRON- order be listen
maybe because -PRON- have such a big order before -PRON- -PRON- be not think
but -PRON- order the simi serious burger with tomato lettuce onion fresh jalapeno and guacamole 1000 dressing and spicy seasoning
hubby get the serious burger
welp get wax pepper instead_of jalapeno and no guacamole
-PRON- do_not even think -PRON- put the spicy season on -PRON-
this burger be so bland
-PRON- be glad -PRON- bring -PRON- home
-PRON- have to bust out with -PRON- own seasoning to make -PRON- taste ok
so 2 burger and 2 med onion_ring $ 35.00
-PRON- be not worth -PRON-
not even a drink for that price
there onion_ring be really good though
-PRON- can order 1 m and share -PRON- with 2 people
-PRON- do_not see -PRON- go_back there for a burger
-PRON- may try the salad
depend_on the price
cheap plenty_of food and delicious with very_friendly staff
would definitely refer friend and family
-PRON- be one of those family try to cut wayyyyyyyyy back on fast_food
but -PRON- daughter love wendy_'s
and sigh
-PRON- be a fan too
neither of -PRON- eat beef but wendy_'s chicken offering be not bad
-PRON- usually get a grill_chicken something or other
either the sandwich or one of the small wrap
rarely -PRON- will get the chicken nugget
-PRON- daughter love the spicy nugget
an aside not specific to this_location but just a comment_on the nugget in_general the spicy nugget be not as plump as the regular nugget
blehhh
this_location have be clean every_time -PRON- have visit which be maybe once a month as -PRON- shop the merchant in this area often
the counter people be usually friendly especially so on -PRON- visit last_night
now -PRON- be not a violent person but let -PRON- just say -PRON- would step on -PRON- beloved boyfriend 's neck to get to -PRON- dessert
lemon bar
oh_yeah pie
oh heeeeeeell
yeah
fresh perfectly sweet and simply delightful
besides the yummy tasty treat -PRON- also enjoy a couple of -PRON- breakfast item
-PRON- french_toast with a berry compote be two little slice of heaven
do_not get -PRON- start on -PRON- bacon
bacon dot yeah
-PRON- can_not wait to go here again to sample many more of -PRON- dish
-PRON- will probably go so often -PRON- will be like cheer up in that piece norm
-PRON- receive a box load of coin from -PRON- father-
do some research and find pv coin jewelry to be rat quite nicely
jonah be very_helpful in educate -PRON- in the way silver be price and how i can research date location on coin
-PRON- be very informative and -PRON- be impress the the knowledge offer up to help -PRON- with save and selling
if -PRON- be not go to do be talk into a sale presentation go to this resort will probably be fine
-PRON- agree and honestly -PRON- be like be pressure at a use car dealership
-PRON- send over a total of 3 rep and go over the time -PRON- have promise which be a shame as -PRON- have make plan for later
not all of the staff be rude but all -PRON- take be a couple to ruin the experience and impression of a place
some employee promise or offer certain incentive for go to the informational talk then other try to get money in exchange for the same offer
some of the staff be rude agressive insult and pretty_much call -PRON- and -PRON- fiancee liar
one guy scott be cool and proffessional
most of the staff not pertain to sell -PRON- membership be helpful and friendly
the resort be under construction now but the other_than_that the pool be nice
the gym be not huge but -PRON- do offfer a complimentary shuttle to the strip
so if -PRON- avoid the sales\/membership\/ talk -PRON- will probably be good off
-PRON- join about two year_ago
at the time -PRON- like that -PRON- be a simple no frill gym and that a good percentage of the clientele be middle age want to stay fit
at the time -PRON- be plain but clean
now -PRON- stay only because of -PRON- awesome trainer nicole
-PRON- be extremely disappointed how dirty and run_down the place have become
the lady room be disgusting the sink faucet be disintegrate and the floor be always filthy
-PRON- change at work beforehand because -PRON- refuse to touch anything -PRON- do_not need to
the equipment be coat with dust and sweat
the front_desk kid should not be require to do the cleaning
the owner need to hire a professional company to come in weekly
-PRON- pay a fortune for -PRON- personal trainer management need to invest in the location
there be too_much competition available to be so cheap with -PRON- facility

-PRON- obviously buy 4
-PRON- generally go to the dealer for most thing but -PRON- can_not beat be in and out in less_than 15_minute
five_star just for the time -PRON- save -PRON-
-PRON- even let -PRON- leave the baby in -PRON- car seat sleep
so -PRON- would not have to wake -PRON-
favorite place to get pizza
and the reason behind this due_to a very special someone at this store
-PRON- be caring funny smart and not to mention very very hot
do_not get -PRON- wrong the pizza be hot and fine but so be this manager
1\/5 for service
-PRON- have be here_several_time -PRON- consider -PRON- a regular
-PRON- be a busy night
so -PRON- friend
and -PRON- wait about 25 min for a table
once -PRON- be seat -PRON- wait another 10 minuet before -PRON- be ask what -PRON- want to drink
the food come_out decently fast but -PRON- waitress forget to oil -PRON- grill in order for -PRON- to cook -PRON- food

-PRON- come_here for the food
-PRON- wish -PRON- service be good -PRON- would come more_often
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- both love come_here

pool_table and dart board if -PRON- be into that as_well_as dj syn on wednesday and fridays or one of the weekend day
when -PRON- first come_here the pool be heated year round and open_24_hour
now -PRON- do_not heat -PRON- at all and -PRON- close at like 10 or something
lame
cheyenne be very artistic
-PRON- rarely know_what design -PRON- want -PRON- always leave excited about -PRON- nail
the gel pedi be fabulous
do_not forget to add paraffin to -PRON- pedi
highly_recommend cheyenne
phone_number be no_longer connect to this business
-PRON- will go into this review in more detail when -PRON- return home
but this be absolutely the bad of -PRON- franchise -PRON- have ever encounter
could_not even redeem -PRON- free birthday drink -PRON- computer would not use -PRON- good card to register -PRON- credit and $_1 for a cup of ice
bill in total $_7 for a venti frapp and $_7 of pastry
just irritate more_than anything since -PRON- expect a universal standard of quality and service when -PRON- revisit such vendor
a fellow customer and -PRON- banter in agreement when -PRON- just ask for a cup of ice water as_well
-PRON- will_never renew here again
the new management and ownership be an_absolute nightmare
none_of the amenity be as post
laundry facility be constantly break
security be nowhere to be find
bedroom be half finished floor be constantly chip and hole lead to the outside can be see everywhere
thing be constantly require maintenance
not to mention the one woman_who work here who actually care_about the resident kathy be let go
kathy be always there to help out resident and do the good -PRON- could
-PRON- enjoy this_place at first
but now -PRON- would not even live here if -PRON- be free
run not walk_away
bring back kathy be the only_thing that could save this_place for -PRON-
the service be amazing
-PRON- server be very sweet and real -PRON- would def recommend -PRON- friend and family to come_here for breakfast
the atmosphere be chill and relaxed and -PRON- food be absolutely_amazing
no_complaint on -PRON- end
-PRON- usually stay_at hampton inns but think -PRON- would give doubletree a try since -PRON- in the hilton family
myth bust
the hilton name mean nothing
-PRON- be extremely disappointed
besides the fact_that the layout be terribly inconvenient get from the lobby to the room there be a very musty mildewy odor that be hard to get over
-PRON- hear -PRON- use to be a wyndam garden hotel but -PRON- look -PRON- up on google earth and -PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- be a la quinta inn at one time
-PRON- suppose if -PRON- charge la quinta price -PRON- may expect the bad_experience -PRON- have but -PRON- leave $ 230 poor for two night stay and be expect to pay_$ 9.95 if -PRON- want to use the internet
be -PRON- serious
even that be complimentary at hampton inn
at_least -PRON- get a $_25 gas card to ease the blow
upon_arrival mr. bubbles greet -PRON- in monotone process -PRON- credit_card and say here be -PRON- cookie and -PRON- gas card
that be awkward -PRON- be as if -PRON- have ask for or even know -PRON- be get the cookie
just here be -PRON- cookie
not -PRON- see -PRON- have travel a long way here be some warm cookie to brighten -PRON- day
so -PRON- try to remain positive -PRON- think maybe -PRON- -PRON- maybe -PRON- be just tired
-PRON- go to -PRON- room
-PRON- enter the 2nd floor hallway and notice a blood stain a large blood stain on the carpet in the hall just before -PRON- get to the room that completely weird -PRON- out
-PRON- stay in room 218
the room appear to be well appoint but upon further inspection -PRON- notice the back of the flat paint hollow core bathroom door be filthy and the wallpapered light switch cover be equally filthy
yuck
-PRON- be so gross out
the caulking around the tub look_like a 6 year_old do -PRON-
after close inspection -PRON- crawl in bed
the bed be the most ridiculously uncomfortable bed -PRON- have ever sleep in unless -PRON- count the pull out couch -PRON- stay on once as a kid
-PRON- locate the remote and discover that there be no food network or hgtv or any of the other basic cable channel -PRON- may expect be -PRON- serious
there be so_much hallway noise in this property -PRON- just retarded the kid run up and down the hall could be remedi if there be security present
this be not the hotel fault but there be people talk in the hallway at all hour like -PRON- live in a barn
there be huge gap under the door maybe when -PRON- tear out the old 1972 shag carpet -PRON- leave a space and -PRON- never do anything about -PRON-
hey doubletree here be a clue replace the door with one that fit for the sake of -PRON- guest
important tip
the first night -PRON- forget to set the thermostat fan to on and hear plane come in till all hour
three thirty in the morning -PRON- be scream be quiet
as -PRON- neighbor on the second_floor apparently leave to catch early flight forget some people be still sleep
-PRON- recommend -PRON- do_not choose this hotel unless -PRON- only other choice be sleep on the street of charlotte
if -PRON- do stay_here set the fan to the permanently on position and leave -PRON- tv on low volume for white noise
add insult to injury -PRON- wake_up the first morning with a bite mark in -PRON- right forehead hairline do_not have a clue what thee
heck that be all about
-PRON- skin crawl to think about -PRON-
-PRON- still have not rule out that -PRON- have hitchhiker
as -PRON- be leave -PRON- encounter several of the housekeeping staff clutter the walkway near the elevator
-PRON- star and comment to each_other that everybody be try to get outta here -PRON- say good morning and -PRON- reply and star as -PRON- daughter and -PRON- struggle with -PRON- belonging
not one staff person ever offer a hand
-PRON- pass -PRON- part thought survey across the counter to the man at the front_desk and tell -PRON- -PRON- be the first person to have smile since -PRON- check in two day_ago
-PRON- say oh no and -PRON- say oh yes and out the door -PRON- go
-PRON- come to charlotte about once a month but -PRON- will_never stay there again
beware
doubletree charlotte airport be doublegross
zero_star
-PRON- have never be to a froyo place with good price
-PRON- have also never see people get so_much frozen_yogurt at once
maybe -PRON- be just -PRON- but everyone fill -PRON- cup until -PRON- cup could hold no more
this one dude have to get a second cup to specifically hold -PRON- topping
however -PRON- can_not blame -PRON-
-PRON- be scorch hot outside
the yogurt be thick and do_not melt while wait in line to pay
-PRON- come three_time within a couple of day and each_time -PRON- be jam pack
in_term_of hibachi restaurant experience kanji be on the top of -PRON- list
the large open space have 4 hibachi grill with open seating around -PRON-
yes -PRON- may sit next to a stranger gasp but be not that half the fun
the staff be excellent and make -PRON- evening a joy
drop the sake into -PRON- sake bomb be quick with a refill and even take some flavor sake shot with -PRON-
speak of -PRON- should def imbibe in a_few of those shot
-PRON- be delicious and relatively low in potency
the food be excellent as_well
the steak be cook_perfectly to order and stay tender -PRON- always find that food cook on a hibachi grill -PRON- harden up rather quickly scallop be large beef tataki be tatasty and the fry_rice and accompanying sauce be great accompaniment to the meat
-PRON- have have quite a_few hibachi chef_'s who come in do -PRON- routine and then walk off like nothing happen
that be not the case here
-PRON- dude be crackin joke talk to -PRON- make some new rice art sponge bob and an all around good dude
grab a group_of friend and head on over here
just make_sure -PRON- go low sodium for a_few day after
protip free sake bomb with yelp check in
literally leave there in tear after the way -PRON- treat -PRON-
tammy be horribly rude
although -PRON- know many nail_salon experience oriental speak between the worker
tammy use -PRON- to talk trash about -PRON- to the one do -PRON- nail after -PRON- request -PRON- need to redo -PRON- because -PRON- use too_much coat that -PRON- would not dry after wait an_hour for -PRON- to
between -PRON- and the other employer gene -PRON- be very rude and make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- have to keep the nail the way -PRON- be or pay another 45 dollar to redo -PRON- since accord to -PRON-
-PRON- already do -PRON- job
finally after all the crying and -PRON- rude behavior -PRON- ask to speak to the main boss
-PRON- come_out and help -PRON- out very fast and politely with no hesitation
-PRON- also apologize for the other two specially because -PRON- know -PRON- be a frequent customer
all in all -PRON- never think -PRON- will be write a bad review for -PRON- after so_many good visit
but when -PRON- make a customer cry -PRON- need to ask -PRON- what -PRON- do wrong
-PRON- will not be go_back
order take out rib wing
hubby say rib be tender and tasty
-PRON- have wing and have to say -PRON- only get 1 wing out of 15 the rest be drum -PRON- have never have an order of wing like that
just sayin geppettos
the food be decent but the price be way_too_much for what -PRON- be
avoid jacquelin if at all possible
-PRON- be not pleased to be work there and seem to think that a fast_food worker be a lot good_than the average person in short and a t_shirt
great upbeat atmosphere and stellar bbq
this be a must go to for awatukee and surround area
-PRON- only do the rib perfect seasoning no sauce need pull_pork and brisket
all have a perfect smoke ring seasoning moist tender and a great sauce on the side
a++++

-PRON- enjoy come_here for a snack after a long day

the bride be not a party animal and decide to invite some of -PRON- close friend for a spa day and night 's stay_at the hotel courtesy of -PRON- hubby to be who just happen to be mint lucky sod -PRON- arrive a little late as -PRON- be work then commute from glasgow and find -PRON- difficult to find the place as -PRON- just kind_of blend in with the surrounding
finally -PRON- find -PRON- and once inside realise that this_place do_not blend in at all
the surrounding be opulent and luxurious and the beauty room be relaxing and ambient with soft music playing and candle light totally take -PRON- away_from the hustle and bustle of the city centre
-PRON- have the skin consultation and back and shoulder massage which be simply divine
the package have also include lunch and dinner in the restaurant
but -PRON- do_not partake in any of that although -PRON- can highly_recommend -PRON- all from what the bride to be be tell -PRON-
-PRON- rave_about -PRON- for week
-PRON- have since notice that the spa break be £ 125 per_person include bed and breakfast lunch dinner two treatment and the consultation and use of the facility include gym and pool
-PRON- sound a lot
but -PRON- be actually brilliant value for money especially in this grand hotel
-PRON- have only be to this_place for breakfast and let -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- wonderful good breakfast ever that be if -PRON- on the run and in a hurry would not mine return and try the rest_of the menu
the home -PRON- purchase have a build in grill\/island very_nice fire magic grill that do_not work
15_year old
really bad shape
pack rat call -PRON- home and have chew thru the igniter wire as_well_as deposit all sort_of treasure
-PRON- have rust burner corrode disperser plate and cruddy grate as_well_as weather exterior
to replace would have be $ 3000 + for a new poorly make replacement
-PRON- call ed and the estimate -PRON- give be very_reasonable essentially a total rebuild
when the guy bring -PRON- back after a week in the shop -PRON- look brand_new
there be a little glitch in the lighting mechanism from some evidently previous work before -PRON- get -PRON-
but ed persevere and now -PRON- work and look_like brand_new
the food be good and the price be decent
-PRON- be not too hungry
so -PRON- order -PRON- a strawberry margarita and a plate of the habanero hot_wing $_8 because -PRON- be curious about the dry rub
the hot_wing be hot
-PRON- be a fan_of hot hot_wing
so -PRON- be satisfied but no one else at the table want to touch -PRON-
if -PRON- have ever order atomic hot_wing from wing stop -PRON- be not quite as spicy
but -PRON- definitely compare
but enough about hot_wing from a mexican_restaurant
the margarita be really good
wish -PRON- have one right_now
-PRON- have bite of chicken nachos a carne_asada plate and beef fajita delicious as_well
the fresh guacamole be great too although -PRON- hear complaint about the endless chip be too_salty
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- would come_back to yolos since there be so_many other place to try in_vegas but -PRON- would_recommend -PRON- to a first_timer look for fairly price mexican_food on the strip
cheap price for fresh produce and meat
everything be very fresh and -PRON- can get bulk spice grain and snack
-PRON- be a fan_of -PRON- double ad wednesday where the sale for both last_week and the current week apply
-PRON- have a good selection of beer and even have various flavor of lambic
this be a more specialized store focus more on small brand that be typically high_quality so -PRON- will not find -PRON- usual brand name item such_as coke or yoplait
this be -PRON- favorite restaurant in_las_vegas
the chilean sea_bass 10\/10 be the most scrumptious skewer of tender fish and -PRON- literally will melt_in -PRON- mouth
the peruvian bay scallop garlic style not on the menu ask for this be also not to be miss
excellent sake selection and -PRON- will also reheat -PRON- bottle for -PRON- if -PRON- get lukewarm
the yamato roll 10\/10
serve with foie_gra -PRON- just wish there be more_than 3 dang guess -PRON- get to order second
-PRON- recently get -PRON- ear lobe yes just the lobe
yes -PRON- realize most girl go_through this when -PRON- be 6 pierce at halo and have wonderful experience
-PRON- be extremely impressed_with how clean and sterile the environment be especially_since -PRON- always think -PRON- use to be pretty dingy look from the outside before frances and smeeks come around there
the staff obviously know -PRON- business very well which make -PRON- feel_comfortable
-PRON- piercer be the fierce ana who have a habit of talk to -PRON- while pierce to keep -PRON- at_ease
and as someone_who be afraid of needle -PRON- appreciate -PRON- not do that annoying
1 2
3 here -PRON- go
kind_of thing
-PRON- be a_bit shocked at the price $ 90 for both lobe how_much would this have cost -PRON- at clair 's
but when -PRON- consider that -PRON- use some insane high grade of medical steel for the earring and the overall professionalism of the experience -PRON- would say -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- go_back 2_month later when -PRON- hole be heal up and have ana remove the earring -PRON- have put in there -PRON- be tricky for a beginner which be do free of charge
if -PRON- ever get another piercing -PRON- will certainly be at halo
hire new security
light skinned guy_who -PRON- be not even sure be sober enough to be security be a little in -PRON- feeling
and -PRON- guess have a bad night decide to be rude for not reason to -PRON- party
mind -PRON- -PRON- be with a group_of super bowl champion and this guy leave a terrible taste in all of -PRON- mouth
-PRON- be a complete clown
even the police tell me to call and complain
great food
awesome historic house turn restaurant
-PRON- vegan daughter take -PRON- here for a wonderful lunch include -PRON- fantastic coffee
-PRON- all split -PRON- cookie like an oreo for dessert
the staff be knowledgeable_about the food and the menu offer a huge variety
do_not miss the taco
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- ask -PRON- uber drive to take -PRON- to somewhere that be open and -PRON- end_up here
-PRON- be bad however
-PRON- have have good
-PRON- have a burger and -PRON- be cook perfect;y
most review say -PRON- need to have breakfast which -PRON- do_not
the portion be a lot and -PRON- be not expensive
service be not the great however -PRON- be by -PRON- so maybe there be no need to constantly check
-PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- selection however when look_at seriously spend money the sale guy be very pushy on get -PRON- to buy something
most_likely because -PRON- work on commision which -PRON- understand
however -PRON- feel_like -PRON- would tell -PRON- anything to get a sale
like -PRON- say great stuff and selection just do_not like pushy sale staff
feel more like a car dealer than a music shop
bit of a turn_off for -PRON-
-PRON- go to celebrity tanning after buy a live social deal for two spray tans
-PRON- walk_in the front_desk brunette ask what color -PRON- want light medium or dark
-PRON- say dark and -PRON- say that will be $_7 dollar
-PRON-
ok why
-PRON- tell -PRON- the deal be for light and the medium be $_5 and the dark be $_7 can anyone tell -PRON- why that make since
-PRON- would have walk_out but -PRON- be -PRON- birthday
that day
so -PRON- need the tan for -PRON- party
-PRON- continue to go over every other option with more upgrade and -PRON- decline
so -PRON- pay -PRON- $ 7.91 and go in the room
-PRON- explain_how to use the booth and leave
-PRON- get undressed and
what do -PRON- know
the lotion be almost completely go
-PRON- get out what i could
but -PRON- leave -PRON- foot and palm completely orange when -PRON- be all do
thanks
-PRON- get home and look_at -PRON- live social deal and
no where on the deal do -PRON- say -PRON- charge -PRON- for medium of dark tan
-PRON- call live social and still a week_later -PRON- be try to get celebrity tanning to work something out with -PRON-
-PRON- have another tan to use
but -PRON- would never_go_back to this_company again
-PRON- will stick to dolce
-PRON- be there for father 's day lunch with -PRON- family
good food and location be great
service continue to be an_issue
slow never clear dirty plate until -PRON- want to get pay
lot_of young help stand around and talk or check -PRON- cell_phone
-PRON- ask for a second beer and the original beer -PRON- order the keg kick
the second beer -PRON- order the keg kick
then when -PRON- order bottled beer -PRON- do_not get until -PRON- be do with -PRON- meal
just spend 4 day at bally 's and eat_here_twice
great food the spicy dumpling on the menu be amazing
great noodle
service be fast and efficient
be open_late which make -PRON- a great place to get a late_night bite after lose at card
-PRON- will_definitely be back next_time -PRON- be in_vegas
so -PRON- be crave some raman from monta but do_not feel_like drive all the way to chinatown or wait a long_time just to get in
well good news monta fan
-PRON- open up another location and the wait be not as crazy as the original location
the location seem far especially if -PRON- be not in the area but really for the long waiting time at the original location -PRON- could still drive to this_location eat and leave in less time actually -PRON- do that once even stop_by the original location before -PRON- be tell the wait be over_an_hour
the menu be make up of a variety_of raman and non raman item
-PRON- have not have any of -PRON- non raman item because -PRON- be a raman place
for the raman -PRON- start with one of 4 base raman selection tonkotsu shoyu tonkotsu shoyu and miso and then add extra item to -PRON- if -PRON- want extra pork egg nori corn etc for an_extra charge
the base raman selection be not price to bad but add more extra really do add up
plus -PRON- have a $_10 minimum for credit_card
so -PRON- may have to add extra item
-PRON- think the shoyu and tonkotsu shoyu be very salt to -PRON- liking
and so -PRON- do_not ever order -PRON- anymore but the tonkotsu and miso with a lot_of extra item add
-PRON- even have a spicy tonkotsu and another raman that be show off the regular menu
some may say taste be different from here and the original location but to -PRON- -PRON- taste about the same to -PRON- even may like -PRON- here more
just in case -PRON- be wonder here -PRON- order -PRON- tonkotsu or miso_raman with extra pork egg corn and some spice and shoyu -PRON- add in -PRON- from the table
not bad
-PRON- be a decent substitute when -PRON- can_not make -PRON- to -PRON- favorite raman place
and if -PRON- add more -PRON- would be to much for a bowl of raman
the interior be nice and spacious compare to the original location
the parking situation here be a lot good also
customer_service and speed besides the initial wait time to get seat be about the same
-PRON- be not a huge_fan_of monta in_general
but -PRON- will enjoy a bowl here now and then
a lot_of people love monta and say -PRON- be the good
-PRON- do_not_know about that
-PRON- be good but enough for a 3.5 from -PRON-
the food be absolutely fantastic
-PRON- bf and -PRON- go_back within 24_hour
the uber burger and the euro burger be soooo yummy
-PRON- highly_recommend medium cook
the garlic parmesan fry be fresh and perfectly garnished
however as for the service -PRON- be not up to standard gordon ramsey would approve of
the first_time -PRON- go within that 24_hour -PRON- get a host that sneeze into -PRON- arm do_not check if -PRON- need any refill
the second_time -PRON- bf and -PRON- say let -PRON- give the place another try since the food be outstanding
-PRON- understand that when a restaurant be full not all waiter can provide as much customer_service
in_fact -PRON- love how -PRON- waiter give -PRON- an orange cover ipad to look over drink and so forth
what -PRON- do_not expect be the tablet do_not work well
this be something -PRON- bf and -PRON- write off since electronic can glitch
however when -PRON- waiter take -PRON- order and do_not even listen to -PRON- request for drink well -PRON- be not go to get a good tip
the manager come to -PRON- table and be super_nice
-PRON- be not go to make a fuss since -PRON- be already annoy but when the manager ask -PRON- how -PRON- be do and if -PRON- be enjoy -PRON- -PRON- be very honest and tell -PRON- that the food be fantastic and the chef be very talented
however -PRON- also tell the manager that -PRON- waiter be busy talk with 4 other waiter where -PRON- place order and be in clear view of the public
-PRON- be one thing if the waiter be busy and need assistance with a tablet to cover more ground for order but -PRON- be another when the waiter hang_out and do_not bring -PRON- -PRON- drink
-PRON- just want sugar for -PRON- ice_tea and -PRON- bf want a whisky sour
the waiter keep ignore -PRON- numerous_time
-PRON- be actually surprise that the manager after check in with -PRON- who by the way be super_nice do_not offer a free drink or something for be so neglect by a waiter
in essence food be great and -PRON- will be go_back for more burger but -PRON- now know not to expect good customer_service since the two time -PRON- go be the two time the service suck
-PRON- 100 know gordon ramsey would have rip the waiter a new one if -PRON- know_how negative the review continue to be for the customer_service realm
food wise gr would be proud as -PRON- should be
-PRON- experience with bmw of henderson be nothing short of amazing
so professional and for communicative when -PRON- come to any_question or concern -PRON- may have
-PRON- be send -PRON- direction through usaa and find exactly_what -PRON- be look for at such a great price
-PRON- use the online quote system where -PRON- be contact by justin who then have -PRON- take_care_of
justin and brian be able_to have -PRON- in and out with the car -PRON- want in two day
thank -PRON- justin brian b. and bmw of henderson for -PRON- service and professionalism
-PRON- recommend bmw of henderson for everyone
sometimes write be therapeutic in end a relationship
spoken aloud the name put a grimace on -PRON- face as once speak with great joy now evoke deep regret
for the last 4 month -PRON- have have permutation of this conversation with -PRON- wife
hmmm -PRON- do_not really feel_like cooking
-PRON-
well -PRON- could order delivery
wife
face begin to morph into the why do -PRON- put up with -PRON- face
-PRON- could
orrrrrrrrrrrrr -PRON- could wok in
ahahahahaha
-PRON-
why do -PRON- marry -PRON-
wife
well if -PRON- need to -PRON- can always wok out ahahahahaha
-PRON-
the glare
wife
with heart afloat with punny happiness -PRON- approach this chinese_restaurant call wok in
situate prominently on the corner of sossaman and main
a tinge of trepidation shake -PRON- as -PRON- note that -PRON- signage have only a single letter work
eating at o be not as fun as wok in but -PRON- figure the food should be what concern -PRON-
walk up some step that -PRON- kindly warn -PRON- about -PRON- enter and the restaurant feel spacious probably can seat 120-ish
pretty worn decor but no point off for that
momentary confusion as -PRON- have a order counter but also full service seating
nice server with very cheerful disposition seat and take drink order which be ice_tea which arrive very promptly
-PRON- decide to try -PRON- egg_drop_soup goi cuon and bun cha gio thit nuong
-PRON- do_not quite remember but -PRON- want to say everything be $_2 except the bun which be around $_7
after order the server ask -PRON- if -PRON- be vietnamese
sure be
clouds pass over the previously unrelenting sunny disposition as -PRON- swiftly depart to place -PRON- order
surprised -PRON- take another look around -PRON- surrounding and note the absence of any of -PRON- people
know many caucasian with excellent taste in asian cuisine -PRON- shrug off the demographic and tell -PRON- everything will be okay
egg_drop_soup arrive very promptly
-PRON- tolerable
less eggy than_most but with lot_of carrot corn some cabbage flavor be a_bit weak but veggie redeem -PRON- slightly
goi cuon much_more disappointing
stuffed with a lot_of lettuce bean_sprout and 3 shrimp between the 2 roll
no pork
the sauce be pure bottled hoisin with some sprinkled peanut on_top
then -PRON- favorite cool noodle_dish bun cha gio thit nuong
normally this be a bright herbaceous dish with slippery rice_noodle lot_of herbs\/veggie and savory pork slice grill + egg_roll
the cha gio fry egg_roll be really tasty and grill beef be nice enough but the fish sauce be very watery and lettuce be probably 30 of the volume of this dish
some good bit to this dish but overall unbalanced and depressing with the weak nuoc mam
well
time to walk up and pay for -PRON- food
server timidly ask if -PRON- like the food
-PRON- get an unconvincing yea
-PRON- be fine
-PRON- can tell and quietly say goodbye
-PRON- say
good bye as_well
good
bye to the server
good bye to a fun
pun that -PRON- can_not use anymore as -PRON- just depressing to think of good bye to a chinese_restaurant with vietnamese owner who make bad viet food
good bye to -PRON- all
-PRON- wok out
customer_service here be the absolute bad
management seriously need to get some people with some personality and regard for customer who be patronizing
smoothie be almost always inconsistent
let -PRON- not even begin to talk_about the sandwich
-PRON- have no care in the world how -PRON- food come_out
lettuce be always old bread be always cut wrong and put on the sandwich backwards
-PRON- believe if -PRON- be to be a customer in -PRON- own establishment -PRON- would be just as irritated and upset as patron
bad possible location to visit
-PRON- will happily drive 15_minute pass this_location which be near -PRON- home for good customer_service and beverage
this be one of those airport where even if -PRON- be -PRON- first_time in_vegas -PRON- will know -PRON- be vegas from the moment -PRON- set foot in the airport
slot machine galore at the gate and flashy ad on big_screen at the baggage claim
yessir -PRON- be in_vegas
-PRON- be just such a loooong walk to get to the baggage claim and go to -PRON- gate
plan_ahead for extra time especially_during peak hour
verizon be frustratingly slow and terribly expensive
welcome to near monopoly status
to top -PRON- off must navigate past striking worker
get the picture knowledgeable efficient employee get sympathy can get sympathy in a strike
far_from the case here
do_not think this be a well manage company either
why can_not verizon cell and fio talk
like to get just one bill
add to this review the fact_that -PRON- have to use the work internet across the street to post this addendum should fortify the reason for -PRON- score
perhaps yelp should really think about allow 0_star score
be happy with dr. gulzeth when -PRON- examine -PRON- cat
the wait time be minimal
-PRON- would be bring -PRON- cat back to this facility
but -PRON- will be move out of the area soon
-PRON- would_recommend this veterinarian to someone_else
oh m g try the drunken goat
-PRON- will not miss that there be not any traditional protein
-PRON- be so flavorful
the bread be amazing
husband have the steak sandwich and -PRON- be great too
highly_recommend
be impressed_by the wait staff and manager
customer experience be as important to -PRON- as the food
wonderful ambiance too
berrrrrrry saladddddd~
hehe follow claire on instagram go with a_few yelper on a friday_night with comped ticket thank to mary rose
-PRON- man and -PRON- be run a few_minute late but -PRON- still stop for drink at the showroom bar $_20 for a beer and an_extra strong crown diet and the usher be not rude about -PRON- at all and show -PRON- to -PRON- table
-PRON- would say a pro about this show be that there really be not any bad seat in the house since the theatre be not too large
-PRON- think -PRON- be really cute how the show be set_up to follow the month of the calendar
-PRON- enjoy the live band and all of the dancer be very talented as_well_as the lead singer who stop to play with -PRON- hair in one of the act lolol
-PRON- favorite act include the one on the stripper pole and the one with the swing dancer
the show do_not show as much skin as -PRON- think -PRON- be go to
but -PRON- be still very sexy
apparently claire even give -PRON- yelpers an_extra special something by flash -PRON- with some pasty http:\/\/www.lasvegassun.com\/blogs\/kat report\/2013\/jun\/25\/it girl night out----least one show----claire si\/#axzz2yurbjroy
-PRON- would compare this show to peepshow at ph main difference be that -PRON- be not as risqué
-PRON- be hop claire have more scene in the show but that be to be expect -PRON- guess
over all
-PRON- think the show be very cute and -PRON- even have -PRON- want to dress up like a pin up gal~ hot tip
although -PRON- enjoy the show -PRON- be not too sure -PRON- would pay_$ 50 + for -PRON- so use a company like tix 4 tonight to get discount ticket ~
go online and check_out -PRON- weekly special such_as $_15 lobster_tail night on_tuesday and dozen mussel for $_2 on sundays
-PRON- love the food here really a great place right outside downtown cleveland
the broth from the mussel be delicious -PRON- could fill_up on the soak bread alone
sundays order of mussel be only a dozen
but if -PRON- order -PRON- off the menu for $ 9.50 -PRON- get a shi ton_of -PRON-
nice big bar with seating everywhere
service be top_notch beer be cold wine option vary in a good way and the drink -PRON- have be good and stiff
this_place fall right in line with the kind_of bar restaurant -PRON- love go to and be just as excited to hear_about other visit to don 's
bring the family there or pony up to the bar good time will be have by all
this_place be friggin amazing
-PRON- have be back a_few time over the past_few week cuz everything on -PRON- menu be super fire
the spice rub steak chilaquile be by_far -PRON- favorite
get the pot of bread w\/ that and ask for a side of the cream_cheese sauce if -PRON- be feelin kinky
cinnabunstatus
the vibe in the restaurant be pretty dope too
the server rock -PRON- jammie 's be super_friendly
if ya get a hankering for some killer steak egg this be a no brainer
this_place be absolutely_horrible
-PRON- purchase this deal on groupon and make a reservation for 4 get there and wait at_least 5_min to be acknowledge
as_soon_as the hostess bring -PRON- to -PRON- table there be only 3 other party in there
not busy at all
the ambiance be blah -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be in a denny_'s and not a nice brazilian steakhouse
there salad_bar be not the good of quality quite frankly -PRON- think -PRON- purchase the item from the deli
the grocery_store and put -PRON- out not much effort in -PRON-
the fruit salad at the end of the bar be can fruit the meat be cold dry and flavorless
wait let -PRON- take that back majority_of -PRON- meat taste_like metal possibly from the skewer
-PRON- boyfriend order an ice_tea and that taste_like poison -PRON- have to share 2 huge tong among 4_people and when the guy with the meat come to -PRON- table -PRON- never walk_around the table to each party -PRON- be always reach over or have someone_else reach across to get the food to -PRON-
the grill pineapple be way over cooked along_with the meat
service be not that great there be a long_wait time in between the meat and -PRON- decide to end -PRON- meal as_soon_as -PRON- be do with the bottle_of wine and as -PRON- be walk_out the host have the audacity to bring -PRON- a bill charge -PRON- tax and a mandatory gratuity of 18 for a party of 4
let -PRON- remind -PRON- this be purchase through groupon
the deal be dinner for 4 and a bottle_of wine for $ 132
nowhere in the fine print on groupon
do -PRON- state that -PRON- would get hit with tax and a mandatory gratuity
the lady never mention any of this at the beginning and -PRON- do_not see anything post about that until -PRON- be walk_out and -PRON- stop -PRON- by the bar with the bill
at that time be when -PRON- point out the mandatory gratuity on a sign at the back of the bar
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- would have even leave 15 of a tip after that experience
-PRON- have never have to pay tax on a meal that be set in stone like that
-PRON- have pay tax if the deal be something like $_10 for $_20 worth of food and -PRON- go over
only then have -PRON- have to come_out of pocket
if -PRON- be look for a nice atmosphere great service and meat that be burst with flavor among flavor and tender juicy meat -PRON- should check_out via brasil
that be definitely -PRON- go to and will_continue to be -PRON- go to when -PRON- be crave a brazilian steakhouse
absolutely_love that place
terrible keep walk
order the bunless fish burger and receive a burn fish stick reminiscent of a captain highliner product on warm rusty lettuce with tartar sauce as a dress onion_ring be onion string clearly reheat in a microwave
on of -PRON- kid order mac and cheese which be at good soupy
all for a ridiculous price
look_like a great place to work
staff blast music and enjoying socializing ignore customer
keep walk -PRON- will find something good and cheap
have a great experience with everyone at granite dude
from the initial phone_call where jill explain the process to meet with josh to pick out -PRON- granite and sink to the day of installation everything be clear the process be easy and -PRON- do exactly_what -PRON- say -PRON- would
-PRON- love -PRON- kitchen counter
the installation team be fast and efficient and -PRON- recommendation to run the granite up behind the faucet into the window sill be a good one
-PRON- be super thrilled
these_guy be great
if -PRON- like quality work and a smooth experience granite dude be the way to go
very happy and would definitely use -PRON- again
-PRON- just move here from fl
not know where to go -PRON- try many salon
everyone do a terrible job
-PRON- go to blis salon jerry do -PRON- color and cut
-PRON- do_an_amazing job
-PRON- do_not need to look any further because jerry be the only one -PRON- will let touch -PRON- hair anymore
-PRON- take_pride_in -PRON- work which mean -PRON- walk_away look great
whatev -PRON- do
do_not book through a 3rd party entity and have a death in the family and have to cancel
the cancelation policy give to -PRON- at booking and the hotel cancellation policy do_not seem to match up
so -PRON- be be charge a $_200 + cancelation fee and not be refund
cancel 2 day prior to -PRON- reservation
-PRON- would have assume some kind_of understanding may be extend
guess not
the compass be a beacon of warmth and good food on a cold edinburgh night
-PRON- wander in accidentally when shelter from a bite wind
both hungry -PRON- settle to eat
large sturdy wooden table greet -PRON-
a fire be glow
friendly_staff smile and effortlessly glide in and out of view at all the right time
-PRON- be well on -PRON- way to one of the most enjoyable experience of the trip
this be simply a lovely place to be
-PRON- serve fresh tasty well_prepared thoughtful food
go be impress by the price and the quality
-PRON- be a joy
great service and amazing food
along_with a ton_of american craft_beer to_choose_from what can be good
if -PRON- have not be here -PRON- need to check -PRON- out
try the truffle_fry tender and date as_an_appetizer
thank -PRON- later
scam
scam
scam
do_not rent from here
if -PRON- do decide to rent from -PRON- make_sure to ask about all the extra_charge add to -PRON- total paperwork before sign or initialing anything
-PRON- charge -PRON- for insurance even when -PRON- specifically ask not to insure -PRON- over and over because -PRON- have full coverage
in the end after plead -PRON- case with the manager -PRON- be nice enough to split the insurance cost
the extra_charge run -PRON- 3x more_than the car rental charge
so a $ 55 total car rental come_out over $_200 with all the add charge
total rip
right
-PRON- will nickel and dime -PRON- for everything

the decor be dark lot_of wood stain dark and look fairly old -PRON- be not
the bar_area be fun and a place to drink or have some food in a noisier setting near the entrance

those room be pretty pleasant and safe
a solarium room be the third environment
the light and sight of the strip can be see outside the glass but -PRON- be still indoor temperature control

dont waste your time or money
stay on the main strip and stay_away_from the palm

-PRON- would not say -PRON- the very good spanish tapas -PRON- can have but -PRON- be certainly very good value
the restaurant be locate on charlotte street which be just between princess street and charlotte square so -PRON- really handy for anyone in the west end
-PRON- sometimes have a lunchtime offer on too which be great value for money
the only_negative be the small table but -PRON- think that be pretty standard for tapas restaurant

kassie be awesome
-PRON- knowledge and customer_service have restore -PRON- hope at_this_location
5_star for great customer_service and efficiency
-PRON- highly_recommend this_location for -PRON- wireless need
enjoy
-PRON- know -PRON- know
after all the bad review why
because -PRON- like to form -PRON- own opinion
and there have not be a review in a long_time
so -PRON- order the white pizza and -PRON- be just a ton_of cheese
-PRON- could_not taste the ricotta at all
the cheese stick be cold which make -PRON- hard and the bread super crumbly
not good quality
the 2_star be for be here in a timely_manner
the store be great but -PRON- attract the rudest people in_las_vegas
while walk down an aisle -PRON- get shove into the display flip off and tell to f off for walk too_far in the middle and this be all say to -PRON- by a woman about -PRON- age
-PRON- wonder_if -PRON- would have be so rude if -PRON- have not be alone -PRON- have not have two man with -PRON-
honestly -PRON- be be a long_time
but -PRON- be very tempt to grab -PRON- by the shirt teach -PRON- some courtesy
firstly crossfit rock
a fitness routine that incorporate a dynamic range of movement from burpee to pull_up to olympic weightlifting movement to sprinting
-PRON- pretty_much encapsulate various aspect of fitness and tightly pack -PRON- into 1 hr class
if -PRON- be really look to jump start -PRON- health physique and overall athletic ability -PRON- should look no further than crossfit
hmm -PRON- sound a little brainwash do_not -PRON-
well try -PRON- and -PRON- will get brainwash too
just to let -PRON- a_bit of -PRON- background pertain to this fitness be an important part of -PRON- life
-PRON- make -PRON- mandatory to exercise frequently and a lot_of -PRON- extra curricular activity be physical volleyball dragon boat adventure racing
-PRON- have go_through a whole 90 day with p90x and see some decent result
but -PRON- want to push -PRON- further and crossfit seem_like a perfect fit
location
what attract -PRON- most be the location of this gym
most of the crossfit gym be downtown but this one be the only one -PRON- have find that be more uptown
that alone make this gym a solid choice for those look to try -PRON- out but do_not live downtown facility
like most crossfit gym the main element require empty space with pull_up bar on the wall ring hang from the ceiling olympic barbells\/dumbell and medicine ball
this gym be not fully equip like a goodlife with elliptical machine or exercise machine because that be not really what the sport entail
there be one washroom no shower and individual change room that be very well_maintain
overall the gym be very clean despite have that garage gym feel which be super cool
-PRON- can tell how_much a gym owner care by how well -PRON- maintain the facility and -PRON- be pristine(ye as a crossfit tradition -PRON- be suppose to collapse to the floor after workout and this floor be very clean
-PRON- be a_bit small in comparison to the like of crossfitto but be okay for the average class size 5 8
classes\/membership
this gym run on the instructional class methodology with room for specialize program once -PRON- have become familiar_with proper form
like any sport there be skill that need to be teach properly to avoid injury and ensure proper muscle development
-PRON- can_not count the number_of time -PRON- have see people in the gym lift big weight but with really bad form
sure -PRON- be an ego thing and -PRON- be like that too but no more
have instructional class allow for injury prevention and proper muscle development
as class be typically not that large 5 8 people per hour the trainer be able_to assist everyone
class usually be compose of a strength development component and a metabolic conditioning part more cardio esque but with weight sometimes and last about an hour.(no more of that 2.5 hour at the gym nonsense
everyone try to motivate each_other during the workout and the trainer be always be vocal and push -PRON- along
these class be ideal for those_who do_not have much time for the gym but want a workout that be short but high intensity
trust -PRON- -PRON- do_not want to work out anymore after just 1 hr here unless -PRON- be crazy
trainer could_not ask for good bunch_of people
-PRON- pay_attention to -PRON- specific need and suggest thing
-PRON- scale\/modify workout to -PRON- own ability
-PRON- provide -PRON- with nutritional advice
-PRON- be constantly take course to better -PRON- understanding of fitness and mobility
-PRON- definitely challenge -PRON- but do_not make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- do_not belong
the culture foster in this gym be definitely one where -PRON- can make friend and have social gathering if -PRON- feel so inclined
overall just a great facility overall
as -PRON- will update with a link in the future this gym be vote good fitness gym in_toronto by the now magazine reader
will post link when available
that alone be a statement in -PRON-
please do_not be hesitant to try -PRON- out because -PRON- think -PRON- be not fit enough
like -PRON- say before the trainer pay specific attention to everyone and will appropriate workout accord to -PRON- own ability so that -PRON- still feel challenge but not push over the edge
-PRON- have to start somewhere and when -PRON- do this gym will help -PRON- see improvement like -PRON- have never imagine
-PRON- have be to fiamma twice and both visit be during restaurant week
from the outside -PRON- be very unimpressed
-PRON- be locate_in a strip_mall that offer no pzazz
once inside however the ambiance be intimate warmly light and romantic
most of the table be separate but there be a_few that be connect by one long booth seat
unfortunately this be where -PRON- party of 3 be sit
even more uncomfortable be that the table be actually comprise of 2 separate small table cover by a table cloth
-PRON- be notably a tight space
thankfully -PRON- overcome -PRON- discourage seating situation by order wine
the pour be generous and the price_range from $ 6.00 to $_9.00 per glass
-PRON- be quite reasonable
in_addition to some wine -PRON- also order food off of the restaurant week menu
-PRON- first item be sauteed sea scallop in a cauliflower puree top with mushroom
-PRON- be simply delectable
-PRON- would order this as an entree if -PRON- could
-PRON- second item be a pacific white fish serve with two sauteed potato and white asparagus cover in a caper sauce
-PRON- be a nice dish
but -PRON- do_not knock -PRON- off -PRON- foot
-PRON- feel the fish could have be a_bit_more moist but the flavor be tasty
lastly -PRON- all order and sample each_other dessert
the creme_brulee take the first place ribbon
-PRON- be a generous_portion top with delicious berry
the ricotta cheesecake be a runner up
-PRON- be light and do the trick to hit -PRON- sweet spot
however if -PRON- be a cheesecake lover and like the rich creamy version this would not be -PRON- pick
the service -PRON- receive be adequate but not superb
-PRON- have a much good waiter the first_time -PRON- visit
there be a_few time -PRON- find -PRON- eye wander to see if -PRON- could get -PRON- attention
additionally only 2 out of the 3 entree be bring_out together
one of -PRON- friend have to wait a few_minute before -PRON- arrive
-PRON- certainly do_not ruin the meal
but -PRON- be always nice begin eat -PRON- dinner at the same time
overall fiamma do_not earn a 5_star review
but -PRON- would return
-PRON- enjoy the atmosphere and -PRON- have some great dish
there be just some area that could be tweak to make the overall experience more enjoyable
-PRON- love everything about barney 's of new_york
all the employee be very_friendly
especially genevieve the sale associate who help -PRON- with -PRON- purchase
-PRON- be very knowledgable and personable
do_not rush -PRON- at all when -PRON- be decide on what perfume -PRON- want to purchase
-PRON- also help -PRON- pick out some chanel makeup and make_sure that -PRON- have the right color of foundation to match -PRON- skin tone
-PRON- be so happy with -PRON- purchase
will surely come_back and see -PRON- again for future purchase
thank -PRON- genevieve
the only good thing -PRON- have to say be that be a very classy place good food friendly_staff
-PRON- happen to have go there on april 30th saturday with buddy of mine and -PRON- have a jazz band playing
now the problem be -PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- be a band member or some one from the restaurant but this person give a big speach on the mic how that this club do_not have a cover charge so that -PRON- be mandatory to tip the band this person go table to table with a tip jar and a debit machine want tip
-PRON- do believe that the band be pay to play there and that -PRON- should never be force or bully into tipping so -PRON- would go for the food and stay_away on jazz night
so -PRON- do_not get bully into tipping
-PRON- have a lot_of great product but -PRON- be incredibly over price
-PRON- buy the same stuff down the street at marche nuvo for half the price
also -PRON- buy a rice ball from there and there be a long female hair in the ball
-PRON- go right through -PRON-
-PRON- bring the ball back and instead_of take ownership -PRON- deny that -PRON- be -PRON- hair and beat around the bush when clearly the hair go_through the entire ball
-PRON- be not on_top
-PRON- sanitary procedure to -PRON- be quite questionable now
-PRON- live right next_door
but -PRON- refuse to go_back
cute inside
super small_portion for big cost in comparison never again for food drink menu be big then food menu may try that but can_not afford to eat there and get full
lukewarm bottle_of water sit on table -PRON- order water often)-no ice go in nice weather -PRON- have garage_door as wall and have open bug and bird fly around yuck

-PRON- get a two scoop with half brown_rice half salad salmon and yellowtail house spicy sauce all the topping and sesame_seed
everything taste very fresh especially the fish
there be too_much dress on the salad unfortunately as the flavor blow -PRON- taste_bud out from taste too_much salty sauce
overall -PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal though
-PRON- also order a thai iced_tea which be a perfect_amount of sweetness and lightly creamy tasting
the price for the bowl be $ 8.95 and the tea be $ 2.99
-PRON- think -PRON- be a decent value for -PRON- money

-PRON- will be back to try more custom creation

perfect place to stop and relax
this_place be amazing
-PRON- will_never go to another
all -PRON- can eat sushi restaurant .we've be there over 20 time always have consistency with the food experience
the fish be always fresh green mussel be amazing
the all -PRON- can eat menu be very large
yummy yummy
come in on a saturday_afternoon for a quick snack of what have be advertise as the good sushi in_town but be totally underwhelmed
the service be slow and limit the server keep disappear for long period of time
the sushi selection be not good at all most roll contain either cream_cheese ew or tempura
-PRON- find a roll that seem_like -PRON- would be ok the tom tom and -PRON- be tiny and flavorless for $_17
the spicy_tuna_roll be not spicy at all
the sashimi be the only decent part the tuna be ok the octopus be average and the salmon be good
-PRON- be not expect tsukiji fish market quality roll but -PRON- also do_not expect crap
mid sized restaurant that fill_up very quickly even on a week night -PRON- be a party of 9 and -PRON- have arrive_early 6pm -PRON- reservation a must),was for 6:30,by 7 the place be already full
-PRON- waiter be very_attentive courteous and informative but unintrusive which be always good
-PRON- order be take without much ado since no one want drink but the appetiser be a_bit slow coming;since so_many include pork which -PRON- do_not eat -PRON- pass but -PRON- companion seem to enjoy -PRON-
next -PRON- each order -PRON- famous pizza -PRON- order the siciliana which be -PRON- basic tomato and cheese with eggplant
there certainly be the two aforementioned ingredient but not much in the way of eggplant just a_few chunk and the crust be a teeny bit under cook
-PRON- companion have the margaritha essentially the same_thing without the eggplant -PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- one order with extra cheese another with extra oil and garlic extra_charge too
for dessert -PRON- get a choice of gelato biscotti or tiramisu -PRON- just opt_for cappuccino but four of -PRON- companion ordered;one mistook the choice of biscotti as one choice but be very surprised when -PRON- get a platter of biscotti all different choice
the two who order the tiramisu be also surprised when -PRON- come on a platter with not one but three cake
the gelato guy be probably the only one who get shortchang here as -PRON- serving although generous be not enough for three people
as pizza go good but not exceptional dessert copious cappuccino very good service excellent price not cheap but will not break -PRON- bank account either
small menu but the one on the menu be really good
make_sure -PRON- try the wonton noodle
selfserve water\/tea
cheap and quick
ok so what if -PRON- be an authentic 1950s ice_cream parlor
the stuff -PRON- be scoop up be bore major brand name label ice_cream full of air and the topping be nothing_special
and the wallpaper be dirty and fade
and the carnival esque decor be kinda creepy unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here star sadly off into space as -PRON- ice_cream soda melt away
-PRON- can almost imagine the opening scene of a tear jerker lifetime movie set here
that be not good
offer a nice cozy atmosphere
-PRON- have be here a handful of time and have never be disappoint
food be always exceptional
-PRON- sit_at the bar
-PRON- order duck in the can poutine and cherry foie_gra
all be good the foie_gra be exceptional
sit_at the bar -PRON- have a great view of the kitchen
this turn_out to take_away_from the experience
-PRON- note the unsanitary habit of one kitchen staff
e.g. use the same cutting board for both meat and tomato for -PRON- burger
wiping the board with a towel which -PRON- then keep wrap around -PRON- neck
the waitress be nice and helpful
a_bit slow in the end
overall a good experience bc the food be good
-PRON- be so_glad to have a great wine and cheese shop in ahwatukee
-PRON- have quality product the staff know -PRON- stuff and the wine tastings\/class be great
-PRON- have to start this with the fact_that -PRON- be not partial to eastern european food
-PRON- sit a_bit heavy and greasy to -PRON- liking
so -PRON- review may be slightly bias
still when in rome -PRON- try some of the pierogis
-PRON- be all prepare as_well_as can be
moist rich filling
-PRON- have fresh filling and the dough be still moist
as good as -PRON- could possibly be

in the style of other quality fast_food burger joint like 5 guy inn out burger dare -PRON- say bobby 's burger palace

the chocolate pot be phenomenal
-PRON- server be extremely_friendly and the food be adequate
-PRON- have recommend that -PRON- split an_appetizer and a $_13 entrée and -PRON- turn_out to be enough to share for lunch
-PRON- appreciate -PRON- tip
-PRON- seem to do good business with the south point visitor come from across the way
the environment be definitely casual to austere
the lamb be very_tasty -PRON- must_say
this be one of -PRON- absolute_favorite place to eat now
-PRON- recently adopt a vegan lifestyle and there be not many vegan friendly restaurant near where -PRON- live
-PRON- have come_here twice_now
-PRON- have love -PRON- each_time
the owner be so nice and friendly
-PRON- recommend the hola amigo hot_dog with the california vegan hot_dog option
both the fry and the vegan potato_salad be delicious
this be a great place to go when -PRON- be crave a hot_dog
craft dogs host a preview party tonight and will open to the public on_tuesday may 28th
should -PRON- line up for one of -PRON- haute dog
yes -PRON- should
follow what could be call a burger movement in_toronto -PRON- seem almost natural to move on to -PRON- fast_food counterpart and give -PRON- the much need makeover
and craft dogs do just that
imagine everything -PRON- think -PRON- know about hot_dog and throw -PRON- out the window
first_off the hot_dog be hand craft and contain only natural ingredient even the casing
yup all natural
most if not all of the condiment and drink less the beer -PRON- presume be make in house too
if -PRON- love -PRON- lemonade like -PRON- do go for the simple yet why aren't more people do this maple syrup version
second the mainstay be crazy
in a good way
everything from duck to pork_belly to kobe_beef be dress to impress
one standout be the thai dog top with a mango salsa but -PRON- hear the avocado dog be equally as good
finally do -PRON- work in the financial district and tire of the corporate culture trickle down into the restaurant offering
escape here and eat well
shout_out to the owner kathleen and brian who follow the success of -PRON- now sell beer bistro clearly know_what this city crave in food and drink

good shred company in az by_far
-PRON- can count on this team to get all -PRON- shred need do
this restaurant be exactly_what montreal need more of
-PRON- be a huge_fan
everything be delicious homey and satisfying
-PRON- particular favourite be the perogie pancake cobb salad and mcarthur 's sandwich
great coffee
only drawback be this_place be small mean -PRON- be usually pack on the weekend and guest be practically sit on_top_of one another so definitely expect a wait and be in the mood to speak loudly get cozy
however if -PRON- live in the area foodora deliver from arthur 's which be a great alternative in a pinch
tip never ever leave without order a babka
-PRON- be not_sure -PRON- be even on the menu but -PRON- need -PRON-
get both chocolate and cinnamon
-PRON- will not regret -PRON-
definitely a fan
-PRON- be great have a place around the corner that -PRON- can get all -PRON- work stuff do at
the good thing -PRON- like about this store be that the employee actually try to get to know -PRON- and help -PRON- with whatever -PRON- need
whenever -PRON- come in -PRON- have a copy key and ups envelope wait for -PRON- -PRON- be great get that personal service
-PRON- wife and -PRON- order from here every now
and then when -PRON- be in the mood for chinese
-PRON- have not notice a difference in quality from here to china a go go or even new_york chinese in summerlin
maybe -PRON- be not as much of a chinese_food connoisseur as -PRON- think -PRON- be after_read other people 's review but -PRON- be close to -PRON- house and decently_price
nice food portion too so -PRON- always have leave over which -PRON- think be a plus
absolutely pissed and horrify to find plastic in -PRON- ice_cream
not only be -PRON- a hazard that could break a tooth
but -PRON- be plastic in -PRON- drink
and -PRON- be 8 month pregnant
be u serious who the hell be make these huge mistake
will be call corporate office in the morning
mod home be a cool place if -PRON- be look for modern duh or eclectic piece -PRON- would not find in a regular furniture store
this_place have something for every style from art decco to fuzzy pillow to minimal modern piece to giant decorative bust -PRON- even have a frame area to order custom picture frame
something be a little far out there like an egg chair from men in black but everything seem to be of high_quality and well do
the sale people be nice not push but also do_not seem to care that -PRON- be there
-PRON- catch one sit on a couch take a selfie as -PRON- walk by and the rest hover by the sale station up front
price be very_reasonable compare to other big box retailer with a very large diverse selection
will_definitely be back if -PRON- need any mod furniture
-PRON- decide to try this out after_read an article
planta burger be almost like a fast_food place where -PRON- line up to order and -PRON- get a number
-PRON- have order the california burger smashed avocado tomatoe queso cheese pickle onion and banana pepper the patty have bean inside
-PRON- do_not enjoy the texture
the bun -PRON- find a bit_dry
if -PRON- select bunless -PRON- will be wrap in lettuce
-PRON- have also order the classic and the crab_cake
out of the three -PRON- think the crab_cake be the good option
all meal come with fry and the fry have spice sprinkle on already
probably will not come_back_again
-PRON- agree with other yelper when -PRON- say that this_place be a solid 3.5_star
this weekend -PRON- be in_town and stay_at the hotel palomar which be a short walk to this restaurant

-PRON- recommend the breakfast club since -PRON- have a variety_of dish and be a close walk
-PRON- decide to go here and have a decent experience
this_place do_not stick out to -PRON-
and -PRON- do_not think -PRON- would personally rush back here anytime_soon if -PRON- find -PRON- back in the area
the portion be generous and the restaurant be large both good thing consider there be plenty_of seat and two people could share an entree
food
3_star
very average overall
-PRON- order a single blueberry pancake and -PRON- order the waffle with granola and fresh berry which -PRON- split as_well_as the monster burrito with both the chile and queso on the side
-PRON- think the waffle be the good item follow_by the pancake and lastly the burrito
the waffle taste pretty_good but -PRON- though that the granola and berry take_away_from the flavor of the waffle -PRON-
if -PRON- be to order -PRON- again -PRON- would opt_for something light
the pancake be good and really big but a little dry
the burrito be in -PRON- opinion terrible
-PRON- only take one bite each and both decide -PRON- be dry and do_not taste that well
definitely ask the server what -PRON- recommend because the waffle be really good
service 4_star
the service be pretty good\/average
not outstanding but also not a bad thing to say about -PRON-
location
5_star conveniently_locate in a nice area of downtown_phoenix

-PRON- have never write a yelp_review before but -PRON- experience be so great
-PRON- feel_like -PRON- should
-PRON- call this morning with a couple question about a spray tan
-PRON- have never get a spray tan before
so -PRON- be a little nervous
all -PRON- question be more then answer and -PRON- feel less nervous about the spray tan
-PRON- walk_in to tan many hour_later and the girl work paige recognize -PRON- from -PRON- call somehow and be so sweet
-PRON- inform -PRON- about product that would benefit -PRON- but be not pushy with sell at all

-PRON- will_definitely be back because of paige
great service
knowledgeable pleasant wait staff
excellent food
no gripe whatsoever
the gorgonzola steak be ridiculously good
scallop scallop
so delicious
this michael minas be a_bit different_than the one in san_francisco
-PRON- offer an a la_carte menu which be more popular and offer a great selection than -PRON- tasting_menu
-PRON- guess more people come for a short dining_experience since taste menu usually average a 3 hour dinner
the tasting_menu offer two choice of a 5 course meal
the scallop and foie_gra appetizer be to die for
fine_dining be know for -PRON- tiny spoon sized yet hardy portion
this dish be fill
two piece_of scallop and foie_gra
the black mussel soufflé be also very hardy and delicious
the tuna tartare with sesame oil be great as_well the sesame oil add just the perfect taste to the tuna
next_time maybe -PRON- will just have a bunch_of appetizer for dinner
the lobster pot pie
-PRON- big than -PRON- stomach
-PRON- can usually chow down but -PRON- could_not get -PRON- to comsume the last two piece
-PRON- make the lobster and -PRON- sauce and veggie in a cooking pot -PRON- then cover the top like a lid with the pie crust
when serve -PRON- cut out the crust to use as a base to -PRON- plate and scoop out the lobster all -PRON- glory onto a dish beautifully do
-PRON- friend and -PRON- have an_awesome time over excellent food
the service here be top_notch
-PRON- have to catch a flight and -PRON- have -PRON- in and out just in time but enough time to enjoy the food
fine restaurant usually have many waiter cater to -PRON- which -PRON- have not always have good experience with since -PRON- get confused and the service then become inconsistent
but the service here be outstanding to say the least
highly_recommend
michael minas definitely put a twist to fine_dining
3_star not because the food suck the food be good but for a restaurant charge top price -PRON- be a 3_star
-PRON- be honestly underwhelm by this restaurant
-PRON- first french haute cuisine in_vegas be at joël robuchon at mgm -PRON- second here at picasso and -PRON- third at guy savoy at caesar 's
picasso be not up to tier compare to these other two $_$ $_$ restaurant in_term_of creativity service and decor
if -PRON- have one fancy place to pick when -PRON- be in_vegas -PRON- do_not think this should be -PRON- choice and here be why
the fact_that -PRON- be in bellagio probably make -PRON- think -PRON- must be the good haute french restaurant in_town may not be true
-PRON- have a prix_fixe menu when -PRON- go there and for -PRON- main_course -PRON- upgrade -PRON- dish for a lot_of extra money for -PRON- wagyu just to try how -PRON- be
not worth the money
-PRON- other two friend be a_bit underwhelmed too
honestly -PRON- could_not even remember exactly_what -PRON- eat
the dining_room be quite dimly lit and maybe that be why -PRON- could_not see well what -PRON- be eat lol
the decor be ok nothing so special that would add to -PRON- dining_experience
what be nice be the balcony by the famous fountain
-PRON- be great for take photo
the service be alright not bad but nowhere close to exceptional
a_few time -PRON- have to look around for attention a big
no no for a high_end restaurant
-PRON- would have not a single doubt go_back to the other two restaurant but definitely not picasso
-PRON- enjoy this quaint little joint and the breakfast be perfect to start the day not too heavy nor light
-PRON- make -PRON- dish unique but do_not venture too_far off
the place be a tight squeeze but all the customer seem to enjoy -PRON- breakfast as_well
be here_several_time before just to hang_out and watch football in the bar_area
-PRON- have some nice furniture set_up in front of a cute fireplace
-PRON- think -PRON- fall_asleep a couple time here
this last_visit
-PRON- come with -PRON- wifey on a thursday_night at 9:30
-PRON- be assume the dining_area close at 9 because the door to that area be lock so -PRON- go into the bar which be 24\/7
-PRON- sit -PRON- at one of the table and flag_down a server
for some odd reason this night -PRON- be crave corned_beef and cabbage preggo maybe
lol which be what bring -PRON- here
-PRON- live literally right_across the street for about 3_year and -PRON- always talk_about check this_place out for the food
why be -PRON- that whenever -PRON- live right_next to something -PRON- always seem to drive right by -PRON- think -PRON- will go there someday since -PRON- live near -PRON- but more_often than not -PRON- never make -PRON- in there
well -PRON- finally do but only take -PRON- 3_year
anyways since -PRON- be late and -PRON- do_not want to eat too_much before go to bed later -PRON- decide to order load potato skins and corn_beef n cabbage
-PRON- plan on share but if -PRON- refer to -PRON- pic the loaded potato skins be a meal in -PRON-
so -PRON- call one of friend to join -PRON- who just happen to be down the street
as -PRON- show_up corned_beef n cabbage come_out
again if -PRON- refer to -PRON- pic -PRON- a decent amount_of food
what actually stand out be the pretzel breadstick that come with -PRON-
this alone will make -PRON- come_back
even if -PRON- do_not like anything at all here just get the pretzel breadstick
-PRON- have never have anything like -PRON- and -PRON- wife agree
-PRON- be very tempt to order some more but already have a lot_of food to deal with
the loaded potato skins be actually not bad
come with sour_cream
as for the corned_beef n cabbage -PRON- think -PRON- be ok as_well
now mind -PRON-
-PRON- be a long_time since -PRON- have have this
so there really be not anything -PRON- could compare -PRON- to
come with some kind_of cubed potato and the cabbage have bit of corned_beef with peppercorn
the ambiance of the place be nice in a creepy way
-PRON- have antique picture of old people on the wall
kind_of remind -PRON- of the eerie painting -PRON- have at the haunted mansion at disneyland
-PRON- wonder_if the dining_room be set_up the same way
service be below_average
once -PRON- get -PRON- food -PRON- think -PRON- server go home because -PRON- do_not see -PRON- any more and the bartender be the only one that come around after a while to refill -PRON- drink
overall -PRON- think the negative cancel out the positive which equal the 3_star rating
freak love this bar\/restaurant
great staff and great food amazing beer
must_try for south scottsdale
outdoor atmosphere be great when the weather be nice
vivian be an -PRON- favorite bartender
-PRON- always love this as a treat to -PRON-
-PRON- be a quick solid go to for a good hearty breakfast
-PRON- almost always go here alone and just walk immediately to the breakfast bar
quick service and within second i always get -PRON- own carafe of coffee
food be always pretty solid here
aim more for the omelet though
-PRON- have get waffle and pancake here
and -PRON- be fine
but -PRON- will probably forget what -PRON- eat after about_an_hour because -PRON- do_not leave an impression
-PRON- go to favorite though be the chili rellano omelet
-PRON- mouth water now just think about -PRON-
slap some hot_sauce on that bad boy
and -PRON- get this cheesy chili egg spicy piece_of deliciousness in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- always go to work and brag about what -PRON- eat after that sucker
give this_place a go
solid service and decent food
-PRON- do_not remember name of -PRON- curry soup maybe ka -PRON- be very good
and -PRON- would try other thing in future
-PRON- sit out front of restaurant so -PRON- never go inside
bad place ever to watch a game
audio up audio down audio up audio down the entire game
who ever complain the loud get -PRON- way with game sound
until the next person complain
food average
this restaurant be just okay
the staff be very_attentive knowledgable and friendly but the food be overprice and mediocre
-PRON- order a burger which would have be good but the onion and lettuce inside taste old and almost rotten
the rest_of the food be alright nothing extraordinary and definitely not worth the price
the overall atmosphere of the place be nice though -PRON- be clean and modern
another hard one to rate for -PRON-
because the fact of the matter be nothing beat the good egg for a simple quick satisfy breakfast
but be there anything special about -PRON-
not even a_little_bit
-PRON- want to give -PRON- 4 because for -PRON- for -PRON- breakfast want -PRON- would be happy to go there every weekend
but -PRON- can_not do that in good conscience for the follow reason
-PRON- be not a place to linger because -PRON- sling -PRON- into a table and throw -PRON- food at -PRON- super quickly
-PRON- also have to honest and say that every_time -PRON- have have lunch there -PRON- be be terrible
for what -PRON- be -PRON- do feel a teeny overprice
and there be zero atmosphere
this be the first_time -PRON- have really agonize over want that half star
-PRON- have get nothing bad to say about the good egg just nothing good
not when there be place like palatte and switch
so for those morning when -PRON- just want to get in and fill -PRON- belly go for -PRON-
-PRON- have the pleasure of dining at the north side cafe on_monday august 19th
the food be delicious ~ -PRON- be very_pleased_with the seared pacific salmon
very gourmet
-PRON- friend really_enjoy the chicken milanese and there be plenty_of -PRON-
-PRON- also partook in a mean drink make by peter the bartender
these drink be well_worth -PRON- $_$ $ ~ -PRON- pineapple margarita be high_quality at a very good price
-PRON- will be sure to return soon
very very good froyo place
-PRON- love that -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- but mix -PRON- own flavor and topping
0.47\/ounce make -PRON- a_bit expensive especially when -PRON- have_no_idea of weight as -PRON- fill -PRON- monstrous cup
-PRON- end_up with over a little over 12 ounce
:x opp
the strawberry\/banana be the fav as -PRON- be not a super tart girl
-PRON- can_not give a review as -PRON- want to try -PRON- cronut
but -PRON- do_not serve -PRON- until 9_a.m.

-PRON- would say -PRON- be wear more of a business casual look
very impressive
-PRON- wife take over and explain what -PRON- be look for mainly bathroom cleaning 3 full bath one with bath tub and separate shower
-PRON- be expect thing to be clean and after inspection -PRON- notice area -PRON- have not even consider be clean look fantastic such_as the base board
-PRON- can get kind_of dirty where the hand towel hang from water drip down and then later collect dust and stuff
honestly the baseboard all look brand_new now
-PRON- also clean the kitchen and all of the appliance include inside the microwave
everything shin bright and clean
-PRON- also have a lot_of tile floor and the mop job -PRON- do be amazing
not a single spot on the floor from stick on food or anything
-PRON- have try on -PRON- own and have to get a scraper or something to get the stuck on food off after a long week of cooking dinner and stuff kid make mess and so on
overall good cleaning service -PRON- have ever have and will for sure be use -PRON- again in the future
wound up here completely by accident
-PRON- can honestly say -PRON- be the great accident -PRON- have ever have
intimate atmosphere but lively great service do_not hold not speak french against -PRON- and the food be out of this_world

-PRON- love_this_place -PRON- be one night when -PRON- be bar hopping

a++
slow than expected service on a late saturday_afternoon
cocktail be delicious and sandwich be not_too_bad
great view if -PRON- grab a back patio seat
cool indie place for comfort_food gyro fry burger in a solid neighborhood
-PRON- order at the counter and -PRON- bring -PRON- to -PRON- table
employee be friendly and efficient
decent selection of beer bottle and draft
not a lot_of seating and -PRON- be somewhat pricey
plenty_of nearby free_parking
-PRON- be give this business 5_star for two reason
one collette be super awesome and sweet
-PRON- be one of those rare breed that exude a positive energy
-PRON- be hard to come by a genuine honest person that be not try to just make a buck off of -PRON-
-PRON- answer_any and all question that -PRON- have be thorough in explain_everything and also help -PRON- feel at_ease despite -PRON- vulnerable position of leave -PRON- eyeball in -PRON- hand literally
well lash but -PRON- eyeball be right there ya_know
-PRON- be super cool lay_back but also maintain -PRON- professionalism by keep the appointment time -PRON- know that should be a give
but -PRON- have have some bad_experience and be extremely fair if -PRON- be late or run behind to not jip -PRON- the time that -PRON- lose
-PRON- be run about 5_minute late on -PRON- second appointment due_to a client but -PRON- give -PRON- the extra 5_minute to be fair
-PRON- really_appreciate that -PRON- be respectful to -PRON- previous client and -PRON- and to the one after by let -PRON- know that -PRON- be run 5_minute late
oh the second reason -PRON- almost forget be that -PRON- be get a lot_of experience and do_an_amazing job on -PRON- lash
-PRON- want to say that -PRON- price be not low but -PRON- pay for what -PRON- get
-PRON- recently_move to a well light and nice studio and -PRON- feel a lot better go here now that -PRON- be get settle at a wonderful salon
the people that run the restaurant be very_friendly and the food be great
the pad_thai be some of the good -PRON- have ever have with the medium heat level -PRON- be perfect
the crab rangoon be crispy and tasty and the tom yum soup be good as_well
-PRON- can be a_bit slow on the service at_this_location but overall who can beat a great wing place like native new yorker
have say that the patio be a joke
do_not bother with that
eat in the bar
much good atmosphere there
great food go in during breakfast hour
and then -PRON- change -PRON- to lunch even better
basically -PRON- have brunch for the price of breakfast
the food be delicious--
-PRON- be give a 4_star because the server take a while to bring -PRON- -PRON- drink and refill
overall the food be worth the money and -PRON- will_definitely be back when -PRON- be in_vegas
sakana on elliot be busy on this friday visit
the waitress be all very_helpful and beautiful and plenty_of -PRON- to serve -PRON-
-PRON- start with some green_tea and edamame
nice size portion on the starter twice the size of ra
for sushi -PRON- have the salmon which be in the style of jiro- salmon lay over the cup sushi rice delicicious!.
then -PRON- move to -PRON- sushi_roll the rainbow_roll be fantastic salmon tuna shrimp guac all very fresh
the california_roll be excellent also
-PRON- have the baked crab roll which -PRON- have to say be not -PRON- favorite suppose to be scallap and crab bake over a cali roll
all in all -PRON- definitely enjoy -PRON- dinner and will return
-PRON- be a 1-person small business
-PRON- become aware of laser specialists a few_year_ago when -PRON- be consider the purchase of an all in one copier\/scanner
lance graciously take the time to discuss -PRON- option with -PRON-
-PRON- be impressed_with -PRON- knowledge professionalism and truth in product
-PRON- have use -PRON- ever since to maintain -PRON- current printer
-PRON- and -PRON- staff provide a great service
this_place keep go downhill
go tonight for the first_time in a while
drink be no_longer include in the price
-PRON- be the one advantage -PRON- have over golden corral
but not anymore
golden corral 's hot food be fresh and much better tasting
old country have a slightly good salad_bar
the bad offender be the carving station
the roast beef be usually a dry out husk
once or twice in the last decade be -PRON- actually pink in the middle
-PRON- guess the chef do_not_know roast beef should not be well do
tonight -PRON- have a coke a small salad some dry out roast beef with mash_potato a piece_of fry_chicken some zucchini some acorn squash and a piece_of pecan pie
not worth $_16
lunch be bad than dinner
crappy pizza grill_cheese sandwich hot_dog etc
-PRON- be one thing to serve cheap slop but when the slop be not even that cheap -PRON- be not worth go anymore
yummm
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be put caffeine or heroin in these icy treat but -PRON- be completely addict
yes -PRON- be a little_pricey consider -PRON- be just ice and syrup
but -PRON- be delicious none the less
other have mention that the staff be rude but in -PRON- experience -PRON- be not exactly charismatic
but -PRON- would not say rude
maybe abrupt be the right word
however every_time -PRON- have go the line of customer practicality go out the door so -PRON- probably do_not have time to show any personality
there be an_old gentleman_who work there who be extremely_friendly and welcoming
.owner perhaps
when -PRON- go make_sure -PRON- ask for a punch card tho because the staff never offer
-PRON- probably buy 20 + ice before -PRON- notice a small sign on the counter offer the card
btw -PRON- fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade be phenomenal
the only_reason -PRON- do_not give 5_star be because -PRON- do_not_accept credit\/debit card
but especially_during these brutal az summer month -PRON- highly_recommend a visit or 2 or 3
-PRON- be in_vegas for vacation with -PRON- 2.5 year_old
-PRON- love -PRON- here especially the water work room
-PRON- also love the tower and slide
-PRON- be in a beautiful area
-PRON- initially go to the old location the new place be much good
-PRON- would_recommend go early since -PRON- fill_up quick
-PRON- leave around 11:30 and the line be out the door
-PRON- five_star rating be for the nap -PRON- daughter take after the museum
this_place be absolutely_amazing
the food and service be great and the ambience be even good
spoke to the owner very_nice gentleman
great experience
the bad slow fast_food dive -PRON- have ever be to wait 20_min to order as the cashier just dose not care_about the line of people and one -PRON- get up to order -PRON- say there out of change
so -PRON- waist a whole morning wait on nothing in a place that shovel out fast_food this_place need new manager or owner run -PRON- because -PRON- fail at what -PRON- be
great service great quality fresh dough and ingredient
-PRON- family always love come_here to this great neighborhood pizzeria
everyone always seem to have a smile at this_place
all that wrap into what -PRON- consider to be the good quality for the price of any pizza_joint around keep -PRON- up guy
-PRON- would give a 5_star for the awesome staff and how_much -PRON- get for the price unfortunately the recent change of daycare hour take a huge hit on -PRON- appreciation for this gym
-PRON- child care be the main_reason -PRON- choose this gym but now that school be out the bad time possible to change daycare hour -PRON- have no daycare from 1pm-4pm
those be the main hour to go to the gym in the scorch summer for -PRON- mom with kid
look_like -PRON- may have to change gym now or else just get fat again have not decide which yet
eos please fix this problem
-PRON- would_rather -PRON- raise daycare price than to be unable to go to the gym
what a place
-PRON- a_bit expensive
so -PRON- can_not go there all the time but as a group_of 5 -PRON- enjoy this high_end old_school posh restaurant
-PRON- reservation be at 6:30 and -PRON- be seat almost immediately by a very courteous and attentive host and fuss over by a team of excellent professional wait staff
this be truly a great culinary adventure because -PRON- be celebrate -PRON- father birthday so this just add to a special night for all of -PRON-
the menu be very diversified and there be something for everyone
start with the complimentary appetizer bring to the table which include garlic_bread pickle and cottage cheese everything be fresh and the flavor be strong and outstanding
mmmm the garlic get to love -PRON- and -PRON- great for vampire repellent too
dual purpose appetizer always float -PRON- boat
move on to the salad -PRON- be good but when -PRON- go to a steak_house the salad be not the main event as the late john pinette once say salad be the promise that real food be come
and that -PRON- do
large juicy portion of prime_rib for the parent cook to perfection
-PRON- be a while since i have see such attractive plate with grill veggie on the side and a slab of cow that would make native albertans proud
do_not forget the baked_potato on the side slather in sour_cream
this make for some happy parent to have this meal bestow upon -PRON-
for the wife -PRON- have the steak neptune again cook to perfection and top with seafood and a lovely hollandaise sauce with beautiful seasonal veggie on the side
-PRON- son decide to be adventurous and try something new to -PRON- and pick the penne pasta top with tomato_sauce and grill_chicken
now i have to say when -PRON- be at a steak_house pasta do_not even register with -PRON-
however once -PRON- try this -PRON- will change -PRON- mind
-PRON- love -PRON- and -PRON- be cook to perfection
-PRON- have to try a sample of -PRON- just to see for -PRON- and this dish be a winner
the sauce be tangy and permeate with parmigiana cheese the pasta cook_perfectly and the sear on the chicken be perfect and yet so tender and juicy inside
i may have to take a crack at this -PRON- one day
for -PRON- i have the filet_mignon
once_again -PRON- outdo -PRON- with this thick tender steak wrap in bacon
the sear be perfect and the lovely pink medium be spot on to -PRON- taste
the veggie on the side especially the red_pepper just add to the experience which be top off with a baked_potato
if -PRON- think that_s -PRON- well there be also desert
now i -PRON- do_not take part in the desert menu -PRON- be more_than satisfied with the portion and the sample of other around -PRON-
so i have to opt out but -PRON- will say the various desert around the table be polish off with rave_review from -PRON- fellow diner
next_time i will have to save room for desert know that i may have miss out on something special
although -PRON- high_end and expensive -PRON- will want to treat -PRON- here for that special occaision when -PRON- want some over the top classy service and above_average food
5_star be not enough for this_place
thank -PRON- ana and happy 72'nd birthday dad
this review be for the original raman with the age gyoza combo for 12.99$. -PRON- be a huge noodles\/pasta fan
-PRON- raman be delicious but compare to bloor chain this_location 's broth seem less thick although more people prefer the thick broth -PRON- like the lighter more as -PRON- do_not tired u so_much with -PRON- pack of the flavour -PRON- pick the thick_noodle over the thin noodle add pork and nori on top= to perfection in -PRON- opinion anything_else u want to add in ur bowl -PRON- will be extra money
in -PRON- opinion the bowl of noodle be quite small -PRON- feel_like ajisen ramen have a big portion therefore -PRON- be not fill with the combo at all
and -PRON- be just a girl lol
nonetheless -PRON- be delicious
so -PRON- will not complain too_much about the size
the gyoza be very juicy and delicious serve over some orangey sauce with give -PRON- a lil kick
-PRON- really like -PRON- and this be a regular portion instead_of a small_portion for -PRON- side_dish with -PRON- raman combo
the decor of this_place be nice staff greet u loudly and clearly to welcome -PRON- guest and say good
bye loudly when u leave -PRON- restaurant
the bad thing_about this_place be the sitting -PRON- small table for 2 be uncomfortable and -PRON- chair be all hard so -PRON- bum bum hurt lol

well -PRON- look_at the receipt later and -PRON- never order the extra egg or cheese on -PRON- but -PRON- do get charge for chili cheese for the bfs burger so -PRON- be the right order for -PRON- for the most_part

still the chili cheese be -PRON- be mainly after
two very different burger and be the only order on the pas
really -PRON- be not hard to make -PRON- correct
-PRON- think -PRON- be a lack of attention to detail since the order be not make right
-PRON- be dry overcook and then the burger be not make even to what the ticket say

lightly season not char and greasy healthy eating
-PRON- love_this_place truly want to give -PRON- 5_star but -PRON- truly be a solid 4
-PRON- be the good italian food in the area by_far but by no means be this great italian food
the service be friendly the place be nice cozy
-PRON- have the fradiavolo the lasagna both of which -PRON- enjoy would have again
luckily -PRON- come on a wednesday evening which happen to be half price wine bottle night
this be probably -PRON- good feature every bottle on -PRON- menu be half off no_matter the list price
and -PRON- selection be easily one of if not the good selection of italian wine in the area
the night -PRON- be there -PRON- also have some live_music go
-PRON- be usually grumpy stay_away_from bar restaurant that have live_music since -PRON- be loud interrupt conversation with -PRON- fellow guest but this be nice and do well to add to the ambiance of the restaurant
overall -PRON- be happy to recommend_this_place look_forward_to return to this neighborhood gem
if all -PRON- want to read be this first sentence then here be all -PRON- really need to know try -PRON- weekend brunch and order the tofu scramble
tofu be one of those ingredient that half the world live in fear of
another small percentage of the population will brag about the tofu salad -PRON- have at lunch though -PRON- all know -PRON- have to choke -PRON- down
there be then people_who have experience tofu do right and thus genuinely love the stuff
trust that after try the tofu scramble at mickey 's -PRON- will fit into the latter group_of the tofu world
what make this tofu so wonderful be that -PRON- be marinate in peanut_butter
-PRON- be special
a common complaint with this often dismiss soy product be -PRON- tendency to taste bland if not prepare correctly
when -PRON- be cook up at mickey 's with just the right_amount_of rich peanut_butter this worry be null and void
add to this flavor pack mixture some sautéed spinach sweet red_pepper and red_onion
and -PRON- be no wonder this dish be know for win over anti tofu folk
the fresh produce cut the intensity of the peanut_butter tofu and offer great contrast in_term_of color and texture as_well
though -PRON- be only serve saturday and sunday the tofu scramble be so wonderful -PRON- will be crave -PRON- all week long
-PRON- love this neighborhood restaurant

-PRON- do_not eat -PRON- after the first_time -PRON- find that
the bar be not bad though
the drink be good the staff be friendly
although the bar and the restaurant be own by different people so -PRON- be a logistical nightmare to get a drink in the restaurant or food in the bar
and then to top -PRON- off -PRON- be in the bar the last_night of -PRON- stay
and -PRON- be verbally accost by one of -PRON- sale people_who make fun of -PRON- appearance -PRON- have -PRON- hair pull back and no make up on and then_proceed to boo the band from at the bar
this_place be good if the weather permit
if -PRON- be super hot or super cold do_not go
-PRON- all out door
-PRON- like the south one more because -PRON- be indoor
super fun place for drink
if this review be base_on cocktail alone -PRON- would be a high_rating
that_being_say the food be good but not amazing
-PRON- be a little_steep for the food -PRON- actually get
the ambience on the other_hand be lovely
very dark and intimate give -PRON- a very 20 's speak easy feel
the bartender strike the perfect_balance of be interactive but not nosy

-PRON- absolute_favorite place to eat pizza
the rest_of -PRON- menu be really good also
-PRON- love start_off with -PRON- ceasar salad
and -PRON- usually wash -PRON- all down with -PRON- peroni on_tap

-PRON- spend 4 hour here and rack up quite a bill
but -PRON- be a great evening with amazing food and amazing service
the seasonal menu offer lot_of interesting option
the homemade bread be wonderful and the cheese board be delicious
also delicious be the cold corn soup the eel which be one of -PRON- signature dish and the duck which be large enough on -PRON- be own as a meal
most other plate be good for sharing as -PRON- be small so -PRON- can try lot_of different thing

the service be truly amazing and the staff be so nice explain the food and give -PRON- recommendation and always make_sure -PRON- have water

-PRON- be a huge bww fan
but this be the only location where -PRON- receive great service every visit
the blazin wing and fry be -PRON- fav
the server be always generous to -PRON- wish the food wait be not so long
but -PRON- be worth the wait
-PRON- be excited when -PRON- find out that -PRON- be go to put a citi trends on -PRON- side of town
but if -PRON- do_not drive_past that place every_day to work then -PRON- never would have know that -PRON- be finally open
so -PRON- finally make -PRON- way in and stop through one day after work
and -PRON- be not impressed_with the selection of clothe like -PRON- be at the one locate on rancho
if -PRON- read -PRON- review for -PRON- rancho location -PRON- know that -PRON- be impressed_with the number_of actual name brand not knock off selection that -PRON- have
this one seem to have more no name brand for cheap like other discount store
the shoe selection here be huge though
shoe for day
and very well organized
not a complete mess like other store can be
-PRON- be a fan_of -PRON- houseware because -PRON- carry more afrocentric design and be very_reasonable_price
-PRON- would come_back to shop here
just more likely for -PRON- son or if -PRON- want a new item to decorate -PRON- house with
well -PRON- wait an_hour and 45_minute with some very_friendly people in line on a hot monday afternoon where -PRON- have very little else today
let -PRON- just say that the madeline 's be amazing

as for the cheesecake -PRON- be on -PRON- way home to try -PRON-
-PRON- be currently warm -PRON- lap on the streetcar
smell amazing
-PRON- think the food -PRON- be 3.5
-PRON- be a frequent customer and always get the small soup + noodle
the noodle thing be basically a small cup of noodle that -PRON- just dump into -PRON- soup
-PRON- tend_to find there be always too_much broth or maybe -PRON- be because -PRON- be a noodle eater
-PRON- know kinda like cereal where there be milk leave and no cereal
anyways -PRON- solve the problem with this menu_item
-PRON- also sell bubble_tea which -PRON- would rate as 3.5 to 4.0
-PRON- be not overtly sweet like most place
-PRON- service be good_than most pho place and the place look clean and nice
the bathroom could use some remodelling
-PRON- only accept cash and either credit\/debit
-PRON- can_not remember which one -PRON- do_not_accept
-PRON- give 5_star to king key locksmith kkl today because -PRON- be help at the time request joey be very_nice to do business with -PRON- cost be very_reasonable and -PRON- feel that if -PRON- do have any issue concern the product purchase joey or kkl would not hesitate in make_sure -PRON- be satisfied before leave
-PRON- do_not take critique business lightly
thanks joey
first thing first
-PRON- love the blue and white decor very greek
and the service be excellent
-PRON- order the spanakopita(and learn how to pronounce -PRON- a flaky pastry fill with spinach and feta cheese and the tiropita a flaky pastry fill with creamy cheese
-PRON- can say only that -PRON- be good but not great
have just experience the las_vegas greek food festival -PRON- could_not help compare and -PRON- like the spanakopita and tiropita -PRON- have there good
-PRON- also order the babaganoush
-PRON- also be good but not great
there be that slightly bitter aftertaste that -PRON- often detect in babaganoush
so while -PRON- would give this restaurant 5_star for -PRON- be charming decor and attentive server the food earn only 3_star from -PRON-
however the decor may lure -PRON- back to try -PRON- pasticcio(greek lasagna
and that will either make -PRON- or break -PRON-
this be the good pizza in_town
the price be reasonable and the staff if very_friendly and attentive
-PRON- highly_recommend the garlic_knot as_an_appetizer
-PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- always get the thin_crust and love love love this pizza

-PRON- husband be just as pleased_with -PRON- order of meatball squid ink pasta w crab and quail
the service be good
but -PRON- think the dish come_out a tad too quickly
e.g. -PRON- arrive at 9:15 and -PRON- be eat -PRON- last course by 10:15
overall though nora gray be one of -PRON- favourite montréal restaurant
fix -PRON- tire in under 20_minute and be super_nice
thankful that -PRON- be open on a sunday
bad service department ever
horrible communication
-PRON- take -PRON- all day to do am oil_change even when -PRON- have an_appointment

the minimum order be 10 which be not a bad deal
when -PRON- ask for dusted and -PRON- be not as bread as other place
the skin still have a nice crisp though but -PRON- have to ask for more sauce especially for the honey_garlic
the wing be not toss but drizzle on
-PRON- also get chipotle bbq as_well both sauce be tasty
-PRON- hostess\/waitress be really nice and serve -PRON- well
-PRON- will_definitely be return here when -PRON- have a wing craving

the attention to detail be incredible and just when -PRON- think -PRON- could_not get good -PRON- food choice change after -PRON- be there about_an_hour
-PRON- could tell -PRON- about individual item -PRON- eat
but -PRON- would be pointless because -PRON- be constantly change
what -PRON- can tell -PRON- be that -PRON- always fresh and every cuisine be represent
the asian choice be the good asian buffet food -PRON- have ever come_across
wicked_spoon be locate_in the cosmopolitan hotel and make_sure -PRON- follow the sign -PRON- be a walk

but at_least -PRON- be the nice cemetery in the city
mount pleasant be in that nice area of uptown where there be lot_of street level shop but -PRON- can still see that there be once grass beneath all the concrete
the area already have a lot_of gorgeous public park especially around lawrence but mount pleasant take the cake for gorgeous
-PRON- have a couple family_member bury here mostly in the indoor portion but -PRON- do love walk_through the area and explore
definitely creepy at nighttime and a much high possibility of get lose in the huge space but -PRON- be actually kind_of pretty during the day
if -PRON- live in_toronto and have never be to mount pleasant -PRON- be definitely something -PRON- should see because everyone know at_least one person bury here even if -PRON- be just the people_who own eatons
for tourist if -PRON- can get over the fact_that -PRON- be a cemetery -PRON- be definitely a nice peaceful day trip in a really nice part of town
fish be horrible -PRON- look old the color be dark
-PRON- have to stop eat because -PRON- be afraid -PRON- would get food poison
-PRON- know the fish be old by the time the uni come_out
-PRON- eat uni all the time
so when -PRON- arrive at -PRON- table and the color be off
-PRON- know -PRON- have to get up and leave
never again will -PRON- go to
this_place
if -PRON- could give this no star -PRON- would
but -PRON- can_not

if -PRON- be go to treat -PRON- to just one buffet during -PRON- trip to las_vegas this would not be -PRON- choice
-PRON- be fairly standard as_far as las_vegas buffet go
there be a large variety the quality be decent and the service be quite good
but overall -PRON- would say -PRON- be nothing overly special at_least when compare to other option in_las_vegas
for -PRON- one of the main_reason to try a buffet be to sample various desert that -PRON- may not find anywhere_else
the desert option here be a_bit lacking and uninspired
-PRON- suspect most of the desert be pre package
doctor be amazing -PRON- be kinda handsome so that be a plus
the staff be incredible
especially erica -PRON- be very_helpful in try to fit -PRON- in
-PRON- be extremely hard to get an_appointment especially with the hygienist because -PRON- be always so busy

super yummy
the potato purée and coddle egg be the good combination
-PRON- love egg and potato so this item be make for -PRON-
the mason jar -PRON- reuse -PRON- so do_not throw -PRON- away be cute
-PRON- be glad -PRON- finally get to try -PRON- before leave vegas suggestions for improvement -serve
water cup
-make more slut
so -PRON- do_not run out
the atmosphere be comfortable -PRON- be a place to bring the family
be not that what these chain be for anyway
-PRON- can be anywhere in the us and find a location the only difference would be the local staff
-PRON- be not entirely satisfied with the quality of food
the broccoli be dry bland and flavorless
the mash_potato taste_like instant potato that -PRON- buy at the bottom of the isle in -PRON- local grocery_store
the salmon have flavor and a pan sear crisp to -PRON-
though -PRON- do find a tiny bone not much else to say for that -PRON- would be good off with a burger
salmon be a mistake
the chip salsa and guac honesty be the good item order
-PRON- recommend if -PRON- be look for an_appetizer
what be with those table ipad
completely useless
-PRON- never describe the purpose -PRON- sit there take up a huge part of the table and -PRON- never use -PRON-
maybe if the entire menu be viewable
overall can_not say that -PRON- would_recommend this_place give the hundred of other drivable restaurant in the area
so -PRON- give this_place a merely two_star due_to -PRON- be sub_par cookie cutter quality
-PRON- be a tuesday morning at 10:30 am
-PRON- have previously call and ask for the hour and be tell 10 a.m.
unfortunately -PRON- arrive and there be no one here
multiple family be wait and repeat call no one answer or call back
be get ready to book a birthday party will reconsider
outstanding customer_service and the bike be not so bad either
the bmw warranty surpass what -PRON- have experience with harley davidson
-PRON- feel_like a such a fatty for write a review here
but the fat kid in -PRON- love cake
chocolate ganache premade cake that be
and what a deal for $_35 feed 4 6
but seriously -PRON- be more like 8
if -PRON- be to do -PRON- over again -PRON- would have pick chocolate_cake chocolate ganache interior and exterior versus the butter cream
now that be personal preference because -PRON- butter cream be incredible
as for the interior make for a nice gathering for tea
-PRON- be go to stop -PRON- review short because the more -PRON- rave_about this_place the low -PRON- self esteem seem to get
this be usually -PRON- favorite greek restaurant but the last_time -PRON- be there be so disappointing
-PRON- get there 5_minute before -PRON- open but -PRON- let -PRON- in and take -PRON- order
more people come in and start order
-PRON- all start get -PRON- food
and -PRON- be still sit there wait for -PRON- order
after wait for 25 minutes(20 minute after -PRON- be open -PRON- ask -PRON- how_much longer -PRON- be go to be
-PRON- say because -PRON- order before -PRON- open -PRON- do_not have the chicken prepare yet at the time -PRON- order so -PRON- be still wait for the chicken(that make no sense -PRON- start prepp at opening time and not before
-PRON- ask if -PRON- take more_than 20_minute to cook chicken
so -PRON- say -PRON- will check on -PRON-
-PRON- get -PRON- order almost 10_minute_later
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- should take 30_minute for a greek salad with chicken and rice bowl with chicken
specially when a party of about_10 people come in after -PRON- do be almost finish eat -PRON- food that -PRON- order after -PRON- do
-PRON- only give -PRON- 3_star because -PRON- like -PRON- food
otherwise -PRON- would have be 1_star
a friend and -PRON- go here on friday for lunch and be unfortunately disappointed
also unfortunate be the fact_that -PRON- both order the same exact thing
and that thing be the pesto chicken sandwich
the pesto seem fresh and taste pretty_good but the chicken be a little lacking in flavor and quite squishy
the sandwich just seem to be lack and be not memorable
-PRON- choose the potato_salad as -PRON- side and that be actually very good
for an_appetizer -PRON- have the baked artichoke ramekin and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend that to start
the space have get quite a face lift since mildred 's closed and -PRON- be lovely
the little bar in the back be a cozy little space to hide
love -PRON-
service be fine
-PRON- waitress be nice and -PRON- food do_not take too_long
overall -PRON- be not too pleased_with -PRON- visit but will have to check -PRON- out again
the lady sit_at a nearby table be gush about the spot burger which be something -PRON- will_likely try next_time
well -PRON- finally decide to do -PRON-
-PRON- own a 2014 harley davidson trike tri glide and just return from a 2_week trip to sturgis south dakota and back
-PRON- ride over 3,400 mile through dirt rain mud etc
-PRON- could only imagine the bug
today allen come over and spend hour clean -PRON- bike
-PRON- originally choose just the regular cheap detail but after see what -PRON- could do -PRON- upgrade to include the polish
after allen be do -PRON- inspect the bike
-PRON- look over every inch because -PRON- be a perfectionist when -PRON- come to a clean bike
and -PRON- be pay good money to have someone_else clean -PRON-
-PRON- be 100 satisfied
-PRON- be amazed at the attention to detail and the quality of work
-PRON- can see the pride allen put in to -PRON- work
thank -PRON- sir for do such a great_job all while deal with the 110 degree heat
-PRON- very much appreciate -PRON- and have already recommend -PRON- service to some friend
-PRON- friend and -PRON- stay_at the resort for the weekend and want to take a break
so -PRON- book manicure
-PRON- both love the lady that do -PRON- manicure
the view be beautiful and make -PRON- remember how pretty phoenix be
-PRON- be a little disappointed in the front_desk and lack of professionalism
-PRON- tell -PRON- to get there 15_minute early and when -PRON- do the front_desk people act annoy -PRON- be there early
also both lady be chomp on -PRON- gum and one lady come into the room -PRON- be get -PRON- nail do at to do -PRON- hair
overall -PRON- love the manicure but for a $ 45 manicure -PRON- would like the entire staff to be more professional
happen to be drive_by this catch -PRON- attention
-PRON- chili cheese dog craving be need to be fill
-PRON- each order -PRON- beef chili cheese dog which come with fry also an order of onion_ring
hot_dog be barely warm chili be very_flavorful but -PRON- just really do_not enjoy almost cold hot_dog
-PRON- use the leftover chili\/cheese to dip -PRON- fry in which be pretty_good
not plan on rush back here -PRON- just be not wow
this_company be absolutely the good
prompt professional and so efficient
-PRON- schedule -PRON- asap wrap up the service in record time and -PRON- do_not hurt that -PRON- price be a fraction of everyone_else 's
as a diyer -PRON- would even shop around for rental but -PRON- service be actually cheap
good of all -PRON- contact number go directly to the company 's owner anthony who almost instantly become -PRON- favorite customer care professional in the city so genuine and helpful -PRON- could_not be more grateful
-PRON- truly wish -PRON- company cover every household service -PRON- would not even consider go to anyone_else
-PRON- use to go to this barbershop quite frequently
-PRON- do want to support business in_phoenix who be either gay own and\/or gay friendly
this barbershop definitely do that and for this -PRON- commend -PRON-
however -PRON- have have two miserable haircut in a row
on_top_of that -PRON- have ask -PRON- about -PRON- promotion that -PRON- routinely send email about
-PRON- no_longer new the number that be assign to -PRON- when -PRON- register
-PRON- could_not help -PRON- with that
puzzle -PRON- leave
in any case -PRON- do_not think -PRON- will return
-PRON- have the misfortune of stay_at circus circus for one night a week_ago
luckily -PRON- discover the steakhouse thank to the review_on_yelp
the quality of the steak be amazing extremely tender and with an_excellent flavor
the place be a great value too because unlike other steakhouse the entree come with -PRON- choice of salad or soup a veggie and -PRON- choice of startch hubby have the rice blend and love -PRON-
and -PRON- have the baked_potato also excellent
the service be top_notch and the atmosphere retro remind -PRON- of some of the old_school steakhouse in san_francisco
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend this_place for those brave enough to walk_through circus circus to get there
-PRON- be worth though -PRON- -PRON- promise -PRON-
pizza be ok but the restaurant need some adult supervision
there be at_least four maybe six employee yesterday evening around 6:30pm
the 2 minute pizza take 20 because nobody be prepare the pizza
three employee be chat up a storm with a group_of teen that come in and do very little the entire time -PRON- be there
-PRON- to go order be wrong ingredient that -PRON- request and be read back to -PRON- by the person that take the order be not on the pizza
the caesar_salad be nothing but lettuce no cheese no crouton nothing but chop lettuce and a tub of dressing
overall average food and underwhelming service
if -PRON- want to try -PRON- better hurry because this restaurant will_likely close in the next 6_month
the service be great everyone be extremely professional and nice
-PRON- put a ton_of effort into -PRON- craft and do_not slack off at all the massage package be pretty worth -PRON- highly_recommend visit this spa
if -PRON- could give this_place negative_star -PRON- would the staff do_not_know_how to approach animal safely the owner be nasty fight with -PRON- for over_an_hour because -PRON- staff fail to call in a script and proceed to tell -PRON- how_much of an inconvenience -PRON- be -PRON- pay to have -PRON- dog see
the owner also proceed to make up story and argue_with -PRON- on facebook
professional
-PRON- think not
-PRON- tell -PRON- good_luck pay more for vaccination -PRON- would_rather pay more_than have -PRON- dog and -PRON- treat this way proceed with caution
-PRON- have to start_off by say that this be not the good buffet that -PRON- have ever try for that -PRON- would have to go to vegas
that say -PRON- doubt that -PRON- will find a good buffet in the phoenix_area
-PRON- eat outside with a nice view of the nearby mountain at sunset
the food quality be very good the variety be excellent and the service prompt
the desert bar be on_par with the good -PRON- have see anywhere
for what -PRON- get -PRON- find the pricing very_reasonable
overall a very good experience
-PRON- favorite chai latte in phx\/ scottsdale area
plus the $_1 off for yelp
customer be a great deal
honest to goodness review here
be come_here for some time now and have enjoy -PRON- for the most_part
today be a big ding in quality
maybe -PRON- be the time frame 1 am or maybe -PRON- just never notice
-PRON- order a 911 and -PRON- be just not at all what -PRON- would call good in any sense
6 shot of espresso with irish cream
for the first_time come -PRON- want something with a punch
for -PRON- that punch taste_like burnt
popcorn
-PRON- be not so awful that -PRON- could_not drink -PRON- but enough to warrant a review finally
-PRON- have always order -PRON- flavor pack drink
while good be considerably overloaded with sugar that could have hinder the taste of the actual coffee
-PRON- suppose -PRON- could adjust -PRON- to -PRON- taste
but now -PRON- be not_sure -PRON- even want to go_back anymore
-PRON- should have taste -PRON- and ask for another or something_different
but -PRON- do_not
-PRON- do_not_know if -PRON- be an isolated experience or that that coffee naturally taste_like burn popcorn and people just do_not_know because -PRON- order drink that mask -PRON-
-PRON- will_definitely be go_back of_course if only to make_sure -PRON- be just the one time
-PRON- drink something with enormous regret
-PRON- stomach be in 100 agreement as_well now
excellent customer_service and repair
-PRON- computer be freeze with a blue screen and -PRON- find the issue and -PRON- computer have be work great since -PRON- repair
will_definitely_return for -PRON- future computer repair
locate right at the top of mirvish village -PRON- often find -PRON- here for essential when -PRON- be too inconvenient to -PRON- kensington or fiesta farm
selection lot_of basic and like other_reviewer have note a good produce section for a small grocery
-PRON- even have prepackag fresh herb which -PRON- love
-PRON- also carry a huge_selection of drink plus lot_of kombucha price point be standard for the area and the girl behind the counter be friendly
the issue -PRON- have with this_place be -PRON- lacklustre refrigeration
the freezer be not cold enough and neither be the drink fridge which be frustrating hence lose 2_star
if -PRON- fix that problem -PRON- would be much fine place to shop
as -PRON- be -PRON- always find -PRON- pop over to the health food store next_door for frozen food and perishable dip
-PRON- bumper get ding -PRON- fault and allstate say -PRON- could take -PRON- car pretty_much anywhere to be repair be go to take -PRON- to the bmw dealer but after_read the review of rics online -PRON- decide to give the family business a try
really glad -PRON- do friendly professional complete before promise and good_than -PRON- could have ask for repair work
awesome business that -PRON- will recommend to everyone
way above and beyond
thank
be a huge pizzaville fan and recently_move from aurora to richmond hill -PRON- order in from this_location for the first_time this week
now -PRON- know restaurant have bad day but unfortunately this experience be -PRON- first at_this_location and as a result -PRON- will not be come_back
-PRON- have be a pizzaville customer for year with the same order every second friday from the fantastic aurora location
this experience though be awful in comparison
the pizza here be more like -PRON- typical cheap pizza place like little caesars
-PRON- experience with pizzaville have lead -PRON- to expect a good quality pizza than_most that be out there
usually -PRON- get a somewhat thin and crispy crust with even top spread and fantastic sauce
here be -PRON- experience start to place -PRON- order online as_usual and the website crash when do so -PRON- be unable to get back on the website so decide to call the location to order
-PRON- google the location and find -PRON- have -PRON- own website great which give -PRON- -PRON- phone_number
since -PRON- phone_number be plaster all over -PRON- site -PRON- give -PRON- a call to place -PRON- order
immediately the guy on the line get annoy with -PRON- for call that number maybe -PRON- should list the ordering phone_number on -PRON- website and tell -PRON- -PRON- should have call another number but will make an exception this one time
-PRON- be sorry be -PRON- give you business a favour -PRON- be do me somehow
go to pickup the food and the store be quite clean and the guy behind the counter not who -PRON- speak to on the phone be quite nice and pleasant
-PRON- hand -PRON- -PRON- pizza and -PRON- be on -PRON- way
when -PRON- get home and open the box -PRON- be shock at the carelessness with the way these be build
the pepperoni_pizza -PRON- get for -PRON- daughter have no spread of the topping and -PRON- actually have four slice with no pepperoni and the rest_of the slice pile with pepperoni
the other pizza for -PRON- wife and -PRON- have the wrong topping to start -PRON- despise olive and somehow end_up with olive
-PRON- ask for the pizza well do with extra sauce as_usual but the bottom of the pizza be barely brown and have barely_any sauce
also the topping issue from the previous pizza be the same with this one
-PRON- can go to little caesar to get a pizza slap together but at pizzaville -PRON- expect good
-PRON- will now be drive every other friday back to -PRON- trusty aurora locaiton where -PRON- seem to really_care_about the product -PRON- serve
-PRON- will now be leave a positive review for -PRON-
this_place be terrible
be super_excited to come_here for brunch and -PRON- be such a disappointment
the only_thing good be the mimosa
-PRON- wish -PRON- know the name of -PRON- waitress because -PRON- be super awesome
that be the only part of -PRON- meal that be fantastic with -PRON- service
-PRON- have a high pitch voice -PRON- would not be able_to miss -PRON-
order the thai chili prawn for an_appetizer
-PRON- be ok
-PRON- be not_sure if -PRON- be the manager put -PRON- on -PRON- table
but when -PRON- bring -PRON- out -PRON- have a mad look on -PRON- face like -PRON- hat -PRON- job
-PRON- have long hair a_little_bit colorful
personality not so colorful
not enough sauce
and -PRON- look_like -PRON- decorate -PRON- with cilantro
order an omelette and -PRON- be sick
have to cover -PRON- with a napkin
taste_like something -PRON- would order from denny_'s
consider this_place be triple the price
order the burger with the egg
-PRON- just be not good
sautéed spinach be good
eat that instead_of the burger
leave have a buzz from all the mimosa
wish -PRON- would have just go to mcdonald_'s for breakfast
atmosphere be super awesome except for the food
-PRON- be part of the yelp group as_well
parking be easy but find the front_door be a little difficult for -PRON-
-PRON- know next_time to use maps
-PRON- have take one cycling class before and this one be way different
the shoe be great to have for the bike
-PRON- take -PRON- a while to get use to the bike move leave and right
-PRON- think -PRON- be go to fall
but once -PRON- get use to -PRON- -PRON- be good
after -PRON- leg and butt be get super tired -PRON- be happy to move into strength training
2 day_later -PRON- muscle be still sore and -PRON- love -PRON-
definitely_recommend for intermediate cyclist
and just warn the beginner that the bike take get use to
airport food suck
-PRON- be nearly impossible to find a decent meal that have not be sit there for day but this pei wei be pretty_decent
the staff be nice as friendly the fridge be stock with many variety_of water beer juice and sandwich
the sandwich and sushi look just ok though so -PRON- opt_for chicken lettuce_wrap
-PRON- pay_$ 15 for those and a fancy look bottle_of water and -PRON- be tasty
the lettuce be crispy and fresh the chicken just a_bit overseasoned the chestnuts crunchy
-PRON- would have prefer peanut_sauce to the spicy one -PRON- serve but overall that be a satisfy meal
how can -PRON- not love a lil old italian man scoop out gelato and regale -PRON- with tale from the old country
-PRON- could_not understand a god damn thing -PRON- say but man -PRON- be nice
and -PRON- give -PRON- salt_caramel gelato fuck yes
the place be small but awesome -PRON- 's family own\/run\/orient
pretty_sure -PRON- have a baseball bat behind the counter to club any nay say'er
-PRON- have be warn
this be one of -PRON- go to sushi place -PRON- be a little small but the food be delicious and the service be great
-PRON- food quality however do fluctuate and while -PRON- be still good -PRON- be good before
-PRON- could be due_to a change of owner but so_far -PRON- be pretty_good
so -PRON- will_continue go here
also parking in this tiny plaza can be very tight be prepared to have to squeeze pass car if -PRON- be busy
have lunch at southern rail
love the place
as any foodie in_phoenix know justin beckett have blaze new trail here in_phoenix for some time
the location on west camelback have an urban feeling that be not find in_phoenix
the space be in an_old building that have be refurbish wonderfuly
but the food be the main attraction -PRON- have the gumbo for a starter and -PRON- be one of the good -PRON- have ever have
for -PRON- main dish -PRON- have the chicken and biscuts wow
amazing
a hostel be a hostel
either_way -PRON- cut -PRON- -PRON- be probably a good idea to be a wee bit drunk before -PRON- go to bed so as to ensure a sound night sleep
general disclaimer aside the global village be not_too_bad
25 dollar for a dorm room bed which be the standard big room with bunk bed
the bathroom on -PRON- floor be clean and do_not make -PRON- wonder_if -PRON- would contract something
but
-PRON- stay_here one night in january and -PRON- be freeze cold
woke up at 4 a.m. and promptly ball -PRON- up under the cover and stop move to retain body heat
that say -PRON- can get extra blanket the staff be super_nice
there be also a free breakfast which be pancake coffee and cereal
really the good part of this_place be the location
king and spadina be a great spot from which to launch any toronto adventure
probably would not stay_here over a night or two
wowza
such an amazingly great surprise to find this_place
-PRON- be walk_around the sunday farmers market on the canal and try this_place when -PRON- get hungry
there be this great happy_hour all day sunday -PRON- have to try
-PRON- enjoy the taco fingerling potato pork wing with spicy slaw procuitto brusetta
everything be so tasty
-PRON- have be come to this_location since -PRON- open and have always have an enjoyable experience
the staff have be nice and the service have be great
the only_downside with this_place be that the appointment system be not very great
even when -PRON- book an_appointment -PRON- still do_not get in until about_15 20_min after
-PRON- be currently write this review while -PRON- be wait for an_appointment that should have start 21 min ago other_than_that the experience have be enjoyable so -PRON- would_recommend this_place to other
order fettuccine alfredo and the sauce be completely separate
-PRON- look_like butter and curdle cheese
-PRON- would not recommend_this_place
-PRON- be in_town for superbowl sunday and be take to black bear

-PRON- favorite go to buffet spot in_las_vegas
even_though the bachabal buffet in_vegas be rat high and number 1 -PRON- still prefer this one
do_not get -PRON- wrong the bachanal buffet in_vegas be great but the extra food selection be just adequate to -PRON-
-PRON- rather pay_$ 30 less and wait 2 hrs less
-PRON- wish -PRON- have a big appetite because -PRON- can_not eat that much
-PRON- have a unique diverse selection of food from pho vietnamese noodle_soup to gelato green_tea ice_cream
here be -PRON- favorite food selection prime_rib cold crab_leg cold cocktail shrimp chicken_wing gelato ice_cream saute clam and the mongolian or teppanyaki not_sure which name be proper to use grill
-PRON- would not mind the m buffet because -PRON- have an small open bar
recently the rio casino combine -PRON- regular buffet and seafood buffet into one location use to be seperate
-PRON- can upgrade to the seafood buffet for $_15 more
personally -PRON- have the seafood buffet a few_month_ago for the first_time before both location be merge and be quite disappointed
-PRON- do_not even have lobster_tail or prime_rib
have both buffet build together make more sense to -PRON-
hired parker services to do some work around -PRON- house
-PRON- and -PRON- crew -PRON- outstanding and stand up guy
-PRON- address every issue and concern -PRON- have
-PRON- go_above and beyond for the job

-PRON- start go to this dunkin around nov 2014
at that time service be good coffee be make correctly and there be usually always a good selection of donut available
-PRON- want to say -PRON- be sometime around march 2015 when everything change
-PRON- order an ice_coffee with cream and sugar easy enough right
-PRON- guess not
-PRON- seem that ask for cream and sugar mean -PRON- would like a tablespoon worth of coffee and the rest to be sugary milk
the last_time -PRON- go -PRON- finally just hand the coffee back and say -PRON- order a coffee
i'm not pay for milk
the kid that -PRON- be speak to be nice enough but
when the lady behind -PRON- ask what be wrong -PRON- be the one who have make -PRON- in the first place
-PRON- snatch -PRON- from -PRON- as if -PRON- would do something wrong and tell -PRON- to get out of -PRON- damn way
-PRON- really wish -PRON- have catch -PRON- name
so -PRON- could have complain_about -PRON- directly
in_addition to this -PRON- almost never get -PRON- order right
ask for a plain bagel with butter and -PRON- will get a poppy bagel with cream_cheese and food that should be warm be cold or not cook at all
-PRON- be ridiculous
aside_from that the employee at_this_location be well how do -PRON- put this nicely
nasty
-PRON- mean if -PRON- be not go to put the least bit of effort into -PRON- appearance and wash your damn uniform shirt why be -PRON- go to think -PRON- wash -PRON- hand before -PRON- touch -PRON- food and drink
this_location have get to be the bad dunkin -PRON- have ever be to
-PRON- husband
and -PRON- agree -PRON- will_never go here again even if -PRON- mean drive out of -PRON- way to go elsewhere
honestly -PRON- wish -PRON- could give a negative_star rating

-PRON- just love_this_place so_much
-PRON- feel -PRON- be do an injustice by not write about -PRON-
the patio be shade with mister
the food be really great quick lunch fare -PRON- also serve breakfast
but -PRON- have not try -PRON- yet
what steal the show in the summer along_with the patio be the lemonade that -PRON- traditionally like to mix with the blackberry jasmine tea
-PRON- be officially addict
take a large glass out to the over sized seating on the patio under the mister on a beautiful summer day be the good because -PRON- patio be shade by the building
-PRON- be not a large patio
but -PRON- really be such a peaceful spot
the food be very yummy and the big pro be most of -PRON- be exceptionally healthy
-PRON- use fresh_ingredient and have unique salad
the jalapeno avocado hummus be a must_try
of_course -PRON- can_not help but mention what a wonderful staff -PRON- have
-PRON- be find on the hot day when most people just want to go home and chill in the comfort of -PRON- ac the staff at the herb box
be friendly kind and welcome
-PRON- appreciate this as -PRON- know -PRON- be hard for business to make -PRON- through the rough summer month here in az
thank guy for do what -PRON- do
this_location be not_too_bad
the bread be soft and everything make -PRON- happy
but the staff in here -PRON- be too mean
the make fun and -PRON- do_not make the right bread -PRON- want
-PRON- do_not take the hot bread for -PRON-
-PRON- laugh at -PRON- when -PRON- get trouble
the last thing -PRON- would_recommend to everyone should not come_here
they are too rude
-PRON- really do_not like the service in here
lobby be tight
as only the 3rd person in line -PRON- still feel_like -PRON- be stand half in the doorway
both staff_member behind the desk be quite comfortable give out room number out loud as -PRON- check -PRON- in great security there but could_not be bother to welcome anyone to the hotel direct anyone to the elevator inform anyone abut any of the amenity on_site or do much more_than hand -PRON- -PRON- key and watch as -PRON- blindly set off in search of -PRON- room
the wallpaper be peel off the wall in -PRON- room in more_than one spot
the tv be in an armoire on the wall next to the bed so -PRON- can_not really watch when -PRON- be lay in bed
-PRON- be on a little pull out shelf that be probably suppose to help but do_not since -PRON- only pull out about an inch
the sleep number bed be cool to test out at_least the one side that work
although like another_reviewer say -PRON- would probably need more_than one night to figure_out -PRON- setting
be not about to try the room service here but -PRON- do check_out the pool\/spa area on -PRON- way back from a nearby restaurant
-PRON- be disgusting
the pool water do_not appear to be circulate at all
and -PRON- could_not tell whether the brown spot be in the water or just the bottom of the pool needing repaint
same idea with the hot_tub
would not have get in either one of those if -PRON- pay -PRON-
do_not notice until the morning that there be no shampoo in -PRON- room
not that -PRON- really want to shower in there anyway at this point
decide although -PRON- do_not_know_why to try the breakfast buffet in the morning
the fact_that the outdated and draw on directory in the room list the breakfast buffet at $_14 or $_16 something and -PRON- have since lower the price to $_7 should have tell -PRON- that most people be smart enough not to eat there
-PRON- be a seat -PRON- buffet in the lobby and -PRON- take -PRON- a few_minute to realize the gentleman in the red sweatshirt and jean play with the silverware on a nearby table actually work there
-PRON- ask -PRON- to bring_out some more scramble_egg since the one on the buffet be dry out and stick to the pan
only then do -PRON- even acknowledge -PRON- presence and send -PRON- back to the front_desk to pay for -PRON- breakfast
-PRON- have some toast scramble_egg dry out sausage and a little sausage_gravy minus the rock hard mini biscuit that someone laughably think -PRON- hotel guest may attempt to consume
all under the watchful if not stalkerish eye of the lone dining_room attendant
ok the last bit may be a_bit harsh
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be just try to stay close in case -PRON- demand anything_else crazy like fresh egg but
really don't -PRON- have anything -PRON- can be do while -PRON- be wait
this be -PRON- first radisson stay and if this be the standard -PRON- may just be the last
-PRON- think -PRON- have a good reputation than that
fresh and fast
great service and quality food
-PRON- be particularly fond of nights in white satin and space oddity but everything -PRON- have have have be nothing short of excellent
avoid this
place
this be the close place to -PRON- hotel to get a slice of pizza so -PRON- decide to try -PRON- out
what a huge mistake -PRON- be -PRON- first night in_vegas and this_place give -PRON- diarrhea
-PRON- spend the whole night use the bathroom while -PRON- be out
-PRON- spend the next two day recover as_well do_not get to have as much_fun since -PRON- be always worry_about go to the bathroom
mike -PRON- do such a wonderful job with jake groom today
-PRON- look and smell great thank -PRON- so_much
-PRON- be very_impressed_with centre pointe nails spa
-PRON- buy the groupon and be not expect a+ treatment from such an inexpensive no name place
at cheap place -PRON- have come to expect speedy bare minimum service and honestly all -PRON- really_care_about be how -PRON- nail look in the end but -PRON- be nice to actually feel pampered
-PRON- be there 90 minute for the pedicure and manicure
there be a nice selection of opi and china glaze polish
the place seem really new and clean and the regular pedicure include a hot stone massage
the woman_who do -PRON- nail take -PRON- time with each step in the process
-PRON- even massage -PRON- shoulder briefly while -PRON- sit with -PRON- nail under the uv light
totally unexpected but much appreciate
-PRON- come_back to make_sure the first_time be not a fluke
-PRON- receive the same amazing service and food with george make -PRON- that way again
but kenny the manager remember -PRON- daughter pour salt think -PRON- be parmesan and -PRON- bring_out a cup of -PRON- for -PRON-
above and beyond
may 22
george be -PRON- server and -PRON- be polite and prompt and when -PRON- 4 year_old daughter think the salt be parmesan and cover -PRON- kid pasta with -PRON-
george with any reservation say -PRON- would take_care_of -PRON- and get -PRON- a new one at no charge even know -PRON- be out fault
-PRON- family have be go to the island for a long_time and always enjoy the meal but since then update there food -PRON- be now amazing
-PRON- have a new soft bun and the cheese fry now have a cheddar jack cheese which be incredible
-PRON- wife have some chicken taco and -PRON- eat everyone and do_not need to bring any home
so a huge shout_out to george who have -PRON- lpn and work on -PRON- rn
the food be okay but the service be super slow
-PRON- meal come_out in bit and piece
-PRON- have 4_people with -PRON-
one half of -PRON- receive -PRON- order first then the other half receive part of -PRON- order 20_minute_later
another part of the order come shortly_after that
weird
-PRON- be always suspicious of pho hoa because -PRON- be a chain and the one in palo alto and sj in the bay be terrible
that be say -PRON- do_not think pho hoa tell -PRON- franchise operator how to make the food because the one in philly and the one in_charlotte be pretty damn good
-PRON- have have both the banh xeo -PRON- give -PRON- 2 for some_reason and the pho dac
biet
and -PRON- be both solid
-PRON- have be tell by trustworthy source that this be the good pho in_town and as someone_who rarely order pho anymore
-PRON- be pretty pleased
one of -PRON- regular haunt and -PRON- find the ever change menu refreshing and interesting
-PRON- be a clean well run cafe\/coffee shop locate_in the ballantyne village at the intersection of hwy 521 and ballantyne commons
-PRON- most_recent lunch experience introduce -PRON- to the good onion_ring -PRON- have have
-PRON- be hand make thickly slice and lightly bread
-PRON- fry up so nicely crisp not greasy and be serve as_an_appetizer or side to a meal
the big comment be that -PRON- be not the thick batter grease absorb variety serve so proudly as beer batter
terrace cafe onion_ring be supreme
all the plate be nicely present portion be adequate service prompt and -PRON- can make substitution on the menu
another yelp find -PRON- venture into fabarnak for a light lunch before head out of town
-PRON- share four small_plate devil duck egg cheese toast marrow and chicken_wing along_with the cucumber_salad
what interesting texture and flavor
the waiter explain_how the chef like to incorporate unlikely ingredient into common dish
all -PRON- can say be -PRON- work
even -PRON- 13yo and 10yo
who admittedly have different palate than_most enjoy the experience
the 10yo would_recommend the cheese toast the 13yo eat more marrow than -PRON- would have expect and -PRON- be a big_fan_of the salad with goat feta yum
sleek atmosphere friendly_staff tasty dish and all for a good because definitely_worth -PRON- time
great box
-PRON- husband and -PRON- be in_town for some business and decide to do a couple of drop in
chaz be the instructor and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- take time in make -PRON- feel as if -PRON- be at -PRON- own box back home
everyone there be very_welcoming as_well
-PRON- will_definitely_come_back if -PRON- be in_town
thank
this_place be by_far the good -PRON- have find
-PRON- trust -PRON- eyelash to no one else
-PRON- have be come_here for a year
great staff
always try to accommodate to -PRON- need will squeeze -PRON- in where ever -PRON- can
ana -PRON- be amazing
some may find -PRON- a little pricy but truly -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
not one single complaint for these_guy
-PRON- stop in twice last_weekend for brunch the first_time because -PRON- be excited to check -PRON- out and the second_time because -PRON- friend pick the spot as a surprise
the atmosphere be nice and -PRON- especially enjoy the live_music on sunday much_more lively than saturday
the service be decent but definitely some kink still need to be work out
the food be solid but nothing -PRON- would crave so_much to keep come_back to
-PRON- enjoy the baby kale brie and green apple omelette with bacon and wheat toast with a mango lemonade on -PRON- first_visit and two over easy egg with bacon and wheat toast on -PRON- second_visit
for sunday_brunch -PRON- take_advantage_of the $_20 bottle_of champagne and a carafe of orange_juice but honestly be not that impress the twist top bottle_of sparkle wine be a_bit of a letdown
overall a nice place and probably only worthy of 3 1\/2_star but -PRON- give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt for be so newly open
-PRON- have always be a fan_of cowboy caio for dinner but think -PRON- would try brunch when -PRON- have a friend in_town from_hawaii who want an_old town scottsdale experience
great food
-PRON- have egg and hash
the service be unattentive ask for pepper not on the table have to ask twice for iced_tea refill and there be only 6 table
overall -PRON- will be back for dinner but probably not for lunch\/brunch
$ 60.00 for two no alcohol be a little_steep for no value add 's i.e. a homemade mini muffin basket upon_arrival etc and unattentive service
great food friendly atmosphere and awesome dessert
-PRON- can_not say anything negative about this office
from dr. santucci to -PRON- staff -PRON- be always welcome with a smile and dr. santucci just create beautiful result
-PRON- be so patient wait for -PRON- son 's tooth to come in before -PRON- start full brace and -PRON- office always give -PRON- convenient after school hour unless there be something major to be tweak which -PRON- understand
-PRON- be an orthodontic nightmare -PRON- actually feature in two usc textbook back in the day)
so -PRON- do alot of research and visit many orthodontic office before happily decide on dr. santucci
unscheinbar von außen aber echt eine der besten pizzerias in ludwigsburg
beim eintreten riecht man die frische pizza aus dem holzofen
a propos pizza so soll sie sein luftig knusprig heiß
ein echt vergnügen
einen stern abzug gibt
es dafür dass man
an einem freitag um 18:00 keinen rucola besorgen kann und_die bedienung erst eine halbe
stunde nach der bestellung ankam um zu sagen dass es keinen rucola gibt
ansonsten ein klasse laden
in the word of the poet drake -PRON- be the good -PRON- ever have
-PRON- have have fresh lobster before great
-PRON- have have fresh lobster in an okay roll before meh
-PRON- have now have fresh lobster in a delicious well_prepared and season roll hot damn
-PRON- be not kid when -PRON- say -PRON- would name -PRON- first bear luke whom would look strange with -PRON- dark skin tone if -PRON- mean -PRON- could have luke 's lobster for even a month for free
-PRON- child_'s lifetime name be worth -PRON-
let that say something
before -PRON- hunt through the entire fashion show mall to meticulously try to locate this_place -PRON- be outdoors
on the strip face side of the mall
-PRON- be intimidate by the price of a $_17 lobster roll but that quickly go away
these be not a stingy bunch
-PRON- literally stack -PRON- roll full of lobster
like how philly cheesesteaks be make in philly
the flavor of -PRON- roll -PRON-
-PRON- be confident will haunt -PRON- dream
-PRON- be so delicious
please please please go
-PRON- need a reason to say -PRON- be welcome to -PRON-
great store that be full of love for animal and high_quality supply at a wide range of price
one of -PRON- dog 's have special medical need and -PRON- be able_to special order -PRON- supply that -PRON- do_not have in stock
-PRON- be always greet with a smile and treat for the dog
this be the true image of a local_business
buy living room furniture last_year and bruce be most helpful and good of all not pushy
offer -PRON- financing at 0 interest for 1 year
the price be so good -PRON- take -PRON- sister in law there last_week
and -PRON- buy a houseful of furniture because the price be so_much good_than what -PRON- have be look_at in the other major furniture store
-PRON- find the same sofa loveseat and chair for $_200 less
go to this_place because of -PRON- dad
-PRON- want something to eat\/drink -PRON- be not hungry but think a place with the word italian in -PRON- locate_in dilworth on east blvd would have some decent coffee
-PRON- do_not realize -PRON- be a chain
-PRON- sit_down at a table outside on the patio
waiter come up and -PRON- be about to ask -PRON- about espresso drink when -PRON- cut -PRON- off and say something along the line -PRON- just have regular american coffee nothing_fancy
first of all espresso be not fancy
second of all when -PRON- call -PRON- anything italian and -PRON- do_not have espresso -PRON- be a fraud
so needless_to_say after this ignorant waiter manage to piss -PRON- off by imply -PRON- be pretentious for want fancy coffee
-PRON- do_not get anything -PRON- dad get one drink and -PRON- leave
also some other table near -PRON- be just get -PRON- pizza as -PRON- be leave and -PRON- look_like awful medium thick crust flavorless frozen pizza
from the review on here that sound about right
seriously just call the place bad american pizza
the only_reason -PRON- be give this_place even 1_star be because -PRON- finally go out of business
nandos have the good mexican_food ever
huge portion and great service
the price be reasonable too
have only 5 piece_of shrimp in shrimp fry_rice
-PRON- be very rude and very mean
the buddha delight have very little tofu in
the portion be too small for the money
when -PRON- call to tell the woman about this -PRON- start yell_at -PRON-
-PRON- would be nice if -PRON- know -PRON- name
but -PRON- would not give -PRON- name
wow
wir waren gestern mit daily deal gutscheinen für_ein
burger menü hi und be soll ich sagen das war echt der hammer
allerding meine ich nicht das
burger menü welch aber auch sehr leck war denn wir bekaman zum probieren vorneweg spareribs
die haben un echt umgehauen so super haben die geschmeckt selbst in amerika habe ich noch keine besseren gegessen und be man sonst in stuttgart an ribs bekommt kann man eh vergessen
die inhaber und mitarbeiter sind absolut nett und freundlich also ein richtige wohlfühllokal
wir haben dann noch den
cheesecake new_york style zum mitnehman bestellt da wir
zu satt waren um diesen dort zu essen
wir wurden nicht enttäuscht auch der kuchen ist der hammer gewesen wie in new_york nur wesentlich günstiger
denn dort kostet der kuchen bis zu $ 9,00
die preise sind für die qualität absolut günstig
wir komman wieder denn wir sind fan der amerikanischen küche und dies lokal könnte auch diejenigen überzeugen
welche behaupten die amis würden nur fast_food essen
goodhandy 's be a sexy dark bar with a really diverse crowd
-PRON- go often during -PRON- last queer idol singing competition and have a great time
trans positive a+++ queer positive ally positive good place to dance just not accessible at all lot and lot_of stair
otherwise great
will go again
this be a nice studio with good instructor
the change room be a little measly with only a curtain across the door and no proper security to leave belonging
the main studio be big and beautiful maybe a little too big though
not very warm or cozy feeling and
sometimes -PRON- be really far_away from the instructor
not great parking in the area either
all in all this be still a good place to practice yoga
-PRON- be out in the area for some shopping and notice this wine bar 's patio
-PRON- be a wonderful unplanned stop
the food be great hummus cheese plate and pizza be all super delicious
the hummus may be the good -PRON- have have
the service be great as_well
the wine_list be nice with reasonably_price red and white about 8 10 of each with lot_of variety
when -PRON- each decide -PRON- want something_different for -PRON- second glass the waitress suggest something similar to -PRON- first glass that -PRON- may like -PRON- especially appreciate that
definitely_worth check_out if -PRON- be in the solon area especially on a nice spring or summer day
all the fizzle and sizzle seem to have die down a_bit
-PRON- can_not say -PRON- frequent this_place as -PRON- be be nearly impossible to get a seat most of the time
but -PRON- have have -PRON- chance and have be lucky to visit about handful of time in the past 2 year
-PRON- must admit -PRON- do buy into all that hype a few_year back and be impressed at first but as -PRON- taco taste_bud have develop great experience -PRON- be start to become a little too snobby for this_place -PRON- suppose
the taco be dry and -PRON- be hop -PRON- be just a bad batch as of late
-PRON- do_not recall -PRON- be this dry when -PRON- first_visit a few_year back
pork_belly dry beef dry fish
okay that be not dry
but the taco shell be dry dry dry
-PRON- know taco shell be suppose to be dry
but -PRON- doubt -PRON- should be dry to the point where -PRON- stick to the side of -PRON- mouth if -PRON- do_not chew -PRON-
probably cause by the generous flour dusting on the shell as -PRON- touch -PRON- mouth form a dough consistency thereby stick to -PRON- mouth
the flavour be strong but somehow lack complexity
there seem to be a flavour imbalance of some_sort
this be more of a fusion take on mexican flavour as there be obvious asian\/local flare
all in all -PRON- be quite disappointed to say the least
the last 2_3 visit have be more and more disappointing
staff at this store by_far be friendly and helpful
-PRON- get -PRON- ipad pro at this store and the manager make -PRON- trip a pleasurable and this be not the last -PRON- will be in this store thank
-PRON- nice and helpful folk

the hole be always smooth
-PRON- do a great_job

however -PRON- be willing_to pay_$ 4 for the bag of jimmy buffet margaritaville corn chip that -PRON- can_not get anywhere_else
5_star for the experience 4 start for the overprice item
-PRON- friend from ohio have -PRON- hooked on postino 's
-PRON- have try this_location as_well_as -PRON- location in arcadia
-PRON- have truly love both time that -PRON- have go
-PRON- would prefer the central location only because -PRON- be easy to park
and -PRON- like the atmosphere\/vibe
be careful not to park in area that be restrict
the only_downside to this_location be that -PRON- be adjacent to a circle k. this be -PRON- view
but -PRON- could have also sit the other direction and look_at the bar
-PRON- honestly have not try any of -PRON- main food item
-PRON- boyfriend have get -PRON- chicken mozzarella panini and -PRON- be really good
-PRON- always get -PRON- charcuterie board

-PRON- be desperate to find a good chicken fry_steak
-PRON- find -PRON- here
-PRON- will be honest
the 5_star be really just for the chicken fry_steak
-PRON- do_not_care that much for -PRON- other steak
the service be prompt so -PRON- do_not_mind too_much that -PRON- do_not smile
just bring -PRON- -PRON- chicken fry_steak and mash_potato and gravy and leave -PRON- alone
oh_yeah if -PRON- go at lunchtime the chicken fry_steak special be only $_7
-PRON- step -PRON- up and add a lot more design
the staff be friendly and helpful
the quality of the shirt be good as_well
there be no sign except the tiki logo on the building
-PRON- be big_fan_of swiss chalet but this be -PRON- first_visit to this_location
-PRON- choose -PRON- because -PRON- be in the area often and have never be
to say the visit do_not start out well would be an understatement
when -PRON- enter there be no one at the hostess stand nor any staff visible anywhere
-PRON- wait about_10_minute and still nobody
-PRON- wound up have to walk down to the takeout area also abandon where -PRON- find a bell to ring for service
do the fact -PRON- be there mean that this be a common issue
-PRON- ring -PRON- and a very bored look woman come_out
-PRON- ask if -PRON- should just sit anywhere and -PRON- yell out for another staff_member who do finally seat -PRON-
-PRON- be order 1\/4 chicken dinner and -PRON- be go to order dark meat but the server say that -PRON- would_recommend the white because the 1\/4s be very small so -PRON- would do the white meat without charge for the up size
the food be good although even the white meat be small than -PRON- be use to and the service be adequate
-PRON- decide to get sundae for dessert and find out that -PRON- be out of whip_cream this_location be directly beside a grocery_store
no one could get whip_cream
but the server say -PRON- would put extra ice_cream in lieu
the server do -PRON- good to remedy the situation but the visit leave -PRON- feeling that this_location really do_not seem to care_about the customer experience and would_rather understaff and\/or under order than have satisfied customer
not good for long hair
probably fine for a boy cut with clipper
-PRON- realize that this be not a fancy salon the lady be very_nice and make -PRON- girl feel_comfortable but the cut be choppy uneven and look_like -PRON- do -PRON-
the lady that cut -PRON- old_daughter hair barely get -PRON- wet and then take dull scissor to -PRON- straight across
the end be fray uneven and horrible
the manager be nice enough to fix -PRON- but -PRON- be still bad
thank_goodness

the picture blow be after the fix
-PRON- realize the cut be 16.50 but -PRON- question if -PRON- have current license

-PRON- have good memory of boa lv
-PRON- service and food be exceptional
-PRON- suppose the economy for a first class steakhouse be too_much because of all the competition from reality star like collichio and ramsay
those restaurant be good
but boa be just as good but do_not have a star to promote -PRON-
thank -PRON- boa for a high class atmosphere and first class service

oh and -PRON- love the touch pool who get to pet a stingray
this girl
for a restaurant situate in the heart of the financial district -PRON- certainly do_not deliver in any of the area -PRON- may expect
well that be not true the price be right in line with what -PRON- would expect to pay at a fine steakhouse
the product though that be another story
-PRON- stop_by for dinner saturday_night after an active day in the city
the patio look decent and -PRON- be in need of some hearty grub
-PRON- walk inside and out the gate
-PRON- be obvious that something be up the place be completely empty on a saturday_night
at that point -PRON- mull a quick exit but feel compel to stay so that -PRON- could cross this_place off the list
rather_than turn this into a novel -PRON- will highlight what come next
-PRON- start with straight absolut on the rock an_old standby
on first sip the drink have a perfume taste
straight vodka with a taste of cough syrup that can_not be right
-PRON- send the drink back
the second round be the same deal
after talk to the manager -PRON- be discover that the spout pour the drink be dirty which transfer the taste over
that be comforting
the $_40 fillet minion come_out completely sub_par tough and dry white in the middle
-PRON- would get a good steak at a dive_bar
to top -PRON- off the gorgonzola on_top be cheap and a whole different kind_of funky than -PRON- typical gorgonzola
the rib be accompany with a delicious rotten coleslaw -PRON- could actually smell this no need to taste but of_course by accident -PRON- do
yum
-PRON- mash_potato side be watery and bland
that be -PRON- for -PRON-
but the fun do_not stop there on -PRON- way out
a roach be spot run up the wall of the ladies washroom
and not -PRON- typical every restaurant have get -PRON- baby roach
this roach have some meat on -PRON- rib totally repulsive
the staff have a defeatist aura about -PRON-
everyone know the place be in trouble but -PRON- be go about -PRON- business without acknowledge -PRON-
maybe -PRON- believe that if ignore -PRON- enough the problem will solve -PRON-
fat chance but that be the only rationalization -PRON- can put forth on that one
if this_place have a reputation to maintain -PRON- good start invest in -PRON- or just close the place that be probably a good move
finally if -PRON- be not at_least for the manager 's attempt to try and apologize for the series of misstep -PRON- encounter this_place would get a zero but -PRON- be get a one as there be a small glimmer of hope
that with the right attention and investment from whatev body own this_place -PRON- may have a chance to turn_around
or -PRON- can continue to ruin the brand that be fine too no one be come already
so -PRON- be not like -PRON- can do any bad
so wind out the end of year in pittsburgh and decide after fly in a_little_bit early to give tako a try
-PRON- have hear quite a_bit of mixed review to date and -PRON- have be on -PRON- bucket list for try out so_glad -PRON- be finally able_to do so
since -PRON- be in relatively early on a sunday there be no wait
and there be plenty_of seat to be find at the bar
-PRON- pull_up a chair as close to the right end of the bar as_possible
so -PRON- could get a glimpse of the chef prepare the food
the décor be the whole dark\/mysterious\/casual vibe with the dj like music playing in the background
-PRON- provide -PRON- menu in newspaper format with a list of separate special if -PRON- desire to peruse
-PRON- will_admit the price be a_bit steep here for the portion but where_else can -PRON- get something like this in pittsburgh
the menu be break_down into multiple small_plate and then multiple variety_of taco
-PRON- also have a relatively large_selection of adult beverage and the bartender be pretty knowledgeable even with the standard curve ball of surprise -PRON- with an_awesome drink
the taco be a decent portion and if -PRON- do_not eat ton -PRON- could see one order of taco and an_appetizer be enough to satisfy the hunger
if -PRON- be super hungry then -PRON- could see two order of taco do the trick
the multia be a special and pretty solid
-PRON- come with mole and avocado
all ingredient be blend well together and -PRON- love the freshness of the cilantro and onion sit on_top
-PRON- be a solid way to start the meal wash down with -PRON- version_of an_old fashioned
-PRON- follow_up with wait for -PRON- korean taco which come_out_quickly afterwards on a wooden board brand with the word tako
the taco be well make and do_not_skimp_on the ingredient
-PRON- be pack with flavor include kochujang and love the cucumber slice into -PRON-
-PRON- would_definitely_recommend ask for the housemade hot_sauce which add a nice kick to the overall dish
-PRON- wrap up with some lychee drink which be solid but the hummingbird at the end be the solid close
all in all -PRON- think this_place be great and
-PRON- be a fan_of what -PRON- be do
not_sure how easy -PRON- be to just swing by for a bite but definitely a place -PRON- will try to hit back up in the future
the bartender be also super_friendly and very_helpful
def a plus
-PRON- favorite party ever

-PRON- recently_move so -PRON- try howard 's ace on the south side of indian school and 32nd street
-PRON- be do a_few home repair on -PRON- own but do_not really know_what -PRON- need
-PRON- be greet as -PRON- walk_in and ask if -PRON- need help
boy do i-
-PRON- wish -PRON- remember -PRON- name but -PRON- walk -PRON- through everything -PRON- need and recommend a_few way to save money by purchase individual component vs. the pre package stuff that be mark up 100 for the pretty package -PRON- guess from the individual component
pricing at howard 's ace be also cheap by 50 on the pre package kit vs. -PRON- previous ace store on thomas
-PRON- have just check there and decide not to buy the kit because -PRON- seem ridiculously expensive
diesis restaurant empfehle ich nicht weiter
wir haben dies restaurant
-PRON- be gutscheinbuch gefunden
es ist leider einfach alle schief gelaufen
wir kaman in das restaurant und setzten un an einen tisch alle tische waren frei bis auf einer
dann kam die kellnerin und bittete un extrem unfreundlich aufzustehen und an den tisch direkt daneben zu gehen dieser hi sei reserviert den ganzen abend kam niemand mehr
die preise waren total überteuert
ich habe gyros mit einer ofenkartoffel und zaziki bestellt
die kartoffel war innen noch roh das zaziki hatte weder wirklich knoblauch oder gurken sondern übertrieben viel paprika
das gyros schmeckte wie ungewürzt dönerfleisch und sah auch so aus
es waren höchsten 8 grob geschnittene gyros
stückchen auf meinem teller
das gemüse war eindeutig fertig
buttergemüse aus einem supermarkt auch dies gemüse war fast roh
mein partner bestellte regatoni diese schmeckten nur nach käse und_die nudeln waren total verkocht
wir bestellten beide eine große cola die gläser waren aber nur zur hälfte gefüllt
der hund des besitzers lief
-PRON- be restaurant
hin und -PRON- und bettelte bei den
gästen nach essen
vor der tür liefen ständig männer hin und -PRON- die unsdurch die scheibe beobachteten mein essen dauerte eine geschlagene stunde bis es da war das von meinem partner noch eine halbe stunde länger
außer un war übrigen nur eine familie da
bei dem kleinen
mädchen der familie war das_essen innerhalb
von zwei minuten da war alle verdutzte
erst al das
mädchen fertig mit essen war kaman die gerichte von den anderen
am schluss bekaman wir noch ein klein gläschen mit einem getränk
da ich offensichtlich schwanger bin machte ich
mir keine gedanken um alkohol
mein partner trank zuerst und bemerkte eindeutig alkohol
1
bin ich offensichtlich schwanger 2
noch in der fphrerschein probezeit
ich habe noch nie erlebt das ohne zu fragen alkohol ausgegeben wurde
fazit
das_essen war ungenießbar und überteuert
die räumlichkeiten waren ziemlich ungemütlich das_essen braucht sehr lange bis es kommt be ende wird ohne zu fragen alkohol ausgeschenkt
wenn man dazu noch nicht gegen einen bettelnden hund hat ist man hi richtig
come_here the other day and have the
best
service
ever

the appointment availability be great which be why -PRON- kid go here as_well
the staff be funny nice and welcoming
dr. phen be very_nice and very detailed on what need to be do
from prior experience some dentist just recommend unnecessary thing to have -PRON- spend_$ but dr. phen be honest and truly care_about -PRON- patient
as long as -PRON- be live in nevada
all about beautiful smiles will be mine and -PRON- family 's dental provider
-PRON- truly recommend -PRON-
-PRON- have take -PRON- a while to get to write this review but the experience -PRON- have be definitely_worth note
stripsteak be the restaurant -PRON- go to every_time -PRON- go to vegas when -PRON- be look for a great steak
-PRON- have din here at_least a dozen time in the last few_year and -PRON- have yet to have a bad meal or one
that do_not meet -PRON- expectation
the last_time -PRON- din there be march second just prior to the carrie underwood concert as part of -PRON- birthday weekend
the experience -PRON- have be exceptional
-PRON- be very accommodate and the service be spectacular
-PRON- parent and -PRON- start the evening in the lounge for a couple of happy_hour drink special prior to -PRON- seating -PRON- arrive_early and prior to the opening of the main dining_room
the happy_hour drink be well price
once the main dining_room open -PRON- be promptly seat by the hostess and -PRON- server be present to attend to -PRON-
-PRON- be exceptional with any_question that -PRON- parent have and dietary request be receive well and honor by the kitchen
the duck fat fry be a nice change to the regular bread and butter offering of most restaurant
-PRON- order a bottle_of joseph phelps opus
one wine for -PRON- dinner
and -PRON- be exceptional but also costly
the wine_list be exceptional for a steak_house
well all have appetizer of salad
-PRON- always get the caesar_salad presentation change every_time and the the kansas city striploin steak
-PRON- parent opt_for a filet
all steak cook to perfection
-PRON- share a couple of side_dish at the table and be also excellent
-PRON- opt_for a desert beverage as_oppose to desert
-PRON- opt_for the adult root bear float which be likely kaluha and galliano with a scoop of ice_cream
nice and refreshing
though as -PRON- be a birthday weekend -PRON- do receive a complementary plate of ice_cream with happy birthday write in chocolate sauce
there be an element of sticker shock with a tab of over $ 1,000.00 but worth the celebration of a milestone birthday
as -PRON- be sure -PRON- have hear this_place be expensive as shit -PRON- all
honestly though -PRON- make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be worth -PRON- even_though -PRON- be probably not
the restaurant have great ambiance so -PRON- be generally very mellow and quiet in the dining_area
-PRON- recommend -PRON- bone in ny strip which be one of the good -PRON- have ever have
on another occasion -PRON- get a ribeye and instead_of medium_rare -PRON- get -PRON- practically blue rare
part of -PRON- be still good so -PRON- do_not say anything though -PRON- know -PRON- could have without issue
side be expensive as_well but be intend to be share with whoever -PRON- be with
make a reservation and come early for a drink or two at the bar while -PRON- set_up -PRON- table
great selection of liquor and not all that pricey comparatively speak -PRON- get a cognac
and -PRON- think -PRON- be only about_10 buck which be what -PRON- would pay just about anywhere downtown anyway
if -PRON- choose one of -PRON- specialty steak the waiter\/waitress bring_out a box of steak knife for -PRON- to choose one there be just two kind which be both hilariously superfluous and incredibly fun
take a date here for -PRON- birthday or valentine_'s_day
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- will regret -PRON-

-PRON- make all the food on_site and everything be fresh
-PRON- order the vegan platter and wrap and -PRON- be perfect
take -PRON- back to -PRON- family home cooking
the owner or manager be very sweet and kind
-PRON- choose this hair braid salon because -PRON- be close to -PRON- house and -PRON- be well know throughout charlotte
-PRON- should have walk_out the door when -PRON- start negotiate the price
-PRON- bring -PRON- own hair
the braider inform -PRON- -PRON- could_not get the cheap braid -PRON- have because -PRON- head would not look right with that size and -PRON- head would not be as full so -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to get a small size
this size be $ 165 plus -PRON- say since -PRON- wear -PRON- hair natural twa -PRON- would have to an_extra $_40
-PRON- let -PRON- know -PRON- hair be not that much long than what -PRON- see but -PRON- say the extra $_40 be not about how long -PRON- hair be -PRON- charge all natural extra because -PRON- have to braid past the hair
and -PRON- do_not have to do that with relaxed hair
-PRON- give -PRON- a $_30 discount for bring -PRON- own hair
everything be go fine until another woman show_up to braid the back of -PRON- hair
-PRON- braid just a_little_bit before -PRON- be call over to do another woman 's braid
-PRON- and the girl braid -PRON- hair decide -PRON- would switch up the new lady would braid the back of both head and the first girl would braid the front
to make a long_story_short
-PRON- be floored two week_later to find in the back -PRON- make big part with the same amount_of weave make -PRON- hair less full than -PRON- should have be and -PRON- do_not braid all the way down like -PRON- charge -PRON- for
-PRON- learn a lot from this salon
-PRON- be never_go_back and -PRON- feel_like this entire salon chain be a scam
-PRON- can_not wear -PRON- hair down because -PRON- be use to -PRON- braid be very full
-PRON- be a waste of -PRON- money
please do_not go to this salon
-PRON- will try and scam -PRON- for whatev -PRON- can
-PRON- even tell the lady -PRON- be braid awe fully fast in the back
-PRON- dismiss -PRON- clams and hurry up and put -PRON- hair on a ponytail without -PRON- review -PRON- work
-PRON- make the mistake of not address the issue before -PRON- leave but -PRON- take one for the team -PRON- welcome

great wholesale club but do_not come_here for tire
whatev money -PRON- may save be not worth the long_wait and terrible service -PRON- will get from the bj 's tire store
the tire be not in stock so -PRON- take one day for delivery
the clerk could_not be bother to call -PRON- when the tire arrive so then -PRON- wait over 3 hour for installation and -PRON- be the first one there

i mean i get -PRON-
-PRON- be cute -PRON- be stylish and -PRON- little one would look_like the cool kid on the block but i never realize that good child_'s clothing cost so_much
i know_how hard -PRON- be to find well design child_'s clothing
besides -PRON- typical soccer ball or puppy dog plaster shirt
i love almost everything in the store but -PRON- would have to be crazy to really justify spend that much on -PRON- child_'s clothing
oh -PRON- also have a woman 's section too for the stylish mommy
clothe that be to die for
i eye a very cute leather pleather
jacket by juicy couture should have figure
-PRON- be go for close to $ 800
ack
love the stuff but just ridiculous price
and even if i could afford -PRON- i do_not_know if i would
-PRON- be obviously market to the more wealthy crowd
before -PRON- begin this review -PRON- be go to preface -PRON- by say -PRON- take -PRON- a long_time to write this review due_to -PRON- extreme heartache and mistreatment by this animal_hospital
for those that do_not choose to read the detail below stay_away_from tropicana animal_hospital but most_importantly stay_away_from any animal clinic own by dmv james nave
-PRON- own a lot_of clinic all over the las_vegas henderson valley
-PRON- story
-PRON- initial experience with dr._nave be wonderful
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be very_knowledgeable honest as_well
-PRON- handle a not so favorable first_time visit to one of -PRON- other clinic in henderson with another veterinarian very well so_much that -PRON- choose to take -PRON- furry child to dr._nave as -PRON- be quite pleased_with -PRON-
at time -PRON- would see other dr 's due_to all of the pet -PRON- have at the time as_well_as the day time as dr._nave be not always available
the other dr 's
be just okay
the front_desk_staff be a hit or miss sometimes great other time not so great
while -PRON- have many great experience at this animal_hospital -PRON- have quite a_few negative experience hence the reason for the one star_rating
needless_to_say -PRON- spar no expense on -PRON- fur baby
and as most pet owner know -PRON- be quite expensive to bring pet to the vet
this be say -PRON- baby beagle 13 year_old develop a lump on -PRON- nose in between -PRON- eye
after multiple vet visit one of dr. naves senior vets suggest that the lump mass be surgically remove and send out for a biopsy
-PRON- be hesitant to do this however after much thought thus weigh -PRON- option -PRON- decide to move_forward with the surgery
-PRON- be well aware of the risk involve not to mention that if the surgery be successful the chance that -PRON- baby boy have nasal cancer be very likely
-PRON- be quote a low high price for this procedure
-PRON- baby be operate on and shortly_after the surgery be complete dr._nave call -PRON- to inform -PRON- that -PRON- baby be do good
-PRON- have just wake_up
the surgery go better_than expect
-PRON- be so relieved
then a second call come in shortly_after
-PRON- bad nightmare
-PRON- baby boy pass away
the following morning -PRON- come into the clinic to settle the final bill etc and to -PRON- surprise the receptionist give -PRON- a final bill that be near double the high quote
wow
not only be -PRON- have to deal with the devastating loss of -PRON- baby but now the cost nearly double
clearly something that the average person be not prepare for
-PRON- pay the high_end of the original quote and then set_up a $ 50.00 a month payment which -PRON- be not pleased about due_to the fact_that this be never discuss with -PRON- prior to surgery
-PRON- pay the majority_of the overcharged bill over the next several month and then -PRON- stop
-PRON- actually have to go on an extended business trip and forget but truly this additional cost be unacceptable and -PRON- should have never agree to pay
due_to -PRON- disappointment with -PRON- lack of integrity care -PRON- request that -PRON- pet record be send to another clinic and within day of that request -PRON- turn the rest_of -PRON- overcharged bill to collection
-PRON- call dr._nave to discuss this who by the way would not answer or return -PRON- call
-PRON- have -PRON- office help handle -PRON- dirty work
dr._nave eventually release the remainder of the so call money owe and take -PRON- out of collection however -PRON- inform -PRON- staff_member -PRON- point of contact that -PRON- pet be no_longer welcome in -PRON- clinic
how sad after 7 year of ongoing pet care
aside_from this -PRON- have other issue with this clinic prior to the death of -PRON- beagle 1
-PRON- utilize -PRON- kennel service anytime -PRON- go out of town
after return from one of -PRON- 5 day trip -PRON- handicapped lab mix be bring_out to -PRON- cover in -PRON- own urine
-PRON- be drip with urine
-PRON- immediately bring this to the staffing 's attention and -PRON- assure -PRON- that the manager of the kennel would call -PRON- to follow_up and of_course no one ever do contact -PRON-

-PRON- border collie have to take thyroid med daily
-PRON- prescription be fill at tropicana animal_hospital
-PRON- have come to learn that -PRON- be be short pill -PRON- husband would count -PRON-
when bring to -PRON- attention -PRON- would apologize and say -PRON- be a mistake
okay a mistake once or even twice but continually
-PRON- think not
dr. james nave should be ashamed of -PRON- for how careless and heartless -PRON- be along_with many of -PRON- staff

-PRON- arrive 10_minute early and be seat within 5_minute of give -PRON- name
-PRON- be seat behind another couple next to a corner window
-PRON- view be not as good as -PRON- but -PRON- be still good
-PRON- wait about_15_minute until -PRON- waitress come to ask -PRON- drink order

-PRON- do want to try the pastor burrito the next_time -PRON- visit
the pastor meat be on a rotisserie with pineapple and onion on_top
pretty_cool to see_how that meat be prepare
-PRON- use mavis winkle 's a couple of time a month to cater -PRON- meeting
-PRON- have always be satisifi
the food be good hearty and a_bit different_than the usual cater meeting box lunch
-PRON- have always be on time too

take maybe 2_3 minute for -PRON- sandwich to come_out although -PRON- be not_too_crowded and during -PRON- wait the affable owner chat with -PRON- about current event
so -PRON- experience with the staff be excellent -PRON- be friendly and efficient
the sauce come in a small plastic container so -PRON- understand the complaint about not enough but -PRON- ask for two container of different sauce and that be no trouble at all
the meat be cook_perfectly juicy and flavorful but could have use a_bit_more salt\/seasoning and -PRON- can understand the review that criticize the inability to taste the flavor of the rub
however the sauce be the deal here
both sauce be awesome and -PRON- all make for a great sandwich
-PRON- see someone criticize the slaw
-PRON- be creamy and excellent and taste fresh not_sure if -PRON- make -PRON- there will have to ask next_time
great experience
excellent food and -PRON- suspect all the dish be
a little_pricey at $_8 for a sandwich and side but overall the experience be great
-PRON- do_not understand call the food average for barbecue
this be well above_average even for carolina texas kc memphis etc
the sauce tasting area and the side also help
and the place -PRON- be not fancy but there be plenty_of clean table
-PRON- remind -PRON- of hundred of place in the south
look_forward_to go_back
-PRON- have be look_forward_to check this_place out

-PRON- get the family meal with roll and 2 side
-PRON- choose corn on the cob and mac_n_cheese
the chicken -PRON- be not bad but be not great
do_not really stand out but be edible
the corn be completely water log and flavorless and the mac_n_cheese -PRON- be sad to say be rather blah
the roll on the other_hand be pretty_decent

reasonably polished crowd
many place to sit if -PRON- have no vip table i.e. those planter ledge
the inside part be very crowded and smokey and pack but -PRON- be nice that -PRON- be not limit to the small interior
got here kind_of late
end_up miss guest_list -PRON- be on and have to pay

very good food and excellent value
-PRON- have be here 3 time and will_continue to come for a long_time
-PRON- highly_recommend this restaurant
-PRON- be reasonable to buy a car from
however -PRON- think -PRON- be really sleazy when -PRON- call when -PRON- lease end to try to buy the car off lease
the car have really low mileage and -PRON- make_sense to buy out so -PRON- call camelback where -PRON- buy -PRON- to find out how to proceed
the sale_person say -PRON- have to bring the car in and have -PRON- inspect for $ 699 before -PRON- could buy -PRON- off lease
for this -PRON- get nothing -PRON- would have to pay more if -PRON- want an extended warranty
the dealership should not have care_about the car 's condition
-PRON- be lease -PRON- and want to keep -PRON- by buy -PRON- out
the car never even have to pass_through the dealer 's hand just a buy out from vw lease to -PRON-
-PRON- ask the sale_person if this charge be standard and -PRON- swear -PRON- be
so -PRON- call vw leasing
and -PRON- say that no such thing be require
-PRON- end_up buy -PRON- out directly over the phone from -PRON- with no extra_charge
-PRON- turn_out and vw leasing confirm that this be just a scam by the dealership to take $ 699 for do nothing pure robbery
-PRON- have eat_here the past three visit to las_vegas will_continue to dine at beijing noodle no
9 on every vegas trip

the food be delicious and beautifully present all the more remarkable because the price be very_reasonable
while the cuisine be french the menu be varied enough to offer something to diner with most taste
-PRON- would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
wait
staff be not very_attentive to customer

-PRON- have eat several_time at jamie 's italian in the uk- fabulous food and value

first of all -PRON- order the half portion of tagliatelle shocked to get the bill and find that the tiny half portion -PRON- give -PRON- be only reduce to $ 13.95 from the full portion price of $ 17.95
-PRON- be expect $ 10.95 or $ 11.95 at most
total ripoff
also no basket of bread serve with the meal
the spinach ravioli have about 5 piece_of sad spinach float in a very very bland white sauce-$19.95
no spinach inside the ravioli either
tea be $_3.50
overall very overpriced and not one bit worth -PRON-
-PRON- miss famoso upstairs where the food be awesome and lunch for 2 be under_$ 30
service be also bad
-PRON- server be nowhere to be find and other server keep come by to tell -PRON- -PRON- would be there soon to get -PRON- order
-PRON- also never bring the bill another server show_up and apologize for -PRON-
do_not go here but try -PRON- place in the uk if -PRON- ever get there
apparently there be a burly sasquatch with a gun in the back that force the owner to stay open past 2_a.m. on saturday even_though the hour be only til 2
-PRON- know this because -PRON- be there and that be one cranky owner
if -PRON- would like miserable crankiness and horrifyingly bad service -PRON- invite -PRON- to go to this_place anytime and chat up the charming owner
to -PRON- credit the employee be not the owner
if -PRON- be -PRON- would want to punch -PRON- too

the final product be absolutely perfect in -PRON- eye
the bussle -PRON- make be remarkable and look beautiful with the crystal -PRON- use

all in all susan be a rockstar
-PRON- will_continue to use -PRON- in the future
excellent service and tasty food
clean
service be quick
sit area be not that busy but see many ppl come in for takeout
this be probably more like 2.5 star
-PRON- have always be suspicious of two hot tamales but give this_place a try because -PRON- be in -PRON- hotel
-PRON- have a sample platter to split with three dish chicken panuchos green corn tamale and plantain empanada
the plantain empanada be by_far the good of the three
basically the exterior of the empanada be a sear plantain stuff with a cheesy black_bean mix
-PRON- be top with a spicy sauce and a generous_amount of crema
delicious
-PRON- could have eat a whole platter of these
the other two dish be weak
the green corn tamale be more like a polenta in_term_of texture
the flavor be good but a_bit sweet even for -PRON- -PRON- love sweet
still top with crema and salsa -PRON- be tasty enough
but the chicken panuchos be inexcusable
the chicken be utterly flavorless
the avocado be nice and the radish add a much need bit of brightness but the chicken be so lackluster that -PRON- drag down the whole dish
the complimentary salsas be also weak none_of -PRON- have any spice and at_least two of -PRON- be extremely bland
service be friendly and efficient
cocktail be delicious and standard vegas price
a fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write_home_about
this goodwill be alright -PRON- have be to good
-PRON- selection be okay cleanliness be okay and organization be okay
all goodwill 's price be the same as_far as -PRON- know
the staff be helpful and -PRON- never have trouble find somebody if -PRON- need help
when -PRON- move to phoenix -PRON- have to find a new nail_salon for -PRON- pedicure and fancy be -PRON-
for a while
-PRON- be clean the price be reasonable and everyone be very_friendly
-PRON- always seem to be busy
so -PRON- get in the habit of call for appointment
-PRON- favorite tech be molly
and -PRON- would go in and see -PRON- every month
-PRON- do a fabulous job and be very_personable
-PRON- toe always look fabulous and the polish would last a good 4 + week
however one day last spring -PRON- call and be tell that molly no_longer work there
-PRON- say -PRON- go_back home out of state which -PRON- know be a lie because molly be bear and raise in mesa
anyway that tick -PRON- off not so_much that -PRON- be no_longer there
but that -PRON- lie about -PRON-
so -PRON- have never_go_back
-PRON- be a nice place and since -PRON- be always busy can only assume that the other technician do as good of job as molly
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- if -PRON- want a decent pedicure at a clean salon
the only other thing -PRON- have to say be
molly where be -PRON-
this be a very good inexpensive thai place in the middle_of the strip
-PRON- both have curry dish and the food be tasty and plentiful
service be attentive
bill for 2 be under_$ 40 with an app and tea include
decor be not fancy- expose brick paint a nice pastel shade high ceiling a couple of large potted trees-
but -PRON- be pleasant and calming
very satisfied with 1st visit here
jim and nick be super today
the baby rib be perfect probably the good rib -PRON- have ever have
the smoke chicken be always great super tender with great flavor
everything be unique at this restraunt from the lemonade and potato_salad to the pickle -PRON- serve
also the drive_thru be convenient for time when -PRON- need to bring something home for the family
everytime -PRON- come_back here -PRON- eat something new
carrot whoever think carrot be tasty but -PRON- be
-PRON- have the carrot risotto the lobster with almond sauce ravioli and sweet bread and octopus
yeah
-PRON- be like this weird surf and turf and for dessert a banana cake with ice_cream and chocolate sauce -PRON- be weak and really not on_par with the savory stuff
-PRON- find this_place extremely interesting and original
-PRON- come up with the most unsual combination of ingredient and when -PRON- think about -PRON- -PRON- be not clearly obvious why someone would put these thing together then -PRON- eat -PRON-
and -PRON- be like wow
really this make_sense why do_not people think of this
nothing be straightforward here -PRON- be always an obtuse and oblique interpretation as_usual
-PRON- be not say -PRON- have like everything -PRON- eat_here but some of the stuff -PRON- do_not like -PRON- can still see there be some thought put into -PRON- what the chef be try to do
that for -PRON- still get point even if -PRON- do_not like the dish
when -PRON- eat_here -PRON- can feel the intense passion for the food more so than_most other place -PRON- do_not_know who create the menu at this_place
but -PRON- be think -PRON- have to be someone so interesting
-PRON- know whatev let -PRON- have -PRON- fantasy
lol example from previous visit foie_gra and rhubarbe
foie_gra be torchon not sear -PRON- think the sear foie_gra would have be good sear shrimp with bone_marrow and orange miso sauce
this one be amazing
and this time carrot risotto with passion fruit sweetbread and octopus
the carrot risotto carrot in the sauce with carrot bit seriously could be the good risotto -PRON- have have the past_few_year
maybe there be too_much sauce or too runny as -PRON- say but -PRON- do_not_mind -PRON- taste great
-PRON- one only caveat be the shrimp be kind_of like those mini cocktail shrimp and -PRON- do_not add anything to the dish maybe a sear could add more flavour
the dish be amazing never think carrot could taste so good
the sweetbread and octopus
the sweetbread be crispy and octopus be tender garnish with peach slice string bean and mushroom
a pleasant dish fresh with contrast texture colour and flavour
very_nice
-PRON- promote this_place to be -PRON- new favourite french resto in mtl
the ravioli be much good meat be better salt this time around huge improvement over last_time and the ravioli texture be perfect
the lobster be so so do_not fly for -PRON-
fyi -PRON- just expand about 3_week ago -PRON- be now twice as big -PRON- take over the space next_door
come in here with the hubby for a nice dinner
be so_glad -PRON- come in here
food be phenomenal
service be great
only_reason -PRON- have 4\/5 star be because -PRON- do_not like how close -PRON- table be to the one next to the other
-PRON- want to get a jump start on celebrate -PRON- anniversary but feel_like -PRON- be have dinner with the 2 people next to -PRON- because -PRON- be so close
also just a head up that parking be valet
-PRON- do_not_know and feel bad because -PRON- do_not have any cash to tip the guy work the valet
overall -PRON- will be back to try the rest_of the menu
this_establishment be excellent
the variety_of food and the presentation of -PRON- make -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be on_vacation
-PRON- be decoration and design be very artistic and creative
definitely a place to enjoy for a reasonable_price
food be good but overpriced and no discount even if -PRON- stay_at the hotel
ambiance be more of a cafeteria type setting and server wear t_shirt
service be good
straight to the point
great selection of food and everything -PRON- try be tasty
self_serve drink coffee and hot_chocolate be also a nice_touch
the dessert be really well make
at $ 16.99 this be one of the cheap buffest on the strip but -PRON- will get excellent food value for -PRON- buck
-1 because -PRON- do_not see a large_selection of fruit
pizza suck
-PRON- ask for extra cheese pepporoni and sausage
-PRON- do_not get the extra cheese
the pizza taste bad
work lunch with the boss -PRON- decide to try a relatively new place right by the office
the merchant be a new bar focus_on seafood gastronomy with a_few classic pub fare to cater to the general clientele
the interior be clean contemporary with a lovely patio face adelaide street
for the main -PRON- take -PRON- server recommendation and try -PRON- in house traditional fish and chip
-PRON- have get to say bang for buck -PRON- portion be huge
luckily -PRON- opt to have more slaw then fry -PRON- be still unable to finish -PRON- meal lol
however the meal be delish fish be fresh and not_overly batter
fry be not oily and the slaw be awesome and definitely compliment the dish

-PRON- can see -PRON- be a real success over the coming month and year
-PRON- would_recommend -PRON- go along try the soup and when -PRON- have a little more time than -PRON- do succumb to temptation and let -PRON- tastebud run riot with -PRON- cake
illumilatte have be -PRON- go to place to see friend and -PRON- be also a very great place to do work or study
well -PRON- have be exceptionally pump about this cafe ever since -PRON- open due_to -PRON- illuminati theme
the interior be pretty hip and the wall art be iconic
sadly enough illumilatte use to sell large macaron with cool flavor but now -PRON- display case be full of dessert like normal sized macaron to rise meringue sandwich with chocolate ganache filling
-PRON- also have more fill thing on the menu such_as paninis and -PRON- just add salad onto the menu too
well -PRON- have have -PRON- signature illumilatte drink and despite the heat -PRON- do order -PRON- hot
-PRON- just taste delicious hot
the employee be super considerate enough to always add latte art and -PRON- always get a kick out of that
-PRON- have also have -PRON- ice green_tea latte java truffle frap cream frap green_tea frap with white_chocolate macadamia and -PRON- earl grey tea by the pot
the cream frap be by_far -PRON- most favorite and -PRON- order that every_single_time -PRON- come
-PRON- really_enjoy -PRON- time here
and -PRON- have actually never have a bad_experience with service or with any of -PRON- order
-PRON- definitely_recommend this_establishment
omg the soup
just go for the noodle_soup on the last page
i hate vegetarian restaurant that put some much soy crap in -PRON- meal and do_not serve vegetable
the soup be so full of vegetable
-PRON- make -PRON- unexplainably happy
-PRON- be also amazing that -PRON- get two\/three meal out of one bowl of soup that cost like $_4.50
seating be really nice
def not a hole_in the wall feeling
fast friendly service in -PRON- experience
the mock duck be a huge let down though compare to the lovely stuff at king in kensington
-PRON- love love love stash house
-PRON- experience here be always a fabulous one
-PRON- have have -PRON- nail do by jimmy and chica -PRON- be both incredible
-PRON- toe by summer -PRON- be as_well incredible
-PRON- be an_amazing team and be lovely to be around
-PRON- always leave more_than satisfied
-PRON- passion be show through -PRON- work -PRON- be all extremely creative patient and have the most beautiful soul
can_not wait for -PRON- next appointment
this be a cozy neighborhood cafe
very bright and cheery with the bright red decor and lot_of window
the place be quite busy when -PRON- be there for lunch on wednesday
service be great
quick and with a ready smile
the food be good not great but homey like mom would make
the potato_salad be top_notch
the presentation be a little bland or lacking very plain
dress up the presentation a little may make the overall meal seem more appealing and less sterile
price be a little high for amount and quality of food receive but again the fast and friendly service be appreciate
-PRON- would go again but not necessarily as a first choice
try this_place out for the first_time look for a place to watch the brewers
walk_in be not greet so -PRON- find -PRON- own table right by the door
table be dirty and -PRON- take just under 15_minute from that time to get notice and get -PRON- first beer
when -PRON- come over -PRON- never clean the table
server finally take -PRON- order for pizza supreme on thin rust and curd
curd be nothing to write_home_about
pizza crust be soggy except the very outer edge which fail in -PRON- book for thin_crust
the topping be not even cook and still raw
the sauce be bland and seem_like straight out of a can
the gal that be suppose to be -PRON- server never stop back to ask how thing be
and -PRON- finally get -PRON- second beer after an_hour of be there
-PRON- certainly will not be back so_much good at jordan 's big10
-PRON- have be to dunk n dip twice_now
-PRON- first experience be when -PRON- first open
-PRON- be give -PRON- a 3_star because good food nice location and good space
two thing that can be improve on be definitely service menu choice and pricing
for the size and the amount_of staff -PRON- have -PRON- group expect a_bit good service
-PRON- have to remind -PRON- twice to get cutlery and water both of which -PRON- have to mention as -PRON- do_not offer
there be several menu choice available however the selection be too wide and quite repetitive
this make order a little difficult as there be too_much to_choose_from
now for the good
the quality of the food as_well_as the taste be on point
all of -PRON- dish be just enough sweet and not overwhelming portion like a demetres cafe dessert
-PRON- do_not feel too disgusting to finish -PRON- plate
the ambience and the overall decor be great really modern and a young and hip crowd
this be a great place for a first date
overall the concept be great
the execution just need a little work but would_recommend try maybe on a less busy night
ahhh well char grill
-PRON- may be time -PRON- part way
just when everything seem to be go so well
separate incident on different visit have encourage -PRON- to take -PRON- dining out dollar elsewhere
1
minor but nonetheless irritate
-PRON- place an order for chicken tender
be not ask if -PRON- want the plain or season batter and get a young_man with an attitude who give -PRON- dirty look and rude conversation because -PRON- do_not_know the sauce for the chicken tender be call dipping_sauce
um no 2
there be also the incident where an_old gentleman take -PRON- order as_oppose to the young folk who usually do and get one of the condiment wrong result in a request for a new sandwich
and -PRON- tell the member of -PRON- dining party that she tell -PRON- the wrong condiment
which -PRON- do_not
-PRON- be stand there when -PRON- place -PRON- order
-PRON- be more likely -PRON- hear m and assume mayo instead_of mustard or think -PRON- hit the right key
either_way how do -PRON- sustain a customer base by accuse a customer and use a derogatory tone of voice
um no 3
on another occasion -PRON- go to the pick_up window and although -PRON- companion have -PRON- hand out for the bag a young_man work the window push -PRON- food across the counter at -PRON- and walk_away
um no 4
then there be the couple that come in with the dog
and the dog 's water bowl
and the guy hand -PRON- to a young_man stand at the register who fill the bowl from a sink in the general food prep area
um hell no
-PRON- be willing_to give the char grill the benefit of the doubt because sometimes thing happen
but the dog incident seal -PRON- for -PRON-
sugar and grease be ready
if that be what -PRON- like worst sangria ever pure sugar no taste whatsoever
bbq chicken sandwich drench in super sweet sauce can_not tell of the taste
really really bad bbq joint
-PRON- eat in a bowling_alley be not what -PRON- should tell people
-PRON- will look_at -PRON- weird like -PRON- have a shopping cart fill with cat and -PRON- clothe be cover in cat hair
that say -PRON- eat at a bowling_alley and -PRON- be awesome
and by awesome -PRON- mean -PRON- will want to slap somebody because -PRON- be that good
-PRON- will bring a deep violence out in -PRON-
maybe -PRON- be the crashing of pin or all the happy smiling face that make everything taste and feel so good
-PRON- do_not_know
but -PRON- do know that -PRON- have the good time
and -PRON- want to go_back again and again and again
the dip
oh
-PRON-
gawd
the dip
-PRON- have spinach and goat_cheese and -PRON- feel_like such a heifer for not want to share -PRON- with the 3 other people at -PRON- table
-PRON- do share -PRON-
but -PRON- want to take -PRON- over to a separate table and just pig out by -PRON-
hashtag thisiswhyimfat
-PRON- order the jucy lucy because who can resist a name like that and since -PRON- watch that one episode of man vs. food that showcas the jucy lucy
-PRON- will say that the burger be cook_perfectly to -PRON- taste pink inside -PRON- know most place will not do that
so this be quite a thrill but -PRON- lack the thick gooey cheese innard that -PRON- have see in other jucy lucy 's although maybe that be television magic
not a deal breaker or anything
and -PRON- would order -PRON- again
the hub get a chicken sandwich with apple and cranberry
-PRON- would not share but keep make happy noise
that be always a sign -PRON- be really good
-PRON- do snag a couple of -PRON- skillet green_bean and -PRON- be really good
so_many good thing on the menu -PRON- be hard to choose just one
so -PRON- will have to visit again
maybe -PRON- will bowl too ah who be -PRON- kid
-PRON- will just get more dip and pig out
-PRON- be surprised to see so_much negativity in many of the review
other that -PRON- know and -PRON- have never have a bad meal here
there be a wide_variety of item to_choose_from all of which be very fresh and keep at the right temperature
there be good asian food here than in any chinese_restaurant in the immediate area
high_quality ground steak be use for the slider
the pot roast turkey chicken and taco meat be top grade
if -PRON- go for dinner the steak be delicious
-PRON- dessert bar be second to none
yes -PRON- get a little messy because -PRON- be deal with topping and fudge and customer who be responsible for the mess that -PRON- be complain_about
the staff be extremely_friendly and all of the server not only work very hard but -PRON- be as effective and efficient as any -PRON- have ever see
without hesitation or reservation -PRON- would classify the service as exemplary
in_fact -PRON- would venture to say that the server not only do_not get the credit -PRON- deserve but be probably shortchang by most patron when -PRON- come to -PRON- tip
ask -PRON- this
when eat at a sit_down restaurant do the server make as many trip to -PRON- table as the one here do
if -PRON- want really good food at a price -PRON- can_not beat try this_place
to be fair if -PRON- have one criticism -PRON- be that the cook should not wait until 10_minute after food bin be empty to start cook up the next batch
easy lay_back place have not eat_here but drink be nice and gambling be ok
not great but ask the bartender and -PRON- will tell -PRON- what s hit
-PRON- have no_problem comp drink for a large tip too
quite_possibly the bad hotel experience -PRON- have ever have in_las_vegas
last april while visit some friend that be stay_at the monte carlo in_las_vegas -PRON- golf club get steal from the trunk while inside gambling
-PRON- should have learn -PRON- lesson then and never stay there again
after check in on friday -PRON- girlfriend
and -PRON- proceed to -PRON- room only to pass a group_of four individual with -PRON- door open have an orgy
-PRON- do_not_care so_much but -PRON- girlfriend be absolutely disgust
-PRON- ask housekeeping if -PRON- could let the people know to please keep -PRON- door shut
that night after gamble -PRON- come_back to -PRON- hotel room only to pass that same room do the same_thing
oh_well -PRON- be las_vegas
that night -PRON- could_not sleep because the people across from -PRON- parti until 9 am
-PRON- go down to the concierge and ask -PRON- if -PRON- could please switch room and -PRON- inform -PRON- that there be no room available be that -PRON- be halloween weekend
-PRON- do however tell -PRON- that -PRON- could upgrade -PRON- room to a suite if -PRON- want to fork out an_extra hundred and something dollar
no thank -PRON-
saturday_night be no different -PRON- have a terrible time sleep and just want to leave early sunday_morning and chalk this hotel experience up as a loss
sunday_morning as -PRON- walk to the parking_garage to grab something out of the car -PRON- see -PRON- be go
someone have steal -PRON- and -PRON- belonging as_well
-PRON- stupidity for leave valuable in the car
-PRON- call security and -PRON- call the aria security and both be try to convince -PRON- -PRON- mi park -PRON- car
after an_hour or so of try to convince -PRON- that -PRON- car be not miss park -PRON- finally go to the camera and see the truck -PRON- have drive in on friday and tell -PRON- -PRON- be right -PRON- do park in that parking_garage
-PRON- file a report and try to figure_out how -PRON- be go to get back to california the follow day
ultimately -PRON- have to rent a car monday_morning
this be by_far -PRON- bad_experience at any hotel -PRON- have ever have
have be here_twice and have have thing steal from the garage twice
if -PRON- be to ever go_back -PRON- would definitely have to be free and -PRON- definitely would not leave a vehicle in the parking_garage
good pedicure and pink and white nail around
-PRON- use liner in the foot tub and include hot stone massage for -PRON- foot for free
super_nice too
-PRON- remember -PRON- name even when -PRON- call to make_an_appointment
love_this_place what a hide gem
good price for bulk item
try to get -PRON- gas and car_wash here as much as_possible
customer_service be good
food lunch_special be really good
food sample be always excellent and again make -PRON- buy what -PRON- do_not normally want
but_hey the power of suggestion be need
this be -PRON- go to pho place in_vegas
-PRON- have try some other item besides the pho such_as the roast duck and bbq_pork and -PRON- suggest that if -PRON- want that just go to a place that specialize_in -PRON-
but if at 4 a.m. -PRON- be crave some pad_thai roast duck and calamari ring then this_place have -PRON- cover
-PRON- do have some pretty tasty item such_as the salt and pepper calamari spring_roll and egg_roll
but the main star here be the pho
-PRON- like to get -PRON- with brisket and flank
-PRON- have read other 's review about this_place and one of -PRON- give a 1_star for terrible food and poor service
which -PRON- will_admit a_few time
-PRON- have come in and -PRON- be not on -PRON- game with the broth or -PRON- have experience somewhat terrible servic
but that be because usually -PRON- be packed and people be just wait to get a table and with a full house -PRON- can get crazy for the staff
-PRON- have be come_here for a long_time now and overall for the price and taste -PRON- be great in -PRON- stomach and easy on the wallet
side_note
pho will cure -PRON- hangover
-PRON- buddy and -PRON- have our cure result may vary though from person to person
have eat at babbo and esca -PRON- be somewhat diappoint with b&b.
the food be alright and the service be fine
but -PRON- kind_of expect more from this high_end italian in_vegas
everything be cook_perfectly and -PRON- have no_complaint on that
-PRON- just find -PRON- to be
uninspired
-PRON- also seem to share many of the the same menu_item as enoteca san marco and carnevino
not bad -PRON- would just rather dine somewhere_else if -PRON- be drop this kind_of money
the vegas strip have plenty_of good option
be quick and convenient
-PRON- pretty_much get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- get a drink salad and slice of pizza for about $_5
salad be decent sized except the lettuce be hardly cut up leave huge chunk to contend with be -PRON- do_not give -PRON- a knife
pizza taste pretty_good unfortunately the top of -PRON- slide off the dough
-PRON- have plenty_of seating and outdoor_patio
lot_of tvs on which all play sport
so -PRON- be pretty happy about that
-PRON- will give -PRON- another try but have mild expectation next_time
fast american\/italian -PRON- suppose
chris do a repair at -PRON- place today and everything go very smoothly
-PRON- call around beforehand to get a couple quote
and -PRON- call the few repair company -PRON- find that be highly rat on_yelp
-PRON- choose chris because -PRON- price be slightly less_than -PRON- competitor and -PRON- review be good
no brainer
-PRON- be friendly and thorough with -PRON- explanation of what -PRON- choice be
-PRON- even talk to -PRON- about pro and con of do the repair and with what -PRON- apartment complex may do if -PRON- notice -PRON- have repair the carpet
-PRON- go_through with the repair and -PRON- look great consider -PRON- be a different piece_of carpet
-PRON- feel_like chris be extremely honest with -PRON- and set proper expectation
chris be professional and easy to communicate with
-PRON- highly_recommend -PRON-
along_with -PRON- wonderful food wood_fire olive be -PRON- favorite
nook kitchen be now serve bourbon flight just in time for fall
come_here to experience food of this kind for the first_time -PRON- wife want to come_here
but -PRON- keep say no
-PRON- do call -PRON- a p@ssy then here -PRON- be
-PRON- be empty no line up more the reason -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- should leave
-PRON- tell -PRON- to man up
and -PRON- have the first tasting of something
special
-PRON- love -PRON- kabob could_not stop
-PRON- go on to destroy and toss -PRON- wife 's plate in -PRON- stomach
then -PRON- swear to -PRON- that -PRON- would come_back next week with or without -PRON- wife
-PRON- open_late too
the salad_bar be a great deal with fresh_ingredient
-PRON- like the choice and the price be good
-PRON- have try some sandwich too and be happy
until today
the grill_cheese and tomato soup combo be nasty
the sandwich have no taste
just blah
the soup be luke warm and nasty
-PRON- have chunk and lump of -PRON- do_not_know_what
-PRON- be very_disappointed
-PRON- eat two bite and give up
-PRON- get to watch -PRON- wife eat -PRON- salad
so -PRON- guess -PRON- will just stick with that
-PRON- will have nightmare from that slop
-PRON- just come_back from bare pool
-PRON- be there thursday and friday_afternoon
-PRON- interesting to note how different the bouncer act compare thursday to friday
on thursday when there_s less people -PRON- will welcome -PRON- in and -PRON- only pay 20 dollar
on friday when -PRON- get more crowded -PRON- will act more snobby at the front tell -PRON- to come_back later and the charge double to 40 dollar
when -PRON- be there on thursday -PRON- be more mellow with everyone just relax
on friday though -PRON- get more crazy because of so_many people and so_many drunk
drunk and small pool do_not go so well
one drunk for_example be try to belly flop into the pool which be only about 3 foot high and crowd with people
-PRON- be also pour beer into the pool which be gross
so let get to the topless aspect of the pool which be the reason most guy will pay to get in
the majority_of the girl do_not go topless
on friday out of about 50 girl about 3 be topless
so if -PRON- want to see boob save -PRON- money and go to a strip club
the whole no more tan line gimmick be not work
-PRON- would say that the 3 girl who be topless be either from europe or hire model
-PRON- notice the more crowded -PRON- be mean the more drunk there be which mean the less girl who feel_comfortable take off -PRON- top
in conclusion 20 dollar on a mellow thursday be fun but 40 dollar on a crowd friday to see a pool pack full of drunk overprice drink snobby security and 3 out of 50 girl topless be a waste of money
-PRON- parent want to take -PRON- out for a nice dinner for -PRON- quarter century so pick this from the shortlist of restaurant that offer dinner prix_fixe menu
the place be tuck_away quietly on yonge between york mills and the 401 a wooden cottage with old_fashioned in the good way decor and surround_by garden
-PRON- can see why people would choose this venue for a beautiful summer wedding
the wait staff be knowledgeable of the menu and the service be impeccable which -PRON- guess would be expect for this type_of fine_dining and the price charge
-PRON- wish -PRON- be equally impressed_with the food as -PRON- be with the ambiance and service
unfortunately -PRON- find the food very underwhelming
the one more memorable item be the du jardin course which on that day be a refreshing tomato salad
-PRON- think the escargot be also pretty interesting though -PRON- parent be not fan
for the main -PRON- mom and -PRON- both have fish and -PRON- dad the boeuf -PRON- all agree -PRON- have better elsewhere
overall -PRON- have a good experience here for the occasion the service and the environment
-PRON- would_recommend come_here for summerlicious or winterlicious -PRON- get the experience for a less steep price which be more reasonable for the quality of the food serve
oh gosh what a nightmare
go to get a drink and appetizer before a concert at the smith center
the margarita -PRON- be serve ws horrible
-PRON- could_not even drink -PRON-

have to send that stinky mess back
no way be anyone go to eat that cr*p
just because -PRON- be happy_hour do_not mean -PRON- can try and get_rid_of food
ththat be go in the garbage
if that be not enough the waitress bring -PRON- a ginormous bill
oh -PRON- forget to take off the shrimp
and oh -PRON- forget to charge half price for the drink due_to happy_hour
scandalous really scandalous
shame on -PRON-

all of which be right on the money when all say and do
hector be patient and meet with -PRON- daily during the process to ensure everything be up to -PRON- standard
-PRON- be able_to find creative solution to problem other company tell -PRON- could_not be solve

the process be so good in fact_that -PRON- be have nevarez replace an_old worn out rv gate and also landscape -PRON- entire front yard
before and after picture to follow
-PRON- have no reason to look anywhere_else other_than nevarez landscaping

but really -PRON- be in_vegas
beer_selection be fairly standard with a pale red lager hefe and a stout with seasonal favorite available
-PRON- like the red and drink -PRON- a lot_of -PRON- when -PRON- hit the table
expérience plus que décevante
l'impression
générale est qu'il frappent au dessus de leur poid
prix vs la qualité portion et service décevant
l'entree de petoncle n'avait qu'une petoncle le boeuf avec les nouille style asiatique
ne devrait pas faire partie du menu d'un restaurant qui a cette réputation et ce prix
enfin au delà du look trendy si vous ête minimalement critique
et aimez bien manger plusieur autre restaurant offre mieux
this review be dedicate to one of -PRON- friend in cmu.the only spot which come to -PRON- mind when i say food be aladdin
-PRON- be never a great fan_of this_place until -PRON- last pittsburgh trip
the place be locate close to squirrel hill where i have -PRON- other favorite eat out
for some_reason i crave for hummus and decide to go here for brunch
as -PRON- enter -PRON- may be throw off look_at those huge yummy cake .i generally lose -PRON- appetite enter the place
mr
aladdin please change the location for -PRON- cake but i have hear -PRON- be amazing i be go to save -PRON- for -PRON- next trip
-PRON- order a falafel salad pita strip with hummus and a falafel wrap
-PRON- must_say -PRON- be great
-PRON- totally satisfy -PRON- hummus craving and -PRON- kinda fill -PRON- up
the place be kind_of tiny
but i be sure -PRON- would soon start a street call aladdin 's eatery;it be pack most of the time
the service be friendly and quick
and yes this be the place where i try middle_eastern food the first_time spiral in front of -PRON-
-PRON- be not dizzy -PRON- be a flashback for where i be 3_year back
-smriti
-PRON- love tea and -PRON- love teavana
-PRON- always have tea to sample outside and more inside
loose tea only last 10 13 day which be not very long at all
-PRON- say -PRON- will last up to a year if -PRON- buy -PRON- in the tin
so -PRON- never buy loose tea from here but -PRON- love come in to get a cup of hot tea
lot_of promotion for -PRON- own drink before and even during the show half empty theater late start short duration no band karaoke and lip sync loberace title be misleading sad video intermezzo clown swallow balloon strange boy george imitation corny joke too_much talking stage be too empty dancer
after three visit -PRON- can finally say that both the food and service be top_notch
-PRON- have only have the wing and fry macaroni bite but -PRON- have enjoy -PRON- every_time
the wing be large and cook well
the flavour -PRON- have try be honey_garlic bbq and honey mustard
-PRON- be a small clean spot with a_few table for dining in
-PRON- recommend -PRON- if -PRON- be in the mood for wing
cool little place nice atmosphere and staff
great coffee too go check -PRON- out
very_friendly front_desk_staff and helpful
love the room and the comfort of the bed
the attached restaurant have a nice staff and hood food selection
bar be also nice
very close to illini athletic stadium
other area restaurant within drive distance
-PRON- have be work out with this group for almost two year and have love every minute of -PRON-
-PRON- be a challenging workout and -PRON- see result right_away
the location be convenient
the coach be very supportive and attentive
-PRON- be a great way to get to know other mom in the area and have some adult time while the kid play
bad show -PRON- have ever see
luckily ticket be free so -PRON- do_not feel as upset but -PRON- be absolutely a waste of 2_hour of -PRON- life
the performer have talent but whoever write the show be lack
-PRON- be not_sure how -PRON- have last for 3_year especially on the strip
do_not_waste -PRON- time or money
-PRON- get to the drive_thru at what end_up be the exact time that -PRON- close
-PRON- do_not_know about this especially because -PRON- still take -PRON- order
but then -PRON- quickly find out when all of the kitchen come_out and give -PRON- really ugly look as though -PRON- purposefully hold -PRON- up and -PRON- be about to leave for the night
the good thing be -PRON- still get -PRON- food and -PRON- be fresh
-PRON- think the good part about this_place be that there be a drive_thru
the food do seem to have a lot_of msg in -PRON-
and -PRON- be bloated from the excess of sodium but the fry_rice be super delicious
-PRON- would probably go_back
go to toy shack get a leader class star scream out of box
-PRON- come a long way to find -PRON- -PRON- see -PRON- in the summer
and -PRON- be wait for -PRON- to come_back to get -PRON-
thank -PRON- gabby
-PRON- be so helpful
-PRON- have try bouchon in la and recommend -PRON- to a group_of friend during -PRON- vegas trip
-PRON- think -PRON- be decently_price for lunch and a much good alternative to some of the relatively more popular place to eat for brunch ahem mon ami gabi
-PRON- love mussel and the one -PRON- have in bouchon in la be some of the good -PRON- have have
thankfully the one in_vegas remain the same
-PRON- be a huge portion_size that make the $ 25.50 price_tag very worth -PRON-
-PRON- trick be to first eat the one that allow -PRON- to dig a little hole and reach the white_wine with saffron sauce
then -PRON- can eat -PRON- mussel and dip -PRON- french_fry into the sauce at the same time
pure deliciousness
-PRON- try some of the croque madame and smoke salmon baguette which be both outstanding
a friend also order the special of the day which be a pork_belly blt
service be a little_slow but -PRON- have a large_group and -PRON- do_not_mind that much
-PRON- be amazed at how identical the vegas bouchon and la bouchon look
uncanny
-PRON- really think this be the good sunday_brunch -PRON- will find on the strip grant -PRON- be look for a french style brunch and not a buffet
the price be probably a little more expensive but the food be so so_much good
-PRON- have be a bad yelper
bad bad yelper
-PRON- should have update this right after -PRON- appointment to keep -PRON- guy fill in no excuse
about a week after -PRON- visit -PRON- notice that -PRON- acrylic be peel
the acrylic be peel at the edge of -PRON- nail
that should not have happen
-PRON- try to call but could_not communicate well with the gal on the phone
all -PRON- get be what time -PRON- come in
um
no
-PRON- have since remember that -PRON- gal in key west wrap the acrylic b around the edge of -PRON- nail
-PRON- decide that -PRON- be now tired of try to find new nail place
bah humbug to that
so -PRON- let the acrylic grow out and be work hard to maintain -PRON- nail
then -PRON- discover jamberry nails
-PRON- be in love and will probably never_go_back to a nail_salon again
so happy with -PRON- jams that -PRON- think -PRON- be go to sign_up to sell -PRON-
plllt nail_salon
.pllt
-PRON- have be want to try this_place for awhile now since -PRON- right down the road from -PRON- house
but since -PRON- be not open for dinner or on the weekend -PRON- have never have the chance til today
-PRON- order -PRON- for lunch on a monday and have -PRON- deliver

-PRON- would_highly_recommend -PRON- just wish -PRON- be open for dinner so -PRON- husband can try -PRON- too
-PRON- just return from have christmas dinner here and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- opt to order from the regular menu rather_than have the holiday dinner -PRON- have make available
the setting be very_nice with great holiday music
the service be amazing- nadine be -PRON- server
and -PRON- be great
as for the food -PRON- be delicious- better_than flemings steak_house

the area of town be pretty hood
-PRON- have see some shady shit transpire both in the building and out front
-PRON- be on 40th st. and thomas what do -PRON- expect
the drink pour can be good or bad depend_on the bartender shane be rad and there really be not anything to grub on worth mention
-PRON- have some crappy fry bar food
but -PRON- still consider click be -PRON- go to pool hall
oh and -PRON- recently add a patio from which -PRON- can get -PRON- smoke on and watch the dumpster diver in action
high class ass if -PRON- ask -PRON-
a really really good korean spot to grab something to eat
-PRON- be also very affordable service be fast and friendly
nonetheless be ready to wait usually pack in this 30 seat restaurant
anyway -PRON- start with the korean crepe which be oily but taste excellent and crispy
then -PRON- go_through -PRON- kimchi kimbab hand_down the good kimbab in montreal
-PRON- have get since vancouver last and not least -PRON- get the korean poutine which be a poutine base with rice cake and kimchi --tasty and spicy
-PRON- be indeed very different from the regular poutine
one can get tired of this dish pretty easily thou
-PRON- should still fill one to two person easily
-PRON- hire this_company to do the pool and landscaping on -PRON- new home and -PRON- have be a disaster
first of all the landscape designer do_not listen to a single thing -PRON- say as -PRON- be much_more interested_in look for additional way to charge -PRON- money
then -PRON- be two month behind schedule on completion of the project
-PRON- continue to have issue with the work that -PRON- do
-PRON- have lose over 20 of the plant -PRON- plant and because the overseeded a young lawn -PRON- lawn never recover from winter
in_addition -PRON- improperly instal the pool cause -PRON- to leak water for month and cost over a thousand dollar
-PRON- have try to approach -PRON- about these issue but -PRON- continue to lie and make excuse
do_not use_this_company
-PRON- only care_about money not the quality of work -PRON- do
a 3_year update
-PRON- be still go to ivan
and -PRON- love how -PRON- be so accommodate especially with -PRON- parent
-PRON- parent be old and -PRON- dad have alzheimer
-PRON- be hard for -PRON- to remember thing and -PRON- mother who be also old do_not_know much about car
all -PRON- have to do be give ivan a call and tell -PRON- what need to be do
and -PRON- do without a problem
-PRON- can trust -PRON- to take_care_of -PRON- parent when -PRON- get there and make_sure that everything be safe
-PRON- also know that -PRON- will_never take_advantage_of -PRON- parent who be so vulnerable at -PRON- age
good food -PRON- order the beef platter for two
the service be good the waitress frequently check on -PRON- and help -PRON- if -PRON- have any_question
-PRON- be not a big_fan_of the look of the place
solid food here
-PRON- be generous with -PRON- pizza topping and everything taste great
-PRON- try several different pie and feel this_place be a keeper
-PRON- would not call -PRON- the good ever but -PRON- be good enough that -PRON- eat too_much
have the beef kabob plate and pistachio ice_cream
lovely with awesome service
not_sure -PRON- know_what medium_rare mean but the food taste fantastic regardless
combine the music of the beatles with the artistry and acrobatic of cirque du soleil and -PRON- get exactly_what -PRON- expect- a fantastic show
go see -PRON-
-PRON- will love -PRON-
eat_here_twice during -PRON- 3 day visit here in edinburgh
super_friendly staff fast service
-PRON- order the beef pork burrito quesadilla chip guacamole with pale ale beer
-PRON- enjoy the pork burrito the most and -PRON- 4 year_old son really love -PRON- quesadilla
definitely_recommend_this_place
unexpectedly good seafood in the dessert
raw oyster fly in daily
sweet corn hush puppy buttermilk pie wow
attentive staff
open_kitchen
this be a great place to get organic natural food product
-PRON- also have a large bulk section for staple like grain seed dry fruit granola etc
the hour be very convenient the location be right in lincoln square where there be plenty_of parking for both car bike
-PRON- be a nice adjacent stop from the weekend farmer 's market
the co op have a classroom\/art gallery for seminar and relaxing\/din when the seminar be not in session
there be outdoor dining_area which be great
when the weather be nice
-PRON- do have a habit of stop_by to have a coffee scone before -PRON- pick_up grocery
the place be lay_back clean
-PRON- be consistently an enjoyable experience
raise -PRON- hand if -PRON- know_what be the name of the bowl game that be play in_las_vegas every december
-PRON- do_not even know a post season bowl game be possible for a non win team
apparently -PRON- love to invite a 6 6 team like ucla bruin to come to vegas
-PRON- be pretty_sure -PRON- would_rather invite cal bears if -PRON- could
get ready here be the answer
-PRON- be here for the las_vegas bowl sponsor by pioneer
yep even wynn would not touched that
-PRON- be the disappointing ucla bruin vs the conference champ byu who incidentally lose to ucla 27 17 early in the season
the luster be take off a little whenever a rematch be schedule in a bowl game
the excitement have since be go with ucla manhandle byu with a full healthy squad
too_bad the bruin be decimate with injury and have to start the 4th quarterback of the season
the stadium be locate a mile off the unlv campus and a short drive from the vegas strip
-PRON- be a little confusing use the public transportation to get to the stadium as -PRON- barely get there on time
-PRON- almost do_not get to watch the first quarter due_to the staff 's confusing distribution of will call ticket
-PRON- be start to sweat bullet when the kickoff start
once -PRON- do get to -PRON- seat -PRON- be amazed on how good the ticket be
-PRON- be about 16 row from the sideline and be very close to the north end of the end zone
-PRON- be assign to the section with the ucla alumnus with a_few byu fan able_to buy the leftover ticket
-PRON- be delight as the ticket for that area would have be about $_50 for an alumnus
the stadium have about 40,000 seat for the game and be very cozy in_term_of close proximity to the field
-PRON- be perfect for a saturday college football_game or a monster truck event
-PRON- also hear that concert and high_school football championship be hold in this stadium
grant -PRON- have be to a_few high_school football stadium that be a lot big but with few seat as -PRON- also double as a track and field stadium
this be still a top_notch division -PRON- stadium
compare to other big venue that -PRON- have go to dodger stadium angel stadium rose bowl petco park in sd this stadium need to update on the restroom facility and maybe come up with a_little_bit more lighting around the stadium
just a little bright would be nice especially for a night game like the night -PRON- have
in_term_of concession stand -PRON- do have alcoholic beverage and plenty_of the similar stadium food around the country
the only_thing -PRON- can say be that the price be a_little_bit low than -PRON- think -PRON- be but -PRON- do_not want to spoil appetite as -PRON- have plan for a bellagio_buffet for dinner
-PRON- have a jumbo tron on the scoreboard for each end for live action and replay of crucial play
the only_thing that bother -PRON- be the announcer who have a monotone pitch voice
-PRON- need to spice up to get more excitement for the crowd
with an open air and the synthetic turf on the field this would be perfect for a fast high scoring game
alas with an inexperience quarterback for ucla and a byu team that take_awhile to fight off a tough ucla defense there be no high score offensive output
the game be actually very exciting and very close to the end
the fan be rock the stadium for both side and the game would eventually come down to the last play where ucla have a chance to win the game by kick a short field goal
-PRON- set_up a 28 yard field goal which be a gimme for the ucla kicker
-PRON- have see -PRON- kick a 52 yarder early in the game
here come the snap the place for the kick and the kick
-PRON- wish -PRON- could tell -PRON- the result of the game
-PRON- leave at halftime just so -PRON- could avoid the cold temperature and make -PRON- to the bellagio_buffet
-PRON- be starve
maybe the burger be good here but do_not have the chicken burger
honestly -PRON- could_not eat -PRON-
-PRON- like -PRON- server and service
the bun be cold and look old as if -PRON- come direct from a plastic bag
the chicken be so thick -PRON- have to cut -PRON-
and -PRON- be tasteless no flavor
-PRON- simply have be fry
-PRON- be give -PRON- one_star because
try -PRON- husband sweet_potato_fry and -PRON- be nice but also cold
-PRON- come_here think to beat the regular bad airport joint but next_time -PRON- just go to any of the fast_food joint
-PRON- be not crazy about the name
-PRON- read as public u.s. why not lowercase the u
-PRON- do_not get -PRON-
despite that bit of odd brand the food will not leave -PRON- scratch -PRON- head
-PRON- be good
the place have a hipster vibe
-PRON- be what downtown lv need along_with more delicious restaurant
open for breakfast lunch and dinner
-PRON- be affordable yet refine
good casual food that will not drain -PRON- wallet with an interior that be comfortable approachable trendy and cozy
the friendly young staff will gladly walk -PRON- through the menu and concept
after a couple visit several month apart -PRON- have get mixed feeling about the mixed berry muffin
the first_time -PRON- be a wonderful mix of berry in a soft squishy muffin with a crystalized sugar coating that add a nice contrast in texture
the second_time the muffin be dry and crumbly
there be plenty_of other item to like
the forbidden fry_rice $_13 look small but be enough to satisfy with tiny cube of pork mix in the toothsome rice cover in a sweet yakitori sauce
and -PRON- can_not forget about the egg on_top
after cut into -PRON- and mix everything together -PRON- get the full effect of all the component comb for a memorable dish
that be the lone savory item -PRON- try
-PRON- sweet_tooth get the good of -PRON- on both occasion
and -PRON- also try the brookie $_3 part cookie part brownie
-PRON- be the brownie that win out
moist chewy and dense -PRON- be the superior element of the two
the bourbon banana bread $_3 be good too
dense and cakey -PRON- be a fan_of the rich banana flavor the texture and the sweetness of -PRON- all which be not too extreme
the decor be great as be the cocktail
however the food -PRON- be not up to the standard -PRON- would expect for this type_of place
-PRON- have a calamari apperitizer that be inedible so -PRON- send -PRON- back
-PRON- have never actually send anything back before so that be say something
-PRON- entree be good but not great
overall -PRON- like many_other would likely return for the atmosphere and drink but not for a meal
-PRON- have always love poke bowls and -PRON- have try a lot_of -PRON-
for -PRON- above anything the freshness of the fish have to be good in order to be call good poke
the quality of the fish at yoshi burritos be actually pretty_good
there be also a lot_of add on which be great
-PRON- favorite be mango
there be not that many place that offer mango in -PRON- poke bowl
but -PRON- be really happy
-PRON- have those here
-PRON- also be very_generous with -PRON- add on so -PRON- definitely think -PRON- be get -PRON- money 's worth
if -PRON- check in -PRON- offer free miso_soup which be great because -PRON- complete the whole meal
-PRON- be also a lot_of food so -PRON- can always split the bowl between two meal
the staff there be also very_nice
would_definitely_recommend
pop in after a fitness class to hang_out with a friend to catch_up and just girl chat
first_off the service be amazing
-PRON- own a consulting firm that specialize_in educate business in the cosmetic medical field in customer_service so -PRON- preach -PRON- day in and day out
jon h be -PRON- server -PRON- think -PRON- be also the bartender and -PRON- certainly have the customer_service down
food be great and -PRON- do_not go 3 second with an empty glass
-PRON- be not much of a burger girl but there be so_many other offering include the most addicting homemade kettle chip
-PRON- will certainly be back
woohoo indeed
the good gelato in the city
-PRON- can_not have ice_cream or gelato
any where_else now since -PRON- be disappointed by the quality and taste
thank_goodness
-PRON- do_not live close to the shop or -PRON- would not fit into any of -PRON- clothe
friendly and helpful service
so_far 3 visit one take out experience
pho ga chicken not on menu but accommodate when request
portion small and food $_1 2 more expansive than_most
good spring_roll not worth stir_fry flat noodle pho so so
service need a lot_of training like remembering to provide utensil at table or in takeout
the place have no competition 4 mi
radius
-PRON- may either succeed or go out of business be next two year or less if -PRON- do_not improve -PRON- business method
good_luck
good burger and service but disappointed in the cheese
everything_else taste so fresh and -PRON- even post which farm the potato come from

love -PRON- pickle radish and seaweed_salad
just recently start make -PRON- own miso salmon and -PRON- have a ridiculous amount_of miso selection that -PRON- take 15_minute to decide which one to purchase
oddly enough -PRON- good part of greenland be that -PRON- have a food court outside of the grocery_store that -PRON- can eat various asian\/korean food before buy -PRON- grocery
from the food to the service this_place be just meh
-PRON- get the 3 brewers burger and -PRON- be not very good at all
-PRON- love onion

the service be also not very good the lady do_not even try talk to -PRON- until -PRON- be pay the bill
-PRON- get a pint of the white beer -PRON- make
and -PRON- be okay

but -PRON- love_this_place
the best ice_coffee hand_down
-PRON- be amazing and the woman_who runs\/own -PRON- be adorably sweet
-PRON- be addict
-PRON- do_not like the service -PRON- receive and
the place be so tired and gross
-PRON- room be not ready
so -PRON- wait in the center space
the table smell sour and the wifi be spotty and the music be so loud and obnoxious
-PRON- sound_like -PRON- be prepare for a dance party
-PRON- ask the front_desk if -PRON- would turn down the music -PRON- be the only person in the whole place and -PRON- say -PRON- would not even know_how to do that so no
unacceptable
-PRON- room be tuck_away in a back corner
so -PRON- be quiet except for road noise
the bed be comfortable but the rest_of the furniture be so tired and gross i do_not want to sit on -PRON-
not up to the hilton standard for sure
overall experience be decent
-PRON- cashier be aaron who do_not have much costumer service or interest in -PRON- experience
be first_timer -PRON- be not_sure about what to do and -PRON- leave -PRON- without direction
-PRON- pedal boat have a broken pedal on the right hand side that come on and off
however the price be competitive and 10 off for asu student
go around 10:40 on a saturday morning and not much traffic with easy_parking
love_this_place
the menu and picture look amazing
only_thing be -PRON- be out of fresh coconut juice other_than_that -PRON- be almost perfect
company like this prey on our community and should be shut_down
no one of color should support after see_how -PRON- treat tiffany
if -PRON- stomp on -PRON- foot -PRON- will stomp -PRON- out of business
-PRON- have be eat mexican_food for 50 year mostly on the west_coast
last_night -PRON- be in_phoenix and -PRON- colleague who live there suggest eat at abuelo 's
the building be elegant with very_nice decoration and wall mural
good enough to take a date
-PRON- order the marinate steak fajitas while -PRON- colleague and -PRON- wife order different item
service be excellent
and so -PRON- be all three dish
-PRON- marinate steak be and -PRON- do_not exaggerate the good -PRON- have ever have
really
-PRON- all agree on a 5_star rating for this_place
this review be for the peoria location the only one -PRON- have try
jenna be extremely knowledgeable in both hair design and color
-PRON- listen to what -PRON- want and make recommendation when -PRON- do_not that be always spot on
when -PRON- leave the salon -PRON- feel polished and like -PRON- happen naturally
which -PRON- do_not
plus have to sit in a chair with a funny smart kind woman for an_hour or two make the who experience great from start to finish
highly_recommend jenna
so -PRON- have start to come to the realization that -PRON- be get old
what be -PRON- that make -PRON- start to accept this fact
the two day hangover
the two day hangover be very similar to the one day hangover include the craving for some of the greasy not good for the pool body food -PRON- can find that be where lobby 's come into play
after another long but epic weekend in old_town -PRON- find -PRON- reminisce about the blurry weekend with -PRON- coworker on monday_morning
the next thing -PRON- know lunch have arrive
with that two day hangover still linger for both of -PRON- -PRON- agree grease be the answer
thank to fellow_yelper -PRON- come_across lobby 's on the top ten hot restaurant
now -PRON- work in tempe and the food selection in -PRON- opinion be far_from stellar
so -PRON- when -PRON- see lobby 's only a_few block from the office -PRON- be sell
now -PRON- be a california guy grow_up in
nor cal so no true passion for midwest food other_than the fact_that every_time -PRON- have have -PRON-
-PRON- be happy with the result
this be no exception
-PRON- walk_in and be greet_by the owner
-PRON- look_at the simple yet delicious look menu and just stare
-PRON- can tell -PRON- be have some trouble so to ease -PRON- pain -PRON- suggest a full spicy italian beef sandwich full dip with fry and a drink
without hesitation -PRON- agree
this by_far one of the good italian beef sandwich -PRON- have have
the beef be tender the bread be great and the spicy pepper give -PRON- the kick -PRON- need
-PRON- know the full dip be the classical way to go
but -PRON- would probably go california style next_time and get the au jus on the side get a little to soggy for -PRON- taste
honestly if -PRON- could make up cool phrase like guy fieri do on triple d
-PRON- would use everyone -PRON- have here
this be a must hit in the east_valley
sorry luke 's the competition have arrive
-PRON- stop_by here during a road trip and leave as completely satisfied customer
location situate on the main road with easy accessibility by car and foot
there be two drive_through lane so be sure to check which line be short before pull in
there be also an ordering counter in the front with about 4 outdoor table
ambience really lively environment with techno music swedish house mafia play in front of store
even_though -PRON- be 10 be
-PRON- feel the music give a nice boost to -PRON- energy in_addition to the coffee
customer_service dutch bros be know for the friendly and and conversational service and this visit do_not_disappoint
the person_who take -PRON- order be name helen and -PRON- be super_friendly and help -PRON- pick -PRON- ideal drink as -PRON- first_visit
-PRON- notice customer in the drive_through strike up conversation as if -PRON- be regular_customer
drink delicious
-PRON- order the kicker and the dutch freeze which be delicious
the kicker be a little sweet but that be expect give the irish cream
price be very_reasonable as_well
conclusion overall great location ambience and customer_service that be fit for a small town
will_definitely_come_back to this_location again
unfortunately there be no dutch bros south of merced in california
hopefully -PRON- will open one in socal soon
here for -PRON- first_time yesterday with the girlfriend
the dim_sum be very good -PRON- come over right_away with the cart
-PRON- both have a noodle_dish and share some veggie spring_roll
-PRON- have the singapore noodle with veggie and add chicken do_not remember what -PRON- get
-PRON- be spicy and yummy -PRON- be a little salty but good
service be good nice and quiet
will be back
go to get a coffee before -PRON- get some errand today
want to get a dirty chai
-PRON- boyfriend have be here before and tell -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- grief the last_time -PRON- ask for one
and to -PRON- shock -PRON- have expresso and -PRON- have chai but say -PRON- could_not make -PRON-
and after tell -PRON- to just add -PRON- to the chai.the barista hesitantly say ummmm -PRON- can make the chai and the espresso
but -PRON- have to pour -PRON- in
and at the end -PRON- have chai and a cup of espresso separate -PRON- have to pour in as if -PRON- be a barista sin to mix both
this_place be pretentious yuppie hipster hang_out with no customer_service
-PRON- hate this fake wanna be new_york undiscovered hang_out -PRON- reek of
good coffee bad service
think -PRON- be hard to mess_up fry chinese_food
-PRON- be wrong
have the egg_roll crab rangoon and general tsaos chicken
no flavor and no spice
may be cheap
but will_definitely not order again
this_place have go to the dog and kid
first camden summit allow all dog
-PRON- claim there be breed restriction the only dog list by name be the pit bull terrier but as long as -PRON- can get a lease on an apartment -PRON- will let any dog live here regardless of size or aggressive behavior
-PRON- know for a fact_that there be at_least three pit bull terriers on this property
the office say that if resident do_not tell -PRON- how the office could know or the resident could just say that the dog be a different breed no one would ever know the staff be not akc judge
next most of the dog owner be horrible
-PRON- leave -PRON- dog on the patio\/balcony all day and some night and allow -PRON- to bark constantly
tenant rarely pick_up after -PRON- dog -PRON- may be because the property do_not stock pet waste bag regularly or just because -PRON- be lazy
the property do have a groundskeeper but -PRON- seem -PRON- only work part time there be no way one person can clean up after hundred of dog defecate multiple_time a day
because of this there be dog waste everywhere
also many dog owner let -PRON- dog out off a leash
-PRON- be nevada state law that all dog must remain on a leash and under control
-PRON- be not uncommon to see a rottweiler pit bull or a german shepard roam around without an owner in site
-PRON- assume -PRON- will take a child get mauled before camden summit will enforce the rule
-PRON- will be great when the official word from camden summit will be -PRON- have_no_idea this be go on -PRON- would have do everything in -PRON- power to stop the offender before an_accident like this could happen
all the staff see -PRON- -PRON- have bring -PRON- to -PRON- attention but -PRON- be terrified of confrontation so -PRON- never say anything coward
also the kid in this neighborhood be out of control
the parent be either not home
or -PRON- simply do_not_care where -PRON- child be or what -PRON- be do
-PRON- be like roam pack of hoodlum
always yell scream curse throw rock at building car dog and people break tree bush and fence constantly bike skating scoot in front of car assume driver can stop in time
again -PRON- will only be after a child be hit will the parent and the property be concern
this use to be a nice place but -PRON- have go way downhill in the past six month these horrible tenant have run off all the old staff
not one person_who work here now be here just a year_ago
and the new manager and staff be either incompetent or simply do_not_care how bad this neighborhood have become
at this point -PRON- will not renew -PRON- lease and -PRON- should look elsewhere to live if -PRON- value -PRON- sanity
have a great lunch there with friend
very fresh indian dish and some unique variation that have amazing flavor
go for dinner aug 2012 at the roof patio
food be ok for a pub -PRON- guess standard menu with no surprise and fair dish
service be below_average
too_many tv set around for a patio
small separate place in the back for smoker not too friendly for a big open patio
bit_overpriced as_well would_rather spend that amount_of money to go a restaurant try a new dish or better cook
overall average rating although -PRON- look great from the street view
tiger bbq serve more_than bbq
any dish -PRON- think belong to north eastern china -PRON- can find -PRON- here
of_course a lot_of the dish can be quite spicy the menu do_not mark any of those dish off with pepper symbol so proceed with caution
-PRON- waitress be nice enough to ask -PRON- if -PRON- can eat spicy after -PRON- take -PRON- order
lamb skewers $_4.50 only come in an order of 4 be delicious
a good mixture_of fat and lean the texture be tender
a good dash of spice
cough cough
jello $ 4.99
川北凉粉 jello have a more doughy texture the sauce be well balance with soy_sauce peanut and hot_sauce
menu be diverse include bbq fish in hot_pot and even bbq whole rabbit and some exotic organ of cow talk_about head to tail
cash_only
lgo
-PRON- give -PRON- prop bc -PRON-
keep -PRON- real and do something_different
from the food to the atmosphere -PRON- be truly original here in the valley
this_place be great for a number_of thing from bfast to lunch to wine to cheese to dessert to grocery
the list go on and on
the open market style of this_place make -PRON- so_much cool than so_much around here
breakfast
pretty_much everything be delicious healthy and make extremely well\/fresh
if -PRON- be in a healthy mood -PRON- def recommend the daybreaker

if -PRON- be in the mood for something a_bit_more tasty -PRON- love -PRON- croque madame
lunch
all the sandwich be great
not too big so a good place if -PRON- be look to keep -PRON- light and again plenty_of healthy and fresh option
-PRON- like the blt w\/ guac
salad be all premade but most_likely daily
and -PRON- have always have a fresh_tasting one
by_far -PRON- favorite be the chopped turkey
all the ingredient blend so well and -PRON- be big enough to fill -PRON- up
dinner
-PRON- guess the pizzeria next_door be separate but -PRON- will just include -PRON- here
pizza be great nothing -PRON- would want to make a special trip to lgo for but def something to keep in mind if -PRON- be there during lunch\/dinner and if -PRON- feel_like pizza
very light and flavorful and love that -PRON- get option for cheese
check the bottom of the menu
def not the good gourmet pizza but a good one
crust on the pizza be great slightly crispy and great dough
cheese\/dessert cheese
great option here
and the good part -PRON- get to sample
if -PRON- do_not_know the little plastic container next to almost all cheese be for -PRON- consumption
grab a toothpick and taste away
then turn 180 and grab a bottle_of wine
dessert be all make fresh from the bakery next_door and offer not only great taste but awesome design
check in for a review on -PRON- soon
as -PRON- can tell lgo offer so_much that -PRON- should make -PRON- a point to stop in for anything food wine cheese candy etc and just check_out the whole place for -PRON-
a cool and trendy crowd always in attendance indoor\/outdoor\/patio seating and great chill music
get to love a little jack johnson and an orange pellegrino on a nice morning in az and congrat on the la location -PRON- know -PRON- get love from -PRON- on that
the reason -PRON- give -PRON- 4.5 not 5_star be bc
-PRON- think -PRON- could do a little good with the bread option for -PRON- sandwich
-PRON- do have amazing loafs for sale
so maybe -PRON- should start use those as choice bc that would def make all -PRON- sandwich just taste that much good
please improve the cleanliness of -PRON- room and sanitize -PRON- hotel
-PRON- need good customer_service who can pay more attention to a customer 's concern without give -PRON- attitude in what she can do for me
-PRON- ask for the hotel manager that night because the house keep grave yard manager in charge that friday_night october 4th am in the morning be not compliant as -PRON- expect -PRON- to be
-PRON- find a cockroach in -PRON- room next to -PRON- head on the couch
-PRON- say there be nothing -PRON- can do to make -PRON- stay better other_than send a house keeper to come up to kill the roach
-PRON- do_not offer -PRON- a good room nor do -PRON- address -PRON- concern or offer any sort_of compensation or upgrade until -PRON- request for the hotel manager and make -PRON- conversation awkward because -PRON- keep ask -PRON- be -PRON- serious
there be nothing -PRON- can do
when -PRON- call front_desk about -PRON- all -PRON- do be inform -PRON- that housekeeping be on -PRON- way
housekeeping take 15_minute to reach -PRON- room and by that time -PRON- have to kill -PRON- before -PRON- reach -PRON- bag and luggage because -PRON- start to walk downwards off the wall to the carpet
this make -PRON- think how unsanitary this_place be
-PRON- walk barefoot on the carpet
-PRON- sit on the carpet
how do -PRON- know if these cockroach lay egg or lay dropping on the bed carpet and the fact_that -PRON- can crawl into -PRON- luggage in the middle_of the night be absolutely disturbing
-PRON- do_not need to bring cockroach home and infest -PRON- whole house because of rio 's cockroach situation
-PRON- be on the 3rd floor
can -PRON- imagine how large of an infestation of cockroach -PRON- have on the first floor in -PRON- kitchen and restaurant
-PRON- eat at those restaurant
-PRON- have be a loyal_customer to rio since -PRON- can last remember and this type_of situation and customer_service need to be bring up to human resources
have -PRON- not ask for the hotel manager -PRON- would have not get another room
the weird thing be -PRON- end_up to be the last room down the long hall ever on the 14th floor
be that a coincidence or on purpose because -PRON- find a cockroach in -PRON- room
the hotel manager should have give -PRON- a suite or some_sort to make -PRON- forget what -PRON- experience
either_way thank you to the hotel manager who give -PRON- a new room
-PRON- will ignore the fact_that -PRON- be the last room on the hall
as for the grave yard house keeping manager that night -PRON- need a good coaching or write up for be the most unfriendly manager at rio
-PRON- will post this on social medium site thank to -PRON-
always quality work- zipper hemming and stitching
great price and quality service
-PRON- go there for a friend 's_birthday party
the decor be very different -PRON- feel_like -PRON- be in one of the girl clothing store modern luxury feel
the food be pretty_good for -PRON- be price
-PRON- have salmon salad burger and hanger steak
the steak come_out cold the first_time but the chef apologize and go_ahead make -PRON- a new plate right_away
the service be good
but -PRON- be slow
-PRON- server be nice but everything come_out the kitchen be just slow
-PRON- have not do many buffet in_vegas
-PRON- be too into food -PRON- think
-PRON- be a problem
however -PRON- friend 's dad swear by this buffet in paris
-PRON- be still not big into buffet but -PRON- will give -PRON- review
$ 24 for the buffet and $_11 for bottomless drink
if -PRON- gamble just save the $_11 and go sit_at a table or slot
-PRON- will have a couple of mediocre drink and be on -PRON- way
plus -PRON- wait in line for 15_20 minute so -PRON- tend_to want to eat and go about -PRON- day
-PRON- have get food from all over the world
this be -PRON- theme or attractiveness
-PRON- have nothing that surprise -PRON- with pleasantness
-PRON- would_recommend get small_portion at each station
so -PRON- can taste a variety
-PRON- friend do_not do this and end_up have one tall hodgepodge of a plate
plus -PRON- may as_well taste -PRON- all incase something do entice -PRON- tastebud
the seafood be supremely overcook
the mussel have the consistency of smoke oyster
the clam be stick like chuck to the shell and if -PRON- pry -PRON- out -PRON- will end_up chew some shell
woof
the meat be tough and dry
and overcook
get some cocktail shrimp
that be a safe good thing
there be a station that be savoit something like that sorry and the veggie be ok
there be a tomato salad that be also very ok
-PRON- could have use more reduce balsamic reduction
this be all a reach
-PRON- be not good
this do_not turn -PRON- dislike of buffet around
finally check_out -PRON- store in kensington market
-PRON- work always have a popcorn bar cater from this_company so -PRON- already know -PRON- would love -PRON-
-PRON- have ton_of flavour and -PRON- can try -PRON- at -PRON- all at the store
-PRON- will_definitely visit again
-PRON- come_here with -PRON- mom before blue man show a way back
be here about 3 time altogethere
nice price
a
quite_possibly the good new_york style pizza -PRON- will find on the west_coast
if -PRON- have deal with sub_par ny pizza around_town come to this pizza place and -PRON- will not be disappoint
as -PRON- walk_through the vintage italian album collage lead to pizza paradise -PRON- will find a_few gem include an_old san remo cover before find -PRON- cheesy reward
-PRON- use cornmeal to crisp the crust and the cheese be stringy and delish
-PRON- feel_like a pizza speakeasy amid so_many trendy restaurant on that level inside cosmopolitan but well_worth the mystery hunt to get there
the dump
great name but misleading
-PRON- be expect to find very inexpensive furniture pile high on_top_of -PRON- in some musty old building
the kind_of place where -PRON- really have to dig to find that hidden treasure that be really a steal
wow be -PRON- wrong
-PRON- preconceived notion be shatter the moment -PRON- pull into the parking_lot
wait a second this be the old costco home
-PRON- must have only take part of the space
nope
the whole building apparently about 5 acre of space
maybe -PRON- be a_bit big and nice than -PRON- think
but with -PRON- be so large -PRON- be bind to find some thing -PRON- break a$ $ can afford
once_again
nope
-PRON- do_not mean to say that -PRON- be overprice
but -PRON- be surprised that -PRON- be carry brand like century furniture
definitely a high_end brand
-PRON- guess -PRON- be just expect something_different
after a few_month -PRON- think that -PRON- will start carry some brand that do_not cost so_much
after all tempe be not the high_end center for furniture that -PRON- apparently think -PRON- be
-PRON- be only open on friday saturday and sunday
apparently the rest_of the week be spend replenish stock from what sell over the weekend
-PRON- have be think about change -PRON- review from 3 to 4_star since a lot_of -PRON- disappointment be base_on preconceive notion
-PRON- have decide however that with a name like the dump -PRON- set -PRON- up to be look_at a certain way
therefore the 3_star stay
everything about this restaurant be meticulously plan with the customer experience in mind
from the mural on the wall to the staff and server every bit of the place make -PRON- feel care for and entertain
the owner be also always present and willing_to talk with -PRON- about -PRON- experience
the food be flavorful and consistently delicious and -PRON- have never have a bad meal here
this be -PRON- favorite indian_restaurant in_phoenix and -PRON- be sure -PRON- will love -PRON- too
good variety_of paint brush and supply than other art store in the area
-PRON- have necessary supply for art student and serious artist but -PRON- have crafty stuff and creative toy and stuff like that
-PRON- would be a good place to get stuff for -PRON- kid to work with or even a group_of adult who want to do a craft night
-PRON- do good framing also
experience vary day to day depend_on staff
some staff be the good in_town and provide the high_level of customer_service
other staff_member well
-PRON- leave a lot to be desire with inattentiveness be a key factor
-PRON- dinner at bravo bistro be fair
nothing_special nothing to go out of -PRON- way for
the appetizer portion be small
calamari be very_tasty but only provide a_few bite
-PRON- order the linguini in clam sauce
adequate portion but sauce be tasteless
no garlic flavor watery and bland
the stuff eggplant be also bland
-PRON- order garlic_bread for some flavor
what come_out for $ 4.00 a serve be small melba toast like round crusty piece_of dry out bread
the service be great and attentive but if -PRON- want flavorful interesting food -PRON- will have to go_somewhere_else
gentlemen frank be -PRON- guy
skilled frank wield scissor clipper razor blowdryer and hair product like the veteran pro -PRON- be
experienced want a standard cut
frank know -PRON- all and -PRON- will get -PRON- do with no goddamned nonsense
well except for a nice shampoo first
who do_not like a nice shampoo
attentive and creative look for some tweak to give -PRON- a personal touch or to reflect the late style
at little frank'll do ya
frank can probably out talk anyone but -PRON- be also a good listener and -PRON- be flexible and well creative
tell -PRON- what -PRON- be look for and if -PRON- be smart -PRON- will listen to -PRON- thought on the matter
repeat visit mean -PRON- will become familiar_with -PRON- hair type and dumb old head shape and may sensibly encourage -PRON- away_from or towards certain cut or style
but if -PRON- be completely convinced that -PRON- want that cut from inglorious basterds that all the vest wear embeard hipster be try to pull off right_now -PRON- will give -PRON- to -PRON-
reasonably_price do -PRON- like -PRON- stylist cut at barber price
then why not tip the man
great food great service great view
the ravioli the only vegetarian_option be amazing
the steak be also very good
of_course this_place have the good creme_brulee in_town
for many_year pnc park have be the home of the struggle pittsburgh pirates and -PRON- have witness more_than a_few loss here during that time
fortunately -PRON- seem_like thing be finally change this year knock on wood repeatedly
unfortunately -PRON- trip to the city this week just happen to be during the all star break so -PRON- be not able_to catch a game at this beautiful ballpark
regardless -PRON- still take the subway over to the stadium to walk_around and take some picture
with the pittsburgh skyline visible over the outfield and great seating and food vendor throughout -PRON- be no wonder this be consider one of the premiere ballpark in the major league
-PRON- be a much needed and serious upgrade from the old three rivers stadium rip which host both the pirates and the steelers for decade
do_not want to worry_about parking

-PRON- main dish be decide before -PRON- step in the door
-PRON- want some biscuit and gravy
the gravy have a creamy savory flavor to -PRON- however -PRON- use -PRON- stock biscuit for the base
the reason -PRON- think this be not the good idea be -PRON- be sweet than usual
what this seem to do in -PRON- opinion be clash with the gravy

-PRON- would do -PRON- well to server -PRON- sweet biscuit on the side with that apple butter of -PRON- which be delightful in -PRON- own right and get a standard biscuit for dish like this
some people seem to have have trouble with -PRON- service

even_though -PRON- do_not look_like a person_who should be go into a gun shop
-PRON- want to look as normal as -PRON- could without wear a disguise
collapsible batons be illegal for civilian to carry so forget about that

the police do_not want to spray -PRON- though -PRON- volunteer to instruct -PRON- friend how to administer the spray most effectively first -PRON- friend give -PRON- a little taste face eye and mouth right_away
-PRON- could tell -PRON- be not go to deter much_less stop -PRON-
-PRON- police buddy instruct -PRON- friend to unload the entire can on -PRON-
unfortunately the crowd get more_than -PRON- expect outdoor demo with a little wind
-PRON- be hard for -PRON- to keep -PRON- eye open -PRON- be painful though -PRON- demonstrate that -PRON- could still run_around and talk and be not noticeably hinder by the pain and irritation of the intense burn sensation from the spray

dear mirage -PRON- be with great sadness that -PRON- write this
-PRON- have love -PRON- for many_year
-PRON- always choose -PRON- over the other
-PRON- be special
from -PRON- tropical decor and aromatherapy- to the tiger habitat
-PRON- even have -PRON- wedding reception with -PRON-
well -PRON- be be a few_year
and -PRON- be shocked and disappointed at what -PRON- have become
-PRON- could almost say that -PRON- be close to sleazy
yes -PRON- know that -PRON- be try to stay hip with -PRON- new art deco room with orange accessory that could trigger a migraine
sure -PRON- be probably hard to control the odor of cigarette and beer in the casino
but-
somehow -PRON- use to do -PRON-
the wynne do -PRON- as do bellagio venetian pallazzo and many_other
but what -PRON- really find distasteful be the new revolutions club where anyone walk past- on the way to the elevator-
be give a show of half naked go go dancer
-PRON- know -PRON- be not a prude
there be some woman that enjoy go to a strip club with -PRON- man
and -PRON- say -PRON- go girl
that be -PRON- choice
but -PRON- be not one of those woman
-PRON- do_not like anything push in -PRON- face
and -PRON- do mean push in -PRON- face
the dancer be in little arched doorway between the casino and the club
-PRON- know -PRON- be vegas but -PRON- expect a little more class from -PRON- mirage
good bye forever
be korean and read about the kogi truck on serious eats a couple of year_ago -PRON- be pretty excited to hear that vegas have -PRON- own place that serve korean fusion taco
but -PRON- excitement quickly turn_into disappointment
taco -PRON- be $ 3.00 each but be $_5.00 for two include_tax so -PRON- buy a beef taco and a pork taco just to sample
both taco come in a small flour tortilla dress with kimchi which resemble sauerkraut and be pretty bland lettuce and cilantro
-PRON- be difficult to differentiate the two meat -PRON- taste pretty_much the same and be overly_sweet with a hint_of spiciness but really lack any depth of flavor
-PRON- also feel that there be too_much of the kimchi\/lettuce and not enough meat
overall the owner be friendly and the food be fresh and cook up quickly so that be where the 2_star be come from
but unfortunately -PRON- be not impressed_with the taco as -PRON- feel there be nothing remotely korean about -PRON-
food be amazing and -PRON- be a good thing b\/c the hostess kind_of suck
-PRON- 45_minute wait take almost 2_hour and the snotty high schooler work the hostess stand almost catch a piece_of -PRON- mind
but thankfully the food and service make up for -PRON-
-PRON- would say go earlier or later to avoid some of the rush especially as the bar_area get jam pack
-PRON- be a picky_eater especially when -PRON- come to ramen
-PRON- standard be monta on eastern
-PRON- hear this_place be good and decide to give -PRON- a try on -PRON- lunch break one day
-PRON- sit_at the bar and the service be very fast
the server be kind_enough to give suggestion and answer_any_question -PRON- have
-PRON- try the spicy chicken ramen and add corn
-PRON- be absolutely_delicious and now jinya be -PRON- favorite raman place in_town
-PRON- be a_bit of a trek from -PRON- house but totally_worth -PRON-
this restaurant be good
the bleu cheese potato chip be super good and about the only_thing -PRON- go there for
the service can be spotty when -PRON- be there depend_on the day especially in the bar_area
-PRON- be a nice place to drop in for something small
a nice restaurant for an upscale date_night or dinner with friend
-PRON- make_reservation for saturday evening and check in at the counter on the casino level
-PRON- be lead to the elevator and up to the very top of mandalay_bay
the vibe up top be very unique and be best explain by look_at photo
to begin -PRON- order a glass of merlot and -PRON- husband order a cucumber chill
-PRON- be surprised to find that there be many reasonably_price wine by the glass to_choose_from on the menu
the cucumber cocktail be delicious and refreshing
-PRON- be also bring a bread basket with a couple of type_of bread include pretzel
alongside be hummus oil and butter
the foundation room salad for -PRON- and caesar_salad for -PRON- husband

-PRON- husband enjoy -PRON- caesar as_well
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- center cut filet very much
-PRON- be well_season and juicy
the pomme puree side be creamy with a lovely butter flavor
-PRON- husband order pan seared diver scallops and really do_not enjoy this dish
-PRON- think the scallop be a_bit rubbery and generally not the good scallop -PRON- be have
the finale for the meal be the highlight for -PRON-
-PRON- husband pretend to be healthy with a generous serving of fresh berries
-PRON- enjoy the calvados apple bread_pudding and wish -PRON- have save more room
this be one of the most delicious dessert -PRON- have have in awhile
the bread_pudding be delicious but the walnut caramel sauce put the decadence over the top
-PRON- waitress be very_friendly and warm
-PRON- make -PRON- feel very welcome and the amount_of time -PRON- check in on -PRON- be just right
the man assist -PRON- be on_top_of fill water and clearing plate as necessary
-PRON- definitely meet -PRON- service expectation for a nice restaurant
overall the restaurant lend -PRON- to a nice plate for a date_night or peaceful meal with friend
check_out the lounge down the hall after dinner for one of the good view of the strip
-PRON- totally dig this_place
unlike all the other spot on mill diverti be not crampp loud or try too hard
the service be great genuinly friendly concern
very lay_back for a couple beer cheap pool or sandwich
-PRON- friend love -PRON- sandwich say -PRON- be all -PRON- would hop for
-PRON- think mine coulda be big be
a lil let down that there be no brown mustard or pickle
but -PRON- love the place completely recommend -PRON- to anyone
not really for clubbin meetin bitch but great for a_few cold one
parking be the ramp behind jack in the crack there be a patio to smoke at
that be away_from some of the main sidewalk crowd(which be nice too
-PRON- have 75cent pool $_2 red stipe well price pitcher karakoe a sweet drummer outside some nights(i think friday beer pong on request
-PRON- wish -PRON- have one or 2 more pool_table
n -PRON- need a shelf or some stool by the exist one for drink n to put -PRON- crap on
diverti be great -PRON- hope -PRON- can make -PRON- last where -PRON- be at
btw -PRON- do_not think that one kid have any idea what capicola be
there be no fattier chewier meat on the planet
-PRON- think -PRON- mean turkey
wicked lil bite
wicked_spoon be the buffet locate on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan hotel casino in_las_vegas nv
-PRON- be worth review because -PRON- be a lil different_than -PRON- typical vegas buffet
this buffet present all of -PRON- dish tapas style
rather_than scoop -PRON- desire portion of food out of a large common serve tray there be pre_make mini portion individual piece and small_plate dish for -PRON- to select
for_example there be lil wire mesh basket that contain 2 small piece_of fry_chicken mini ramekin of baked macaroni cheese tiny box of chinese pork fry_rice pre_make mini assorted salad etc
a+ on wicked food presentation portion control
there be also an omelette station where -PRON- can get a custom omelette make to -PRON- precise liking
yes -PRON- offer egg_white
-PRON- have an egg_white omelette make -PRON- highly_recommend -PRON-
-PRON- fave part of wicked_spoon be the dessert station
there be ton_of tiny pastry macaroon muffin cookie a mini molten chocolate lava cake in a mini pan too_many more to mention
oh yea the most wicked part of this buffet be the in house gelato parlor complete with a guy behind the bar scoop -PRON- out
there be a wicked amount_of yummy flavor a wicked line
-PRON- serve the gelato as a mini scoop in a mini ramekin but -PRON- can get as many flavor as -PRON- want
-PRON- faf be the mint chocolate_chip thai_tea wicked good
also -PRON- recommend get one of those lil mini molten chocolate lava cake to make -PRON- diet fail complete
-PRON- be glad -PRON- only get mini scoop
or -PRON- would have be in trouble
the dessert station be definitely the icing on the cake steal the show as there be something to satiate everyone 's sweet_tooth 5 + gem
the ambience at wicked_spoon be more sophisticated sleeker than the bellagio_buffet
-PRON- also adore the cute mini presentation of all the different food 5 gem
-PRON- first lap around the buffet -PRON- be overwhelmed think where do -PRON- begin
-PRON- then fall_into a state of buffet confusion
everything look great at first but then upon close inspection -PRON- could_not find hardly anything -PRON- actually want a very real 1st world prob
also there be no fresh fruit boo
so the pre plat minis end_up not be -PRON- cup
o'tea
cuz -PRON- like to ration out -PRON- own portion or mix match create -PRON- own plate
control freak ugh maybe
in the end -PRON- do_not eat that much real food since -PRON- do_not want most of the pre_make cute lil portion control tapas and -PRON- do_not eat fry_chicken or pork fry_rice regardless of how adorable -PRON- look
but do_not stress -PRON- be not go to starve from lack of great food here
this set_up be just not -PRON- preferred method of buffeting but -PRON- may be -PRON- so check -PRON- out
on an economical note wicked_spoon be cheap_than the bellagio_buffet at around $_30 for breakfast brunch as_oppose to $_40 small_portion = small price
in conclusion if -PRON- wanna go on a wicked dessert binge -PRON- will_definitely buffet here just for the gelato dessert bar which be why -PRON- be give wicked_spoon a solid 4 gem
-PRON- do like the cosmo concept of pretty lil plate but if -PRON- be go to buffet -PRON- wanna pig out -PRON- wanna go old_school bellagio breakfast brunch buffet where there be no hold bar king_crab leg no little bite allow
tue night steel be one of the most fun thing i have ever do at a shooting range

note -PRON- use groupon and end_up purchase more_than -PRON- think -PRON- would just because -PRON- like the photo so_much
be sure to double_check the location
if\/when -PRON- do make -PRON- appointment
this_place be amazing perfect for a girl 's night intimate date or to bring_out of towner

everything be small shareable and mean to be eat with -PRON- hand
-PRON- come with a_few girlfriend and share too_many delicious thing the highlight be the korean fried_chicken steak tartare hundred of yelper do_not lie and the pork steamed bun
-PRON- also have an_awesome cheese board serve with blueberry vanilla jam and candy nut
damn -PRON- be so good
as_far as drink -PRON- never stray from the manhattans which -PRON- would argue be the good in_toronto

-PRON- like -PRON- a lot and -PRON- love the coffee
first_time be here the price be reasonable but the quality be below_average
-PRON- order the medium sushi maki and sashimi boat the sashimi especially the sweet shrimp do_not taste fresh
the uni be like water and the only one taste alright be salmon
for the sushi -PRON- do_not understand_why -PRON- put wasabi in the middle_of the rice without tell the customer beside that
the rice be hard as stone and no vinegar taste feel_like -PRON- be eat overnight rice along_with wasabi
the quality of sushi be ridiculous compare to the sashimi the texture of the sushi be bad
feel_like -PRON- be eat a piece_of rubber
overall
-PRON- probably will not comeback anymore if -PRON- be look for cheap sushi without the quality -PRON- may be a fit for -PRON-
but -PRON- rather pay more to get a decent fresh quality sushi to -PRON-
nice place to have a cool drink on a hot day

will try again but not anytime_soon
this_place be great
-PRON- go here to have -PRON- car_wash and vacuum so -PRON- could install a car seat in preparation for -PRON- baby -PRON- be expect in the next few day
there be ton_of dog hair in -PRON- car as -PRON- have a german shepherd
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- probably could_not get all of the hair out by just vacuum and -PRON- believe -PRON-
there be ton
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would probably have to get -PRON- detailed which be pretty pricey
and -PRON- could_not imagine spend that much on just clean -PRON- car
after express -PRON- concern and tell -PRON- -PRON- could_not spend that much with a baby on the way -PRON- work out a great deal for -PRON-
-PRON- do_not have time for the detail that day
so -PRON- give -PRON- a free ultimate wash and -PRON- go_back the next_day and get an_amazing detail
-PRON- car look and still look fantastic
on_top_of the fact everyone be so nice from the man who sell -PRON- the package to the guy_who clean the car to the man inside the gas_station where -PRON- pay -PRON- also have compassion for -PRON- need and be more_than willing_to_help -PRON- out
ps- even on just the express drive_through wash
-PRON- be greet at the end by someone_who hand dry -PRON- vehicle
-PRON- do -PRON- right here
-PRON- would come_back just for the complimentary garlic_knot at the start of -PRON- meal
-PRON- be huge fluffy buttery garlicky piece_of heaven that definitely fill -PRON- up because -PRON- eat 2 whoop
penne vodka be a solid choice and have a sweet vodka sauce top with prosciutto chicken alfredo be decent
not the good -PRON- have ever have as the sauce be a little thin but the flavor be delicious and rich caprese salad come with a generous_portion of mozarella and -PRON- be wonderfully creamy in the middle tomato be just ok
make_sure to add balsamic vinegar as -PRON- do_not come with any and -PRON- vinegar be divine
hefty price but at_least -PRON- come with generous_portion of pasta -PRON- add chicken to each of -PRON- pasta dish which be an_additional $_6 and the chicken make the pasta a_bit soggy and water_down
-PRON- would have be nice if the chicken be slice into strip instead_of come_out as a whole breast -PRON- lunch be $ 90 and -PRON- do_not even order any alcohol pretty steep but -PRON- be vegas
service be just ok
start out good as -PRON- rush to take -PRON- order
but then -PRON- have to flag -PRON- down for box and the check
-PRON- definitely hit the spot for -PRON- pasta craving but -PRON- be not blow_away_by the pasta
-PRON- may come_back on -PRON- next vegas trip to try -PRON- meatball since that seem to be -PRON- specialty
-PRON- have be go here for over 5_year but -PRON- can_not imagine ever go_back
a little background go on a friday_night for drink and dinner
there be no game go on so -PRON- be not busy and there be plenty_of open table
beer_selection be great although -PRON- do_not_know_how to pour a guinness 4 inch of head
food have always be decent
service be deplorable
take 15_minute for waitress to come to -PRON- table with no beer menu or food menu in hand and -PRON- only know a_few of the beer -PRON- have on_tap
from the time -PRON- sit_down to receive two beer -PRON- be 35_minute
waitress be oblivious and unapologetic to the situation
management seem to be non_existent
decide to leave and go elsewhere to eat drink and spend -PRON- money
-PRON- have such big expectation for this_place
-PRON- have be want to go since -PRON- open and -PRON- be soooooooo disappointed
service be good -PRON- be clean
average price blah blah
but the food be so ughhh
nothing_special at all to be honest
-PRON- do_not even like -PRON- food
-PRON- get the carpaccio to start -PRON- boyfriend get a soup
and for -PRON- main -PRON- get the chicken club and -PRON- boyfriend get the fettuccine bolognaise
-PRON- be so brutal
neither of -PRON- finish -PRON- meal
the pasta have these super crispy breadcrumb which taste_like seed or something
not a fan
and -PRON- sandwich have the weird taste ever
-PRON- will_never go_back
update go to pai instead
the original owner and chef of khao san road open up -PRON- late thai_restaurant call pai on duncan and -PRON- be awesome
-PRON- green_curry in coconut bowl be delicious
as for khao san road -PRON- expectation be very high due_to the number_of review and the four_star rating perhaps that be -PRON- problem
the food be too_sweet and the dish -PRON- have be meh
nothing to write_home_about
-PRON- have have good pad_thai and definitely better curry elsewhere
overrated the new owner and chef of this_place have bring the quality of the place down several star
horrible customer\/patient service admin staff review
-PRON- be not the only patient be tell -PRON- need to have bring x_ray or would need additional x_ray the day of the appointment
seem_like -PRON- be not in tune with the patient need
in this day and age the patient be try to stay within what insurance cover
long_story_short 1
the girl at the desk be more in tune with eat -PRON- breakfast vs greet patient no greeting be give
2
dr moxley 's office do_not coordinate well with the dentist to insure x_ray be send over prior to -PRON- daughter bust and -PRON- ask -PRON- what -PRON- need to bring with -PRON- the day of -PRON- appointment
-PRON- have to drive over to pick_up film the day of the appointment yet after get back -PRON- be not the pano x_ray that -PRON- need
so -PRON- drive over from moxley to the dentist back to the moxley for no reason
poor communication between dentist office and oral surgeon
-PRON- ask what -PRON- daughter need for -PRON- appointment -PRON- say -PRON- have everything
-PRON- arrive to the appointment and the oral surgeon need the film
-PRON- drive to get film when -PRON- get back to oral surgeon the dentist do_not take film of what -PRON- need -PRON- have to take new film anyways
so in a nut shell -PRON- appointment be late -PRON- be send to pick_up x_ray from the dentist that do_not even greet -PRON- when -PRON- walk_in
-PRON- be too_busy eat at the counter only to return to the oral surgeon dr moxley for -PRON- to tell -PRON- the dentist do_not take what -PRON- need and now a pano need to be do by this time -PRON- be 10:45
-PRON- daughter appointment be at 10 a.m.
this could have be avoid by good communication between the dentist and the oral surgeon office on behalf of a mutual client\/customer\/patient
also the level of customer_service behavior be below_average and not_sure if this be the standard in the health industry but eat in front of customer not greet -PRON- have personal conversation should be avoid or keep at a low tone so the client do_not over hear -PRON-
more focus_on prepare the admin side of the appointment would provide a good experience and referral from -PRON- patient
-PRON- will be call -PRON- insurance to also provide feedback
-PRON- be disappointed with this harvey 's location
be here three_time
-PRON- staff be friendly
-PRON- find the quality of the food not to be as good as other location
-PRON- big beef be the cleanliness of this_place
every_time -PRON- have be here almost all the empty table be dirty and garbage be all over the floor
will not be back to this_location
this wendy_'s always
and -PRON- mean always have the bad service
currently be in the drive_thru for 15_min
-PRON- would not even be here if chipotle have not run out of cheese
excellent family run business
there be no place in arizona where will -PRON- find tamale like these
good masa that -PRON- have ever have in a restaurant
truly handmade tamale
-PRON- have try -PRON- all and none disappoint
if -PRON- need a quantity for a special event order a day or two early
ahhhh where to begin
-PRON- must_say lola maybe -PRON- most favorite restaurant in northeast ohio
every_time -PRON- have din here -PRON- be an_absolute pleasure
and -PRON- leave very happy
on this occasion -PRON- husband
and -PRON- celebrate -PRON- one yr
anniversary
so -PRON- decide to splurge a little on a bottle_of wine
-PRON- share a bottle_of orin swift papillon avable at heinens
-PRON- be amazing -PRON- new_favorite
-PRON- have beef cheek pierogis and bone_marrow for appetizer
the pierogis be ridiculous serve with a mushroom brown sauce and a little horseradish crème fraiche yummmm
the bone_marrow -PRON- would not order again
-PRON- be very good
but -PRON- be super heavy oily and greasy
-PRON- basically take the marrow out of the bone and then fry -PRON-
-PRON- be serve with bacon jam pickle red_onion crème fraiche salt and cilantro -PRON- be very good do_not get -PRON- wrong
-PRON- be just too_much
-PRON- prefer standard bone_marrow spread -PRON- on bread like butter
for -PRON- main -PRON- have the lobster thermidor and -PRON- mate have the smoked pork chops
-PRON- guy
seriously
-PRON- be amazing
the lobster be cook to perfection and be not as heavy in a sauce as expect
-PRON- be fabulous
-PRON- husband be also very very good -PRON- be so tender and the polenta be so warm and buttery
for dessert -PRON- server give -PRON- complimentary mini cupcake and a piece_of chocolate
-PRON- have such a beautiful time -PRON- service be great no guilt in this dinner
war einmal fuer ein spaet feierabend bier da
nettes personal und schöne lokation
preise fuer die lage i
o.
fun place lot_of thing to do
bowling movie 's
-PRON- never stay there so no comment in that area
this_place be a staple absolutely great customer_service and food
david the owner be super_nice too
-PRON- be from california and boba shop there be off the chain
unfortunately the one in az do_not compare as much
the close one -PRON- have come_across be boba tea house
the staff be pretty friendly and -PRON- get a good amount_of traffic from the cool kid that come through here which be right up in -PRON- alley because -PRON- be kinda young
and -PRON- be a pretty chill place to meet new people
-PRON- bring -PRON- friend here once
and -PRON- just watch sport -PRON- have a lot_of tvs with different sport
on
so -PRON- do_not have to miss a game if two be go on
the good
-PRON- drink be pretty_much just like california
-PRON- be really dig -PRON- fresh stuff like jackfruit and avocado smoothie
the red_bean snow -PRON- save for -PRON- cheat day
if people do_not_know -PRON- be really good and now -PRON- know hahaha
-PRON- be a big tea fan and -PRON- tea can be a_bit strong
-PRON- thai_tea which be something -PRON- will grade a boba shop of be a delight
-PRON- ask -PRON- about -PRON- and -PRON- brew -PRON- thai_tea for at_least 6_hour
-PRON- believe -PRON- because the lollicup i work at in california lollicup stockton off march lane do the same
the bad
-PRON- be not too critical but -PRON- think the place could use more light
that be a preference to -PRON- though
-PRON- be attract to the warm color wall -PRON- have but at night -PRON- seem to have a couple 's atmosphere
-PRON- advice keep -PRON- up
-PRON- will be drop by soon for more boba
-PRON- favorite thai_tea with boba honey black tea raspberry snow with assorted jelly and -PRON- holy grail red_bean slush with red_bean at the bottom
really can_not beat the price
about 8 buck for all -PRON- can eat with hibachi
food be decent and refill often
the hibachi have a good selection of meat
chicken pork beef shrimp squid and scallop
none_of the other buffet hibachi grill offer scallop
so that be pretty_good
there may be a short wait during weekday lunch
highly_recommend this buffet
o'noir like many_people say be a restaurant that people go for that different experience
pros great for a date_night
-PRON- hire blind people ironically -PRON- can navigate around this restaurant better_than -PRON- can
the location be amazing-
-PRON- be in the heart of toronto
make -PRON- realize how valuable and important -PRON- sense of vision be
con -PRON- have time dinner which mean that -PRON- serve people specifically at time a b or c.
if -PRON- can_not make that time well tough love
-PRON- be rather pricey when -PRON- be limit to a prix_fixe three course meal
-PRON- would_recommend check_out the menu online prior to -PRON- reservation p.s
-PRON- need reservation
without a doubt o'noir do_not need to advertise to get the word out there
-PRON- be a great novelty place to go on a date
people go for the hype for that one time experience
if -PRON- have not be -PRON- seriously recommend that -PRON- give -PRON- a try
today -PRON- have the coffee and pecan cinnamon_roll -PRON- be great good place for roll great service good find
this_place be amazing
and never disappointing -PRON- eyebrow always come_out beautiful and the price be perfect
this will always be -PRON- spot
for the long_time this have be one of those show -PRON- have always want to see but never find the chance to
finally got -PRON-
and the verdict great show but some minor disappointment
the theater be great costume music decor but those extra line -PRON- add in
-PRON- like if -PRON- be go to take like 90 of -PRON- dialogue from the movie try to stick to -PRON-
but occasionally -PRON- will add some tid bit that do_not apply or just throw -PRON- off
sorry -PRON- be sensitive when -PRON- come to lion king no shame in admit that be -PRON- favorite all time disney movie and -PRON- ok when -PRON- add random banter and modernized language but add 2 or 3 word to a dialogue that be away_from the movie script be unacceptable
on a nice note at_least the musical do_not show sex in the star when simba be grow_up and look for the ghost of -PRON- father
be ready to wait for -PRON- food
-PRON- cook everything from_scratch
that say everything be gigantic and amazing
-PRON- have be to hash house a go go several_time with family and friend in_vegas and -PRON- never_fail to a.
take a long_time
b. be absolutely_amazing and worth the wait
highlight include all of -PRON- burger massive omelet and fry_chicken and waffel
i hear there be a new location on south strip
but i ve only ever go to the one on west sahara
good thing to do on the way to or from red rock
this farmer 's market may not have have a lot_of produce but -PRON- do have some nice art craft as_well_as some wonderful homemade item
there be bread loaf try the pumpkin spice -PRON- be quite good as_well_as a nice array of dry fruit and a glass blower that have some beer bottle that -PRON- twist into cool shape
not a bunch_of fruit veggie but a decent amount go for the other stuff as_well and -PRON- will not be dissapoint
-PRON- hate go to the dmv to the point that -PRON- would never do more_than complain_about the prospect
like anyone_else -PRON- would think
this one be the antithesis of every other dmv experience -PRON- have ever have
there be maybe ten people actually there for service and at_least ten people actually work despite -PRON- be around 130pm when -PRON- would except people to all be at lunch
-PRON- get -PRON- business do and back into -PRON- car in a total of 18 minute
-PRON- think that be a veritable record
at_least in -PRON- experience
totally go_back to this one when -PRON- get stick go to the dmv again
guess_what california_roll be not real japanese food
neither be sushi pizza or dragon roll
chicken or beef teriyaki be also not actually japanese authentic teriyaki be for broil fish
what be very authentic japanese be the menu the decor the drink list the cook and the waitress at ematei
-PRON- be by_far the most japanese place -PRON- have find in_toronto and -PRON- opinion be reinforce by the number_of expat who eat_here regularly
in_fact -PRON- help to speak some japanese if -PRON- be order at ematei since the wait staff be very much esl
have spend most night of the week in an izakaya pub during -PRON- stint in japan -PRON- be really miss the small dish of comfort_food and the homey atmosphere that do_not get reproduce in_toronto 's japanese inspire restaurant
some of -PRON- favourite ematei izakaya dish aspara bacon asparagus wrap in bacon yesss butter scallop mushroom foil buta kimchi
okay that be korean
zaru soba kabocha tempura and yakitori
-PRON- do_not recommend the kani foil since -PRON- be not real crab
the unagi chahan -PRON- call -PRON- charan for some_reason be great
something awesome for winter be that -PRON- can reserve one of the tatami room for a nabe party which be the japanese version_of a hot_pot party
note
-PRON- have not have the sushi at ematei
when there be a thousand other place for sushi in this city -PRON- like to order thing that be less ubiquitous
bonus do -PRON- know_what ematei mean
an ema be a small wooden wish plaque that can be purchase at shinto shrine
tei mean shop so ematei be shop for prayer plaque
many a memorable albeit fuzzily so night at this bar when -PRON- be in pgh knock on door for the obama campaign
-PRON- be convinced
hoss 's be sort_of the walmart of steakhouse but -PRON- like -PRON-
if -PRON- can get over the drabby decor -PRON- can really like this_place
-PRON- like to pig out at -PRON- salad\/soup\/dessert bar
-PRON- steak be tasty even when compare to steak at expensive restaurant and -PRON- waitress be always friendly
as_soon_as -PRON- pull into the parking_lot -PRON- know -PRON- dinner be go to be delicious
wonderful smell waft out- tomato garlic italian spice mmmmm
-PRON- have drive_past this_place for year be too intimate to go inside
this be a mistake
-PRON- try the garlic and parsley hand cut pasta the recommend garlic and rosemary be out pair with the ammmaazzz pomodoro sauce- highly_recommend
-PRON- have just the right_amount_of zing
the next_time -PRON- have to bring a side or dish for a party
-PRON- can_not wait to grab -PRON- prepared mac and cheese and other tasty treat
if -PRON- be willing_to pay a_bit_more for local and fresh then this be the place to score -PRON- next dinner
-PRON- will be reward
ps- parking can be tricky do_not even try for the space in the front head straight for the parking_lot in the back
-PRON- be definitely a fan_of prairie girl
all the cupcake frosting be delicious
-PRON- have a variety_of option but -PRON- fave be definitely the peanut_butter and carrot_cake
-PRON- a tiny shop so when -PRON- be busy be be pack
the design -PRON- do for the cake and cupcake be very sweet and have nice presentation
-PRON- also like how -PRON- can grab snack sized cupcake for a taster or quick grab and go which be a very nice_touch

lastly -PRON- share an order of wor wonton_soup that be fill to the brim of the bowl with everything -PRON- would expect
arvand the bartender\/server have a personality and customer_service as unique as -PRON- name

-PRON- also present -PRON- with many option as to sauce and side
-PRON- really know_how treat customer

ron from absolute appliance services be just awesome
-PRON- dryer be sound_like a truck be go_through -PRON- living room
and -PRON- use yelp for the 1st time to locate an honest and knowledgeable repair service
after_read the review -PRON- call ron and -PRON- be here within the hour
the news be not good and -PRON- dryer could be repair but ron be honest enough to tell -PRON- that after labor and part -PRON- would be good off get a new dryer
-PRON- also point out that because of the age if the dryer -PRON- more_than likely would need more repair in the future
-PRON- really_appreciate -PRON- honesty because -PRON- could have very easily just stick -PRON- to -PRON- do this repair know full well that -PRON- would be the start of many more to follow
-PRON- also waive the service call fee because of the need for a new dryer which by the way be very_reasonable
sear want $_80 just to come and diagnose the problem
-PRON- have already tell all -PRON- family and friend about -PRON- excellent service and would_recommend absolute appliance services for any appliance repair
thank -PRON-
ron and -PRON- do get a new more energy efficient good dryer for less_than what the repair would have be
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give this taco_bell 0_star
line wrap around the building but not move
inside cashier at the front be rude and slow
-PRON- visor be cover in cat hair
-PRON- do_not even look up
quick to tell -PRON- not ready to swipe after not say a word to -PRON- other_than -PRON- order
food be good but the service and that cashier make this a 1_star review at best
-PRON- have be to many indian buffet and this be by_far the good -PRON- have be to in_las_vegas
great selection of both meat and vegetarian curry
-PRON- love that -PRON- have goat curry and kabob
the biryani be a little spicy for -PRON- -PRON- wish -PRON- have another selection of biryani that be less spicy
-PRON- refill very often so that the batch be always fresh
get the garlic naan -PRON- be very_tasty always come_out warm and fresh
the sauce be also on point -PRON- could eat -PRON- everyday
love the pakora and samosas -PRON- always start with those item as appetizer
the price be amazing and the staff be always so attentive
the place be big enough that -PRON- do_not have to wait to get seat
food be phenomenon
-PRON- go to the opera house grill for lunch all the time
the food be always fresh and delicious as_well_as portion very generously
the staff be all very sweet and happy to see -PRON- which make -PRON- feel awesome
-PRON- never find -PRON- wait an unreasonable amount_of time for -PRON- take out to be ready which be super important as -PRON- be usually on break from work and in a rush
-PRON- be also a_bit of a picky_eater and -PRON- have never mess -PRON- order up at all
the only_thing -PRON- would caution people on be -PRON- have a_bit of a small menu
-PRON- be very greek influence which be great but -PRON- do limit the variety_of meal available
also most main do_not include a side which -PRON- find a_bit strange
other_than_that amazing
the chicken_finger be the good
this be an_old school gem in downtown
remind -PRON- of the mob day of vegas because -PRON- would never think this_place that be downstairs in old downtown would cater to -PRON- like a 5_star strip restaurant
hugo 's cellar be absolutely_delicious start_off with the house salad be fantastic and then the entree
-PRON- ha lobster stuff with crab
so good
-PRON- love how -PRON- roll around with after dinner liqueur as_well
contacted sugarlips cakery base_on online review
-PRON- work with -PRON- to custom design a cake for -PRON- husband 's 40th birthday_celebration
-PRON- order -PRON- just a week before the event
-PRON- perfectly execute -PRON- vision for -PRON- cake and -PRON- think the price be well_worth -PRON- though -PRON- be list on other_review as be less expensive so if -PRON- find price online be sure to check on the price when -PRON- call so -PRON- be not take by surpise
oh and most_importantly -PRON- be delicious

the chicken and rice be full of taste
the only_thing spicy on the plate be the cold slaw

-PRON- have recommend dr. shields to several friend and co_worker and none_of -PRON- be disappoint
-PRON- can_not recommend -PRON- strongly enough for great dental care from some very_nice people
the restaurant be very small at first -PRON- be not_sure -PRON- be in the right place
-PRON- be run by a community kitchen staff
the server\/host be very_nice and attentive
service be very good
the food be very delicious
fresh_ingredient and well_prepared but portion be very very small
main dish average of $_14 do_not come with a side $_6 so -PRON- order the brisket and tongue dip with seasonal veggie

instead_of send -PRON- away -PRON- fit -PRON- in
-PRON- really_appreciate that since -PRON- live clear across_town
the drive be totally_worth -PRON-
-PRON- be the good
what can -PRON- say
-PRON- be really impressed_by -PRON- business
last_week -PRON- get two regular sub
when -PRON- get home -PRON- notice that -PRON- seem to be lack in meat and the cheese be non_existent on one and paper thin on the other
the sub be still good but -PRON- be disappointing and -PRON- send -PRON- concern off to jersey mike 's
within a couple of hour the manager of the location -PRON- have this experience call -PRON-
-PRON- offer to treat -PRON- family to a sub dinner for -PRON- trouble
that be obvious commitment to quality service
the sub be fantastic this time
turn_out -PRON- be actually have issue with the slicer the day -PRON- go
-PRON- will get -PRON- business again -PRON- sub be tasty with quality ingredient and -PRON- be commit to customer_service
yes -PRON- price be a_bit high then a place like subway but -PRON- do get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- always come_here for tint tire etc
-PRON- always give -PRON- the good price
and -PRON- be not just say that -PRON- definitely check online to compare
if -PRON- want -PRON- do right this be the place to go
-PRON- have have a hard time find a carpet cleaner that -PRON- like and -PRON- have finally find -PRON-
very_impressed_with -PRON- work
-PRON- should have take before and after pic
-PRON- have dog and a 1 year_old so -PRON- carpet be very worn
-PRON- look and feel brand_new
pat be very_friendly and clearly take_pride_in -PRON- work
-PRON- also offer $_20 off for 3 can of food that -PRON- donate
-PRON- be a great deal and for a good because
-PRON- be recommend to -PRON- and for a good reason
very_impressed
the restaurant look nice but the food be incredibly meh
the rib be anything but fall_off the bone very tough and rubbery
and -PRON- wife 's side_dish be stale clearly leftover from a prior era
-PRON- dad get a pull_pork_sandwich that one at_least rate at 3_star
still overall -PRON- do_not quite get all the high_rating
totally disappointed with this bakery\/yogurt cafe
-PRON- be a huge cupcake conioisseur
-PRON- love to hear of small business open in the area -PRON- could_not wait to visit
-PRON- first take a look_at -PRON- website to see what flavor -PRON- have
-PRON- find a really good one -PRON- think
pumpkin if -PRON- remember -PRON- say chocolate_chip in -PRON-
the website be a little confusing on what flavor -PRON- have
anywho -PRON- go in ask for that pumpkin cupcake an be tell -PRON- do_not have that one -PRON- be have problem change -PRON- website and that_s the story -PRON- get lol
the place be not decorate cute like most bakery -PRON- order 2 cupcake a cake ball and inquire about the pupcake of which -PRON- think three dog bakery own the name pupcake
-PRON- buy a red_velvet which be tasteless how do -PRON- make a tasteless cupcake
the icing be just sugar an butter
-PRON- be like no flavoring be add to the batter or icing
the cake ball first on -PRON- website -PRON- say first to produce -PRON- in the carolina 's wrong -PRON- freind -PRON- be not
someone do_not do -PRON- tour d cupcake before open -PRON- own bakery that_s a shame
again -PRON- find the same problem with the cake ball no taste at all
the pupcake be horrible look -PRON- be red color
an -PRON- ask what be in -PRON-
the main ingredient that shock -PRON- be agave syrup -PRON- a good sweetner for vegan and gluten_free diet not diabetic 's or dog
-PRON- actually just high fructose corn syrup when break_down
-PRON- ask if the pupcake have sugar in -PRON- the lady help -PRON- say no
agave syrup be a sugar and if cranberry juice be -PRON- than yes -PRON- have sugar
not to mention -PRON- be look doughnut shape but without the hole_in the middle and a nasty mini milk bone shove in the top gross
-PRON- take -PRON- home to inspect -PRON- more -PRON- smell sweeter than the cupcake lol
-PRON- taste -PRON- and seem_like -PRON- could have be cranberry juice ughh
do -PRON- a favor for a great cupcake go to cupcrazed sas or blushing
for -PRON- dog take -PRON- to canine cafe no salt or sugar in -PRON- treat or harmful dye
-PRON- use pedal dust pretty_cool stuff
well another bakery cross off -PRON- list on to the next
how do this bakery get vote good in_charlotte
make_sure -PRON- do what -PRON- say -PRON- be go to do and do the job right the right the first_time
watch -PRON- perform the service or -PRON- will skip treatment step
when -PRON- call in -PRON- transfer -PRON- to jody eastman who have zero customer_service_skill as -PRON- be rude condescend and continually cut -PRON- off speak over -PRON- when -PRON- company clearly drop the ball
-PRON- have be warn do_not use this branch of terminix
everyone_else from terminix be good but jody ruin the entire experience ensure -PRON- will_never get -PRON- or -PRON- family 's business again
by_far the good experience -PRON- have have with ac unit reparation
-PRON- have be a loyal_customer for about more_than four year and every_time -PRON- be readily available
a completely honest person that always tell -PRON- the truth about the problem and give -PRON- option for the solution
-PRON- highly_recommend mr. freon 's service to everyone
do_not wait to make the mistake of go_somewhere where -PRON- be not honest
this_place be exactly_what -PRON- have hop -PRON- would be large fast and delicious
-PRON- have to feed a large sport team after a day run_around outside
this_place be more_than large enough for everyone and the staff handle the onslaught of 25 people with ease
the place be large enough that -PRON- do_not seem to bother anyone and the burger be awesome
the only_reason -PRON- be give the place 4_star instead_of 5 be that -PRON- do_not love the sweet_potato tot
-PRON- be kind_of soggy
but the regular fry and sweet_potato_fry be great
be look for new sushi place pro con
1 food be reasonably_price and portion large 2 sushi be good tasting 3 service be lack
-PRON- gear service on how long -PRON- water_glass be leave unfilled
-PRON- be never fill for the entire evening
-PRON- also ask to do a take out order the waiter say -PRON- be ready

con
oasis water park be very expensive and -PRON- can only bring in water
also for adult -PRON- can_not have -PRON- adult beverage in the water which if pay 11 dollar for -PRON- drink -PRON- should be able_to chill in the water with -PRON- on a 108 degree day

largely unaware of the prevalence of the muslim religion in china let_alone -PRON- particular contribution to the country 's culinary diversity -PRON- be with great curiosity that five friend
and -PRON- sit_down amidst the colorful confine of dumpl king and with friendly service pair to one of the most cleanly space on spring mountain road the dozen plate that follow be every bit as surprising as the relative lack of praise the space have receive since open -PRON- door nearly one year_ago
truly a decorative space with red floral cover each seat and several shin ornament arrange in the foyer as_well_as alongside the bar -PRON- be at one of the large turnstile table that the group be sit and with full view afford of each dumpl be make by hand suffice -PRON- to say that the surprisingly low price menu be an even big bargain when take into account the painstaking effort involve in each piece a single order of ten broth soak beef soup dumpling take the team of three nearly five_minute to mix roll out fill and twist fourteen time before arrange to steam
treat to tea as_well_as water that unfortunately require frequent prompt to be refill -PRON- be in a pair of item consider to be northern chinese specialty that the tasting begin and with tender potato slice like noodle beneath a drizzle of vinegar present alongside richly spice lamb mix with shoot onion and pepper the open volley traverse the palate adeptly the light heat of dry pepper occasionally peak through with a touch of unexpected sweetness linger on the end
move onward to the dumpling -PRON- be largely at the discretion of -PRON- server that the table place -PRON- faith and opt to see what could be do in a variety_of filling and style one would be hard press to say which presentation be good as not a single one lack the steamed beef xlb more meaty than_most with an intensely flavorful broth while both the stone dumpling amidst -PRON- golden lattice and the rich venison variant be chockablock full of flavor the later almost as juicy as the soup dumpling with more_than_enough aromatic nuance to help even the most timid palate conquer -PRON- fear of game
personally impress by the soft pumpkin fry beneath salty egg yolk while other feel the flavor too mundane -PRON- be again a vegetarian special that wow in the next round of plate and although the robust heat be an_early challenge to -PRON- somewhat timid tongue subsequent bite of the laoganma eggplant prove more and more accessible a mild numbing effect perhaps contribute to somewhat off put oily flavor prevalent in sizzle leek pancake that be otherwise lightly fry and creamy beneath the exterior crunch
admittedly take a chance on peking duck consider the heritage of the space in which -PRON- din suffice -PRON- to say that neither tepid flesh nor flaccid skin be well receive yet with eye at this point glaze over from the sheer volume of delicious food -PRON- be the final plate of the afternoon that prove the most interesting of all a pile of chop taro boil soft beneath a shatter lacquer of caramelized sugar that necessitate a quick bath in iced water in order to avoid severe burn each cube harken a creamy one bite crème brûlée
undoubtedly unique not only in -PRON- heritage but also with regard to the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff dumpl king be perhaps the very definition of hidden_gem the dumpling -PRON- undoubtedly on_par with the good in the city while other unique plate such_as the potato eggplant pumpkin and taro be the sort_of thing -PRON- have not see since trip to toronto and richmond bc

so -PRON- get the yakitori chicken
-PRON- have taste many_other place chicken
and -PRON- would say the taste be not the good but worth the price
hawaiian poki trio be what bring -PRON- to enoodles and when -PRON- receive by plate -PRON- be amazed at how fancy -PRON- try to make a simple dish
poki should be keep simple and cut into cubed sized bit
however -PRON- shred the sashimi into tiny piece small than the tomato piece in the poki
the taste be no be near the flavor -PRON- would get from_hawaii
the shredded tuna mixed with the flavor of the ingredient -PRON- would not recommend this dish
especially for the price pay
-PRON- main_course be a simple yaki ramen with pork
-PRON- be a very simple guy and enjoy fried raman
this be why -PRON- order this dish
the raman mix with the amount_of pork be awesome and the flavor of the overall dish -PRON- enjoy
for $_8 -PRON- really_enjoy this dish and would_recommend -PRON- to anyone_who enjoy a simple cheap dish that will not hurt -PRON- wallet if -PRON- be disappointed

but when -PRON- happen again -PRON- call loe 's appliance and speak with the owner directly
-PRON- make a appointment for the next_day and although -PRON- be run a_bit late -PRON- keep in touch with -PRON- the whole time
so -PRON- know_what be go on
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- seem totally professional and not one of those talker that go on and on
-PRON- get right to business and solve the problem quickly and the price be way less_than what -PRON- think -PRON- would be completely satisfied
-PRON- come_here after all of the amazing review -PRON- see here on_yelp
-PRON- be here mid feb 2012

-PRON- ask -PRON- to be extremely spicy because -PRON- love spice
-PRON- do_not make -PRON- as spicy as -PRON- want -PRON- to be but -PRON- do_not_care
-PRON- taste amazing
-PRON- make -PRON- to -PRON- taste if -PRON- ask -PRON- too
-PRON- be like a home cook meal basically

the staff have_no_idea how to charge with a giftcard
-PRON- apparently get a new system the other day but lc corporation fail to communicate and train -PRON- staff
-PRON- be hand -PRON- pizza while -PRON- still talk_about how to make the giftcard work
-PRON- call someone to ask and be suppose to get a call back
-PRON- do_not tell the person on the other side of the call that -PRON- have someone wait because -PRON- never call back while -PRON- be wait
-PRON- wait as -PRON- still grip about the new system
one of the guy eventually say hey how be -PRON- go to help this lady -PRON- have be stand here and wait
and the lady say -PRON- be wait on the call back
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could just get money in exchange for the giftcard and pay with that -PRON- be not willing_to do that
okay well do something instead_of just griping
-PRON- eventually ask for -PRON- card back give -PRON- -PRON- pizza back and walk_out
-PRON- do_not get how -PRON- even let something like that happen
should have just allow -PRON- to take the pizza and be on -PRON- way while -PRON- figure_out -PRON- screw_up with the new system
anyone want a giftcard
-PRON- will not be back
wow
-PRON- will_never visit this_location again the employee be prepare food with bare hand
-PRON- be wipe -PRON- forehead of sweat and then touch food absolutely disgusting

--fresh --lot of choice
--service bad
--skimpy
-PRON- be hungry an_hour later
--price
$ 85 for 4 before drink or tip
overall -PRON- like the food but -PRON- be a poor value
go and feel good about -PRON- choice of eclectic healthy veggie and tofu just know that -PRON- be expensive and -PRON- will be eat again very soon
really_cool atrium area to hang_out in
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- smoothie though -PRON- be pretty pricey
however -PRON- snag a slice of pie out of the dessert case and omg so good
-PRON- be suppose to be raw key lime pie
but -PRON- taste more like cheesecake
delicious though at $_6 a slice -PRON- will have to be a weekend treat rather_than a regular pit stop
twenty four
hour
poutine
need -PRON- say more
la banquise be know to be rowdy which be why -PRON- make_sense that there be two bouncer station out front when -PRON- go
-PRON- be a group_of 6 and -PRON- just take a few_minute to be seat inside there be also a backyard
among -PRON- -PRON- order the classique the bacon and the smoked meat
smoke_meat be probably -PRON- favorite but -PRON- be all equal part artery clog and delicious
perfect drunk food as evidence by the full table everywhere
beware
the portion be pretty large even if -PRON- get the small dish
so bring a friend or 5
-PRON- also offer fry and gravy as a side because why the hell not
also try one of the beer a microbrasserie alchimiste ipa which be one of the bad attempt of beer -PRON- have ever try
seriously avoid at all cost
other_than_that la banquise be a great time
when i first hear of this_place i be a little disturbed by the name but once i get the nerve to go inside i be impressed
-PRON- have yummy pancake
-PRON- be diabetic friendly and -PRON- offer sugar free maple syrup
-PRON- do_not see many cracker around but -PRON- do offer soup so -PRON- may have -PRON- in the back
-PRON- also have a store area where -PRON- sell interesting knick knack and other strange item
-PRON- would_recommend this_place
at hokkaido seafood buffet -PRON- have the bad fry spring_roll -PRON- have ever have and the bad pan fry dumpl too
the rest_of the food that -PRON- try be not that much good
-PRON- all become unappetizing after a couple bite or just one bite with the exception of the stir_fry green_bean but even with those at one point -PRON- bite_into something hard and unbean like like a grain of sand
by the time -PRON- get back home
-PRON- be hungry
aside_from the food and have to look around for the white_rice there be not anything_else -PRON- can complain_about
service be good

remone take amazing care of -PRON- love -PRON-
despite -PRON- nicely decorate corner that attract -PRON- in with a great view and lighting the service can be by_far the bad i have see in the q complex
the server would just ignore -PRON- and purposely delay serve -PRON- as i observe from what_happen to -PRON- party and two other table
never see staff hold grudge or do as -PRON- please
what a shame for such a nice place
this_place be great
love the way -PRON- can customize -PRON- meal
-PRON- get the spicy pork meatball with the meat sauce and cheese tortellini
the buffalo shrimp crab_dip do_not taste_like shrimp or crab just cold buffalo sauce and cream_cheese which be not bad just unexpected
but the donut ball for dessert be warm and delicious
this be a lovely garden design by yoyo ma on the south side of queens quay
most tourist do_not wander further west than the harbourfront centre or hto park so this_place be usually nice and quiet even in the summer
there be lot_of private little intimate nook
in the summer -PRON- have weekly concert thursday_night and sunday_afternoon weather permit
-PRON- be a mix of mostly chamber music and world music sometimes accompany by dancer
last_year -PRON- have taiko drummer
the garden be locate right_across the street from the walter carsen centre for the national ballet so -PRON- will see a lot_of dancer pass_by
if -PRON- want to grab a coffee smoothie or a sandwich the music garden cafe http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/music garden cafe toronto be a perfect option

-PRON- have be year since -PRON- last stay_at the hard_rock
-PRON- be in_town for the first weekend of march madness
the hard_rock offer -PRON- a couple of comp night and discount rate for the third night which be too good to resist for -PRON- tues fri stay
-PRON- have request a non smoking room with a king bed
unfortunately by the time -PRON- get to the hard_rock the only non smoke room available have two queen bed which really be not a problem
-PRON- be put in a standard casino tower room on the 4th floor overlook the pool
obvious to -PRON- the casino tower room have be renovate since -PRON- last stay
-PRON- room be clean modern and comfortable
-PRON- like the new look
fortunately unchanged over the year -PRON- bed and pillow provide excellent support and a great night 's sleep
the hard_rock 's bed have always be a strength
the shower have good water pressure
of note though hot water be never a problem in the morning hour but -PRON- seem to be somewhat in short supply never cold but merely warm in the early evening hour
outside noise be not a problem this trip since -PRON- be there midweek and the pool do_not appear to be open but casino tower room face the pool be definitely in the blast zone of noise from the weekend 's rehab pool party
gambling at the hard_rock be a huge_disappointment
all blackjack table except for those in the high limit room $_100 minimum be 6:5 no surrender game which be a surprise give -PRON- off strip location and -PRON- be in effect even during the daytime hour and midweek
the hard_rock do have multiple table with low limit i.e. $_10 and $_15 but even $_25 table be at 6:5 bj payout
the hard_rock 's sport_book while not a great place to watch the game be not nearly as busy as sport_book on the strip especially_during march madness
-PRON- do_not compare bet line between the various sport_book but -PRON- be surprisingly quick and easy placing bet at the hard_rock sport_book
the hard_rock will always hold a special place in -PRON- heart
-PRON- remain a good place to for a midweek stay
-PRON- will_continue to avoid -PRON- like the plague on the weekend
-PRON- dining_option have only get strong over the year
however -PRON- simply can_not recommend -PRON- as a place to gamble
4_star for -PRON- room and dining_option
2_star for gambling
have a late_night dinner with a family of 6
dinner be excellent and the staff be very_nice and friendly
would certainly recommend_this_place
-PRON- can_not bring -PRON- to give this_place less_than 5 stars-
-PRON- be hand_down the good buffet -PRON- have ever be to
quite literally everything -PRON- eat be absolutely_delicious and despite be full -PRON- go up for more
the option be endless and -PRON- can sample so_many different_type_of food
the game changer for -PRON- be the crab_leg that -PRON- cut in half for you-
-PRON- hear that right no work crab_leg
-PRON- will be dream about those crab_leg until -PRON- next_visit
mmm mmmm mmmm
-PRON- be very eager for violette 's vegan to open ever since about year_ago -PRON- see a sign on a storefront near the intersection of tropicana decatur say -PRON- be come soon
when -PRON- finally do come to fruition at a different location -PRON- have to check -PRON- out
since then -PRON- have be three_time once each for breakfast lunch and dinner
-PRON- first_visit be for dinner
-PRON- friend and -PRON- share a order of nachos
-PRON- be good although -PRON- do_not_care for the sour_cream as -PRON- do_not really taste_like anything
-PRON- order the texas hold em quesadilla which -PRON- like and -PRON- friend order a stew make out of tofu seitan and tempeh
-PRON- say that -PRON- be good but do_not_care for the side or kale as -PRON- be not flavorful
-PRON- try add some salt but the grinder at the table just leave chunk of salt so -PRON- could_not eat -PRON-
for dessert -PRON- have the chocolate_cake and -PRON- have apple pie
neither one of -PRON- be impressed_with the dessert
-PRON- check on line to see what time -PRON- open for lunch and arrange -PRON- errand around the 11:00 time
when -PRON- arrive a piece_of paper have handwritten hour tap over the sign on the window say lunch start at 11:30
-PRON- ask the server and -PRON- say -PRON- do_not start serve lunch until 11:30
-PRON- tell -PRON- that online
-PRON- say 11:00 -PRON- just smile in a snarky manner if -PRON- ask -PRON- and reply 11:30
-PRON- be just tell -PRON- so -PRON- know as a lot_of people check on line before come to a place
-PRON- return later and order the bbq seitan sandwich with a side or cole_slaw
after about 20_minute the server inform -PRON- -PRON- be all out of cole_slaw
-PRON- be the first person there for lunch so -PRON- seem -PRON- do_not have any as_oppose to have run out
the sandwich taste good but the seitan be very tough
like -PRON- could_not bite through -PRON- when -PRON- try to take a bite of the sandwich and -PRON- fall out each_time
-PRON- last_visit be for breakfast
-PRON- arrive at 9:00 and sit_outside as -PRON- still have the closed sign_up and table and chair be spread out as -PRON- clean
at one point an_employee come outside on -PRON- cell_phone say the place be a mess and quickly go inside when -PRON- see -PRON-
after about_10_minute -PRON- peak -PRON- head inside and ask if -PRON- would be open soon
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be open the closed sign be still up
-PRON- order the scramble tofu sausage and cheese on an english_muffin
as -PRON- wait -PRON- continue to clean
the overwhelming smell of bleach from the mop bucket be a_bit too_much at time
twenty_minute later -PRON- be the only customer all of this time a blt arrive
-PRON- call over the server and ask -PRON- if -PRON- be a blt and -PRON- reply um -PRON- look_like -PRON-
-PRON- reminder -PRON- -PRON- do_not order a blt
and -PRON- say what -PRON- d order
so -PRON- do_not check -PRON- before bring -PRON- out
-PRON- do stop backtrack
o apologize and ask if -PRON- want a muffin
another 20_minute go by and -PRON- correct order come_out
the food be good but not remarkable
-PRON- give a three_star rating because -PRON- over all opinion of the place be okay
the food be alright nothing_spectacular
the server be okay with the exception of -PRON- lunch time experience -PRON- be nice enough but not_overly friendly or attentive even
every visit -PRON- have see other customer have issue with something be out or not serve at this time as_well
-PRON- would really like to see -PRON- iron out the issue and be successful
-PRON- be great to have an all vegan place that serve organic food too
-PRON- always make a stop here when -PRON- be pass_through madison
-PRON- chocolate be out of sight
especially -PRON- specialty flavor and homemade marshmallow
-PRON- can_not wait to visit madison again

could_not have be good
though -PRON- be a brief visit -PRON- be in love with the decor
if -PRON- love vintage this be where -PRON- need to stop
-PRON- will_definitely prepare to a long stay in the future
oh and that sexy car outside the building be too gorgeous

this_place be filthy dirty gross
crap all over the table grease on the floor
employee seem nonplussed and -PRON- probably would too if -PRON- be only make $ 7.80 an_hour
-PRON- chicken be soggy and the butter burger taste_like -PRON- have see good day
yuck
salad be good but that be about -PRON-
would have be good off and save a bunch_of money get a rotisserie chicken and a bag of frozen veggie from harris teeter
the mixed vegetable be nothing but a swanson medley of pea carrot and corn drench in salt and butter
please take -PRON- off the menu -PRON- be just embarrassing
come_here for a late lunch once
food
order 1_lb
honey_garlic original wing with sweet_potato_fry be able_to substitute from regular fry
the sweet_potato_fry be thin cut crispy and season well
the dill sauce be a tasty companion to both the fry and wing
overall yummy service atmosphere
not_sure if -PRON- be due_to low peak hour but the waitress be attentive and regularly check up on -PRON-
pricing there be daily_special on the menu which be worth come_here for
pricing of wing be fair for location
damn take out that second mortgage before catch a game here
1_star be even a stretch
-PRON- buddy be in_town padre fan and want to watch -PRON- play at a different stadium other_than -PRON- home field on 83rd in peoria
-PRON- have never be down here to this stadium so -PRON- decide that -PRON- would try to catch a game here
the padres be play the giants at 7_p.m. on friday_night
-PRON- go online to buy ticket and almost pass out from shock
lawn seat be $ 39.00
yes -PRON- hear that right
a lawn seat aka general admission be $ 39.00
-PRON- know -PRON- be in scottsdale but jesus christ
-PRON- be a spring training game for cry out loud
when -PRON- see those price there be no way in hell -PRON- be go to pay that much to watch a spring game
-PRON- buddy wind up get some ticket through a reward program at work
so technically -PRON- do_not cost -PRON- anything out of pocket
-PRON- get -PRON- some bleacher seat
just for shit and giggle -PRON- look up the price of bleacher seat
$70.00
once_again be -PRON- fuck serious
$ 70.00 to sit on a metal bench down the 3rd base line
-PRON- pretty_much throw up in -PRON- mouth
anyways
enough of that
with ticket in hand -PRON- head on down to scottsdale
-PRON- find free_parking a_few block down the only positive thing -PRON- can say about this trip and make -PRON- way up to the stadium
-PRON- like the spot -PRON- situate in but once -PRON- walk_through the gate -PRON- do_not have anything_else positive to say
here be -PRON- beef 1
bleacher seating-
-PRON- be 100 foot long row of bleacher
one way in one way out
if -PRON- be seat on the end not near the walkway have fun shuffle past about 40 people to get to -PRON- seat
2
standing room only-
-PRON- have a huge hill where -PRON- can stand in the outfield to try and watch the game
-PRON- the small and bad area -PRON- have ever see for sro
unless -PRON- get there way early find a piece_of land to stake -PRON- claim near the actual fence good_luck enjoying try to watch the game from any decent angle
the other problem circle back to those bleacher seat
the bleacher be all up and down 1st and 3rd base so while walk_around the stadium there be no sight line
-PRON- be a horrible set_up
3
concessions-
-PRON- understand that thing be expensive at the stadium
-PRON- have no_problem shell out a_few buck for certain thing
-PRON- see some of the price of thing and once_again throw up in -PRON- mouth
a beer be $ 11.50
an -PRON- -PRON- ice_cream sandwich great thing ever btw be $_7.50
damn gina
-PRON- -PRON- be really really good and -PRON- be -PRON- favorite ice_cream sandwich ever but not $_7.50 good
4
bathrooms-
-PRON- go into 2 different restroom and each one have only one urinal and 2 stall
-PRON- know this be an_old stadium but with only 3 pissing receptacle available line be incredibly long just to take a leak
5
the giants_fan in_general
-PRON- have many friend that be giants_fan and none_of -PRON- be douchebag so
-PRON- know that all giants_fan be not complete tool
besides the direct people -PRON- know though most giants_fan -PRON- have encounter be dick
-PRON- just have an aura about -PRON- that -PRON- do_not like
very smug
-PRON- the same_thing -PRON- have experience up at att
beautiful stadium but -PRON- be surround_by asshat
thankfully -PRON- find some sd folk to chill with for a_few innings and have a good time
northern ca folk be just different
-PRON- much prefer the more lay_back chill vibe from southern ca and get along better with people from southern ca la and sd
well that be about -PRON-
-PRON- do_not ever see -PRON- come_back to this stadium
-PRON- be way_too expensive sight line be the bad -PRON- have ever see at a ballpark and the general douchebaggery of giants_fan will keep -PRON- away
kelly sargent have be cut -PRON- hair for about 20_year along_with -PRON- 2 daughter
when -PRON- hair start to grey -PRON- highlight -PRON- hair and people have_no_idea that -PRON- have grey hair

this_place have get pretty bad over the year -PRON- remember come_here and the food be decent
-PRON- order a curry rice and seriously
-PRON- can serve this to -PRON- customer
the rice be so mushy the curry have no taste the chicken seem_like -PRON- be cook overnight
the plate be $_7 which -PRON- find be quite pricey for the size and the taste
-PRON- will not come_back here
horrible food
-PRON- can_not think of a single negative thing_about this_place
the food the drink the service the ambiance all perfect in the cool way
-PRON- start with a frozen mango margarita with a spicy syrup on_top
-PRON- be a beautiful color and the sweet mango mingle beautifully with the heat of the syrup
the chip be serve warm and come with a fresh salsa
the guacamole be pile high in the bowl and be chunky and fresh with a generous_amount of cilantro
-PRON- have a veggie burrito which have a variety_of roasted vegetable and spanish rice
-PRON- love that -PRON- could taste a slight char on the vegetable
-PRON- lunch companion have a trio of taco which include barbacoa and a shrimp_taco that have marinate onion on_top
-PRON- be not_sure what the third taco be because -PRON- be too_busy fall in love with -PRON- burrito
-PRON- server be friendly and one of -PRON- show -PRON- the colorful local artwork that adorn the wall as_well_as the art studio where local artist bring -PRON- artwork play ping pong and hang_out in this unique and delicious phoenix cantina
paz cantina be recommend to -PRON- by a bellman at the sheridan in downtown_phoenix
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could suggest a place for mexican_food that be not touristy
mission accomplish
whether -PRON- live_in_phoenix or just pass_through check paz out
really
do -PRON-
the food be awsome the meatball be world class
the chicken franchasise be amazing
the bread be true italian nice soft middle with a crust every thing_about the food be amazing the service a little_slow server have to many table and -PRON- a game with seat -PRON- leave open table so that as guest walk by -PRON- think there not on a wait
then -PRON- make u make 15 20.minute which ever one wait because -PRON- can_not walk anywhere_else
randy 's smile face and upbeat attitude be really what make this_place which be why -PRON- be receive three_star instead_of one or two
the hot_dog be ok definitely good_than say circle k.
the burger seem to be make with cheap pre form frozen patty and be not very palatable
also -PRON- do_not have french_fry like a normal burger joint -PRON- have home fry
not the same
if -PRON- be get a burger -PRON- have better come with fry
just sayin
the sandwich be on the small side for the price and be again just ok
be sure to have lot_of time on hand because everything be make to order and take a while or order ahead
-PRON- want to support this_place really -PRON- do
but unless -PRON- want a free hug from randy -PRON- would be good off go_somewhere_else
-PRON- want to like this_place but -PRON- just can_not
the service be slow from start to finish
-PRON- be after 9_p.m. so -PRON- be not_overly busy
a table should never have to be sit with a credit_card in hand star into space for 10_minute_before anyone notice -PRON- be ready to leave
the food be mediocre
the coconut shrimp be all breading and soggy
the fried cod be tasteless
the fancy drink be completely water_down
-PRON- leave a table full of food and $_75 at this_place
-PRON- will not be back
just a burger nothing gourmet out -PRON- because -PRON- be no where to be find
decide -PRON- want a burger and try -PRON-
-PRON- could_not even cook -PRON- to order
order 2 burger fry milk shake and beer for $ 47 not worth -PRON-
friday_night and this_place be busy
parking be in a small lot but if that be full -PRON- can park across the street or down the block behind this old auto shop bldg
no good time to visit this great diner
-PRON- bring friend_who have never be to pinky 's before
-PRON- do_not think -PRON- have even hear of -PRON- even think -PRON- have live in the area for 15_year
-PRON- order the sweet_potato chip with wasabi dip pimpin cheese fry with chili and fry_pickle
light and delicious breading on the pickle be so nicely season and the crispy of the sweet_potato chip be not greasy at all
sweet_tea be delicious
then on to -PRON- dinner
-PRON- order pterodactyl burger one ding dong style and the other westside style
cook to perfection make of ultra fresh beef
topping be amazing and in the right proportion to the huge burger
-PRON- other dinner companion order the pork burger with arugula and pineapple
-PRON- have the most amazing flavor explosion on -PRON- tongue when -PRON- beg a bite
-PRON- be too full for dessert but take home a piece_of pound cake lemon drop style
yes like the soda
-PRON- also have cheerwine flavor cake
just like homemade
as -PRON- can see -PRON- really do_not like this_place
totally kid
-PRON- adore -PRON-
and -PRON- will be back
as for the staff -PRON- work together like a clock
everyone there be wil to fill -PRON- glass or answer -PRON- need from the hostess to the cook
that be what make this_place the total package
-PRON- be from out of town
find this nail_salon and have a great experience
andy do a mani and a hot stone pedi
very_thorough and professional job
-PRON- find out that -PRON- need to get a shuttle to -PRON- hotel a_few mile away and say lee who be work the desk would drive -PRON-
-PRON- be awesome and -PRON- can_not wait to go_back next month
great daily deal on drink
love -PRON- grill swordfish taco
service be timely and pleasant
will return
feel adventurous -PRON- hubby and -PRON- stop_by for brunch as -PRON- have not try this eatery before
-PRON- be seat_right_away and almost_every table be fill
the first_impression for -PRON- be that -PRON- smell heavily of grease
the menu be large something for every taste
-PRON- server be pleasant and attentive
-PRON- take 30_minute for -PRON- food to arrive
-PRON- both order pancake with combo deal of 2 egg and bacon
the pancake be huge so a short stack of 2 cake be more_than_enough for -PRON-
-PRON- order be correct but -PRON- hubby 's cranberry orange cake arrive with blueberry instead_of cranberry
-PRON- over medium egg be more like over easy pretty loose
along_with the cake and egg -PRON- have one iced_tea and a coffee and by the time -PRON- add a tip -PRON- have a $_40 breakfast
note for the handicapped there be not even one ada compliant parking space here
there be however a curb cut out by the door
doubt -PRON- will go_back especially after_read some of the other_review here
-PRON- be originally from the pittsburgh area but move out of state a couple of year_ago
-PRON- be come home to get marry and look to yelp for a salon with great review
-PRON- be so_glad -PRON- find this_place
everyone be so friendly
the salon -PRON- feel nice and cozy
but most_importantly -PRON- make -PRON- wedding party and -PRON- look gorgeous
whitney do_an_amazing job on -PRON- hair and molly have -PRON- make up look flawless
all night at the wedding everyone tell -PRON- -PRON- look_like a porcelain doll
even -PRON- moh who work in a hair_salon be very_impressed by the work do here
-PRON- highly_recommend this salon to anyone get marry
-PRON- will not have to stress because -PRON- be in great hand
-PRON- shashimi be great and fresh
the price be reasonable
-PRON- order the chirashi_bowl and the house sushi
-PRON- be both amazing
$ 55 include_tax in total
not a bad deal
this be -PRON- late yelp_review where -PRON- be truly stuck between 3_4 star and wish -PRON- could go half like the overall average do
so -PRON- 3 1\/2_star experience here feature a high_level of customer_service even_though -PRON- be very obvious that the female employee actually take -PRON- order be a new employee
another employee look over -PRON- shoulder to make_sure -PRON- enter the detail of -PRON- order properly and that particular employee answer every question -PRON- have with enthusiasm for -PRON- business
the teriyaki charburger be a good choice especially_since -PRON- leave off the mayo because -PRON- do_not_know_why anyone would want to mix mayonnaise with teriyaki sauce
unless -PRON- be mustard and ketchup make no sense for -PRON- to mix condiment sauce on any sandwich
pick one for that particular flavor and enjoy -PRON- do_not create condiment chaos that overwhelm the ingredient
that teriyaki burger be good_than -PRON- hop and a really good value for the price
feel free to take -PRON- lead and order -PRON- also with sourdough instead_of the toast bun for no upcharge
-PRON- also have a garden salad with tri tip steak add to -PRON- and while -PRON- also think -PRON- be a good value
-PRON- have to agree with other that the salad be just kind_of average in taste and nothing_special
the value come in the size of the salad and the amount_of steak -PRON- add for the additional charge but -PRON- do_not even finish the salad portion despite try three_different dressing at a time to add some flavor to the veggie
this space be very clean and convenient for those like -PRON- who stay just off the strip and sometimes just want to grab and go dinner from a place a step up from fast_food yet not wait at a bar for takeout at a casual dining restaurant
besides after a long flight into vegas and all the additional time require to get off the plane pick_up -PRON- golf club at baggage claim ride the shuttle to the rental_car center pick_up the actual rental_car -PRON- and drive to -PRON- hotel this habit be right on the way to westgate and feed -PRON- quickly without_any hassle of the strip -PRON-
really want to like this_place
great review great pic
i even go on -PRON- instagram and be so_excited when i see past client pic
but 1 -PRON- be bit rough on -PRON- nail
-PRON- get a pedicure and gel_manicure and as one girl be do a pedicure another girl be try to do a manicure and nick -PRON- a couple time when -PRON- be cut -PRON- cuticle 2 i show -PRON- a picture from -PRON- actual instagram page and -PRON- recommend something_else because -PRON- be not_sure of the color
note
i really do like what -PRON- end_up do but still
3 after a week -PRON- nail be crack lift and chip -PRON- look_like i be at 2_3 week mark which be usual for -PRON-
see pic
maybe be just an off day for -PRON- but ehh be not too impressed_with everything
-PRON- be still try to pay -PRON- bill at the cleveland clinic
-PRON- call the payment department many_time each month and actually speak to a rep maybe 1 out of every 20 time -PRON- call
-PRON- have be able_to successfully complete 2 out of -PRON- 3 installment but this last one have be really hard to get through
-PRON- have even give -PRON- -PRON- payment information twice in order to complete this last payment the first_time the money never come_out of -PRON- acct and the second_time -PRON- call the rep say the computer crash in the middle_of -PRON- transaction
-PRON- guess -PRON- just do_not want -PRON- to finish pay off -PRON- bill
-PRON- must really like the sound of -PRON- voice
so -PRON- have begin pay this bill off in monthly installment last march
and -PRON- have be try to make this last payment for about two month
ugh
-PRON- would think -PRON- would be more receptive to take the money -PRON- owe -PRON-
-PRON- be not expensive $ 75\/night
-PRON- have stay_here before and be satisfied
the room be small enough to give -PRON- a cozy feel
especially the bathroom
the breakfast be pretty_good for what -PRON- pay for
the only issue that -PRON- have be the a\/c and the bathroom
the a\/c be in a position that do_not allow the air to hit the rest_of the room
-PRON- end_up have to move a table to get the airflow go
a room that -PRON- rent in the past have the air hit a mattress that be inch away and do_not allow for proper circulation
as the door the bathroom the shower drain extremely slow and the bathroom vent move air even slower
-PRON- have to have the bathroom light\/fan run non stop to keep air move at the sink and the bathroom or -PRON- get humid
the pool be very clean and blue
not like the picture -PRON- see from another yelper
yes the carpet have see good day but the two time -PRON- have stay_here
-PRON- be fine
this_place be a joke
-PRON- have be wait 3_week for an_appointment
-PRON- have call countless time and get a never end ringer
when someone do answer -PRON- be tell the lady_who handle referral would call -PRON- back within the hour
this have happen 3 time now and not once have -PRON- be call back
if -PRON- be suffer from severe depression anxiety and ptsd -PRON- can_not keep wait and wait
-PRON- need help now
some friend and -PRON- come on a saturday_night at 5 and stay till 8
there be very few patron which be too_bad because this_place have a lot to offer decent organic food a nice view of the lake live jazz music start at 7
unfortunately with little advertising or visibility -PRON- worry_about -PRON- future success
while -PRON- generally recommend captain 's cove -PRON- must warn against order the world 's healthiest dessert feature the xocai chocolate the restaurant hawk
-PRON- consist_of a medium sized chocolate cookie a scoop of vanilla ice_cream and a square of the chocolate -PRON-
the cookie be gritty and have a horrible flavor and this dessert will set -PRON- back $_14 the same as most of the entree on the menu
yikes
do -PRON- a favor and order one of the cheesecake which be quite nice and reasonably_price
what a gorgeous and classy place without the stuffy\/snooty feel
-PRON- stop in for saturday brunch and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- get the classic tartine with side salad and eat every bit of -PRON-
-PRON- friend order the sundae waffle yes ice_cream and chocolate sauce on a waffle and -PRON- too be fantastic
-PRON- also have a beautifully decorate area in the back where -PRON- host cooking class and that spot can be use for party especially in the warm weather where the wall can open to the patio

first_off let -PRON- say that -PRON- be glad this_place exist in bloomfield as the only other passable alternative to umi and that -PRON- will update this review after -PRON- have experience -PRON- again
place be comfortable and small for a sushi place
-PRON- come_here with a friend_who be not very experienced
so -PRON- decide to order roll rather_than straight fish however -PRON- do get an order of otoro which be silghtly steep at $_18 for two slice
rolls be great the spicy_tuna be actually spicy which be a refreshing change
the otoro be not as buttery as -PRON- expect and the temperature of the fish be distracting-
-PRON- be way_too cold in the center and cool near the edge
when temperature be so important for just two piece_of fish like this -PRON- would have expect -PRON- to be perfect
service be great up until the end of the meal
-PRON- be thorough in explain the menu
-PRON- have order something that -PRON- suggest one of the more expensive box roll at the bottom of the menu but -PRON- come_out as a square of rice with a thin sliver of yellowtail on_top
neither -PRON- buddy nor -PRON- be particularly fond of yellowtail especially on a huge hunking wad of rice so -PRON- let -PRON- know
-PRON- proceed to suggest that -PRON- take the fish off and just eat everything_else which -PRON- be floor by
do
-PRON- just tell -PRON- to eat rice ball
-PRON- do_not eat any of -PRON- and get no compensation back
all thing consider this_place be passable but -PRON- will be back for the omakase which be offer in 3 tier

-PRON- have search high and low for a place that serve this and -PRON- be so_glad -PRON- find cc
in case -PRON- be wonder_what -PRON- be -PRON- be when the raw marinate meat be cook over a slow flame with half cook rice
-PRON- be chicken biryani and bihari kabab be also great
-PRON- would_highly_recommend this_place for anyone wish to sample a taste of hyderabad 's royal cuisine- just make_sure -PRON- call_ahead and order for pickup to avoid
long_wait time
the yard be like a big recess for adult at night
so -PRON- seem
so weird to see three restaurant in one place
do -PRON- work do -PRON- not work
well -PRON- be pack even_though one can_not find easy_parking
obviously when place the the yard and the other restaurant in one place fox do_not think about logistic
so what if -PRON- have to walk_in the middle_of the night in the dark people will still come
and -PRON- do
-PRON- have a large_group and even_though a reservation be make day before -PRON- be not very accommodate in the end
drinks be overprice even for a soda and cider
service well -PRON- feel for the girl who have to run_around quickly to all the table and group
-PRON- try the pretzel dish -PRON- have have good
-PRON- be pretty hard and the cheese be not really the great
-PRON- end_up not eat there because again -PRON- area do_not have enough seating nor table to do so
others say -PRON- be not impressed_with -PRON- food either
the ping pong area be fun however a group_of pretentious hipster decide to stand right in back of -PRON- so a lot_of the ball would hit one of -PRON- obviously
do -PRON- try to move or say sorry
yeah no
sound_like recess back in the day
would -PRON- go again maybe for a drink
but -PRON- would not wait any amount_of time to get a table for any of the restaurant when there be other place right down the street just as popular and able_to seat -PRON- right within a decent amount_of time 45_minute to an_hour
be way to long
-PRON- stay_at this resort
only_downside if -PRON- consider -PRON- a downside -PRON- be about 10miles from the strip
-PRON- enjoy not have the noise of the strip but still be within drive distance
room be spacious
bathroom be awesome
the resort have a casino which pay out well and 4 5 restaurant onsite
-PRON- be at 2 jayde fusion ok and burgers and brews pretty_good
-PRON- offer a ca resident rate when -PRON- call in and the price could_not be beat
service at the front_desk and from room service be great
good place to stay off the strip
oh_yeah and the pool
best in_vegas
-PRON- want a second opinion on an inspection -PRON- receive on -PRON- car and joe do an_awesome job and explain_everything to -PRON- thoroughly

bad drive_through experience will avoid this_place at all cost
rude and unprofessional worker food be eh and fry be cold
-PRON- be not a fan_of run to write a review of salon until -PRON- trust -PRON- implicitly
-PRON- have be burn before
-PRON- however choose to throw that caution to the wind and say that this be one of the good salon -PRON- have ever be to

-PRON- wish -PRON- have a shake shack back in hawaii but until then -PRON- get -PRON- fill in_vegas
located right outside of the new_york new_york -PRON- hard not to miss
although -PRON- have only go both time around 8_p.m. there be always a line however -PRON- never a long_wait to order
both time -PRON- get the shack stake and both time there be amazing
try to get the fry mushroom on the side but -PRON- do_not sell -PRON- sad
-PRON- have try a_few of -PRON- shake and be not too impressed_with -PRON-
the strawberry be decent
the same as everywhere else so nothing -PRON- would go out of -PRON- way for
-PRON- also try -PRON- salt peanut_butter shake and that be just a mistake
so salty
-PRON- know -PRON- salt but -PRON- be as if someone be mad and decide to get back at the customer by load up the salt content
other_than_that the wait time be an average of 10_15_minute for the food
service be great
the place be keep clean even_though -PRON- be so busy
-PRON- love be able_to sit_outside with all the beautiful light in the background
-PRON- come_here because -PRON- have an on_site window chip repair guy
-PRON- husband have recently come_here and receive excellent service
and then -PRON- get a chip
so -PRON- need a quick fix
that be a reasonable_price for service and very_friendly customer_service
richard help -PRON- out and be very polite kind and courteous
after -PRON- leave richard call -PRON- because -PRON- think -PRON- leave -PRON- backpack there
honesty
-PRON- good policy
-PRON- would go_back to -PRON- for sure
-PRON- be a low price car_wash kind_of gal
so this be pricey for -PRON-
-PRON- like the $_5 gas_station wash
-PRON- get the $ 14.95 regular wash and -PRON- be great
-PRON- car be extensively vacuumed and the window be all smudge free
great service
a rip_off staff be not friendly food and drink overpriced golf overrate
and room be small
ok so this_place be a big box dental corporation
this be not -PRON- average individually owned\/family own dental practice
-PRON- first appointment -PRON- be tell over the phone that -PRON- schedule two visit one to clean -PRON- tooth and one for the x rays\/consultation
-PRON- would never hear of that and think -PRON- be odd and inconvenient but agree to go
oddly -PRON- do all of -PRON- in the first appointment so -PRON- be not_sure_why -PRON- be initially tell this
the dental hygienist start_off by tell -PRON- that because -PRON- be 2_month past due for -PRON- last 6_month clean that -PRON- probably have some form of gum disease\/periodontal disease and -PRON- need to prepare -PRON- for that
this be before -PRON- would take one look in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- then pull out a book fill with picture of people with advanced gum and periodontal disease and make -PRON- look_at each picture
by this time -PRON- be wonder_what kind_of dental office -PRON- be in because none have ever do this
and -PRON- know full well -PRON- have healthy gum
-PRON- then take about 40 picture of -PRON- tooth
-PRON- normally have bite wing do and every 5_year -PRON- will do the full mouth x_ray but -PRON- have never have actual camera type picture take
-PRON- take a good hour
finally -PRON- start the exam and unbelievably -PRON- have no gum disease nor periodontal disease
in_fact the dentist when -PRON- finally appear say -PRON- have excellent gum and bone which -PRON- already know
the same hygienist then start use high pressured sale technique to get -PRON- to buy one of -PRON- electric toothbrush
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- like the one -PRON- have
and -PRON- make snide comment
like,"well
if do_not want the good etc
-PRON- then inform -PRON- -PRON- would be charge_$ 80 for this visit
-PRON- have never be charge for a 6_month cleaning\/exam
-PRON- have insurance and -PRON- be free
-PRON- say -PRON- would be charge_$ 56 for an oral cancer screening and $ 24 for fluoride
-PRON- decline both and that be when -PRON- get nasty
-PRON- keep try to make -PRON- agree and -PRON- would not
-PRON- finally tell -PRON- -PRON- forget -PRON- checkbook
and -PRON- say to -PRON- with a look of disgust,"oh so -PRON- do_not come prepared to -PRON- visit today
-PRON- be so shocked by -PRON- comment that -PRON- just sit there speechless
bottom_line if -PRON- need affordability for thing like crown and root_canal this be a good place
luckily -PRON- have never have a root_canal but -PRON- need a crown due_to a crack tooth and -PRON- quote -PRON- a price about $_300 low than where -PRON- actually get the work do
-PRON- be tell -PRON- price be low for other thing too
however -PRON- believe -PRON- lie to uninformed patient and scam -PRON-
beware and absolutely get a second opinion
-PRON- find this_place to be ok
the big problem be there be always a little queue on weekend
also -PRON- egg be good but toronto have many_other good breakfast place than this one include chain like cora 's or eggsmart
-PRON- take -PRON- 2 dog to this clinic on a recommendation and be glad -PRON- do
the support staff be knowledgeable and caring
-PRON- be not a client yet and call about a prescription diet -PRON- be buy in the usa
-PRON- research -PRON- with the manufacturer and promptly call -PRON- back
when the girl be due for a checkup -PRON- see dr wendy
and -PRON- be wonderful
-PRON- get an_appointment quickly and be see right on time
great clinic
madison and macy thank -PRON-
excellent wing with more flavor than just mild or hot
-PRON- order garlic parm and lemon garlic both of which be delicious
the fry be also surprisingly good as fry rarely be at a pizza place
to top -PRON- off delivery be within the time quote and even a little early
driver be polite as_well
only potential issue be the 3.50 delivery charge but -PRON- be well_worth -PRON- if -PRON- do_not want to go in to pick_up -PRON- food
definitely give -PRON- a try delivery or pickup
overrate
both food and service be wanting-
there be several superior choice for italian fare or pizza in ft
mill\/tega cay
always support -PRON- local uso even if -PRON- be not active duty or retire
god bless america
visit champaign on business and stumble onto this great irish pub
first of all the decor be very traditional irish
second more_importantly be -PRON- call a snakebite a snakebite not black velvet or one of the other abomination
-PRON- eat before -PRON- find this gem so no food for -PRON-
-PRON- will eat the next_time -PRON- be in_town
juan be great too
slainte
food be good and delivery be quick
eat from here often and have never have a bad_experience
try the singapore rice noodles if -PRON- eat_here
a surprising thai place in the small town of brunswick oh
-PRON- be impressed_with the décor here and the fact_that -PRON- be family run and the cook be thai
-PRON- have all the classic dish pad_thai pad see ewe etc as_well_as dish like teriyaki chicken for the more timid
-PRON- will adjust the level of spice per -PRON- request good table service
full bar
highly_recommend if -PRON- be in the akron area
usually when -PRON- order fish and chip at a place -PRON- end_up with something that be more batter see greasy dark brown and crusty than fish and -PRON- stomach do somersault within an_hour
not so at off the hook
-PRON- be pleasantly_surprised to get a nice piece_of halibut that be light in colour not hide in a coating of greasy batter and do_not make -PRON- stomach flip afterwards
the secret must be in the coating include organic or gluten_free flour and whatev type_of oil -PRON- use to cook -PRON- fish
-PRON- just taste healthy than_most place
-PRON- be just one piece_of halibut with homemade tartar sauce but -PRON- be more_than_enough alongside a portion of yam fry with dip sauce and coleslaw all for $_13
that be a great price because most place charge_$ 15-$17 per plate for substandard fish and chip
the service be quick and friendly there be a little bar in the back with a couple of brew on_tap on this night -PRON- choose spearhead and there be limited seating
-PRON- be there on a saturday_night
all but one or two table be full and quite a_few people be come in for take away
this store have generally have good service but recently -PRON- want to purchase some window screen
-PRON- promptly receive a call from jeremy and -PRON- measure the window and give -PRON- a price
-PRON- go to pay for -PRON- and -PRON- take -PRON- over_an_hour to do so
-PRON- be tell to go to the customer_service desk and wait for a while until -PRON- ask the cashier
artie -PRON- come to the customer_service desk look -PRON- way and take off with another employee
-PRON- be bounce around from the cashier to the customer_service desk to another employee and finally to a lady_who take the time to get -PRON- take_care_of
a confusing and arduous experience
-PRON- recently take a cross country road trip and plot out a_few brewpub to visit on beermapping.com
-PRON- must_say -PRON- be extremely glad -PRON- stop here
this be what -PRON- think of when -PRON- think of a good brewpub
heck even if this_place do_not serve there own beer -PRON- would come_here often
-PRON- have a knowledgeable staff who be around quite often to get -PRON- order
-PRON- never have an empty glass which make this beer fan very happy
-PRON- do_not get to try too_much of -PRON- food but look_at other people 's order -PRON- could tell -PRON- be pretty_good bar fare with a_few twist
-PRON- have the pizza bite which -PRON- friend and -PRON- fall in love with
-PRON- be crispy flavorful and absolutely awesome
-PRON- beer be what -PRON- come for and -PRON- do_not_disappoint in the slight
the good one -PRON- try be -PRON- cask coffee stout
-PRON- be very creamy and the coffee flavor be noticeable but not overpower
-PRON- be a_bit disappointed that -PRON- do_not have a sampler for -PRON- beer but -PRON- do -PRON- duty and have a full glass of each of -PRON- own
very good stuff
-PRON- be a bottle shop as_well which mean -PRON- can buy individual bottle_of a huge_selection of beer
and as previously state the staff be very_knowledgeable
-PRON- ask about flemish sour ale and -PRON- turn_out -PRON- not only know_what -PRON- be but have two -PRON- could purchase and take home with -PRON-
excellent
the seating be pretty awesome as_well there be table all over and a great use of space
there be this odd bar like thing that run through the center of the building and in one corner -PRON- have a huge pile of board game stack
-PRON- like the way these_people think
there be nothing like kick back with some friend and a brew while play game
the feel of the place be that of a local hangout which personally -PRON- feel the most comfortable around
honestly -PRON- be a little jealous that -PRON- do_not live_in_phoenix so that -PRON- could come_here more_often
-PRON- will be make a point to stop here everytime
-PRON- drive_through though
-PRON- highly_recommend this brewpub
this_place be a joke
-PRON- make_an_appointment for -PRON- and then -PRON- have to wait 2_hour to be see
why would -PRON- make appointment if -PRON- do_not stick to -PRON-
-PRON- dislocate -PRON- knee at work and think -PRON- tear -PRON- acl in the process
the pa want to send -PRON- to therapy without get an mri to see if anything be wrong
-PRON- literally have to beg -PRON- to send -PRON- for a mri
there have to be a good way to get help for work relate injury
the customer_service and professionalism be terrible
-PRON- order item for a wedding
-PRON- give -PRON- a time and date to pick_up
nothing be ready
-PRON- do the engraving while -PRON- wait an_hour and the other item do_not come in
not even an apology
-PRON- will_never consider go there again
-PRON- get takeaway here the other night because -PRON- just move into -PRON- flat and have no cook supply
ok -PRON- do_not think -PRON- really need an_excuse to get takeaway
anyway -PRON- have not try any_other malaysian food here in edinburgh but -PRON- do enjoy a good beef rendang back when -PRON- live in nyc
-PRON- do_not really care for the rendang at nanyang though
the beef do_not seem slow cooked and tender like -PRON- be use to -PRON- find -PRON- quite chewy and tough
the sauce be not creamy and instead be mostly just chewy shredded coconut
since -PRON- have not have much malaysian food around here yet maybe this be the style -PRON- just be not what -PRON- be use to usually like -PRON- with a much creamy sauce with coconut milk and -PRON- do_not_care for -PRON-
-PRON- probably will not be back anytime_soon as -PRON- seem there be good malaysian place nearby
sure -PRON- could hate on lgo for -the difficulty of find a parking spot although people be always come and go wait 2 minute and someone will vacate a spot or there be always parking across the street -the crowd or occasional snobby worker more_often than not the people be friendly
and -PRON- do_not wait more_than 5_min to order even_though the line look daunting
-the -PRON- dish be good and -PRON- know -PRON- high price
but if -PRON- be base the review of lgo on food experience 5_star
-PRON- big complaint would be the vegetarian sandwich but -PRON- live and -PRON- learn and -PRON- do_not order -PRON- anymore
look for something veg
the sweet potatoe sushi_roll vegetarian breakfast_burrito and the mother earth pizza which can be make vegan and\/or gluten_free be all great choice
other highlight the commuter sandwich with turkey the amazing pizza and -PRON- splendid iced green_tea or anything_else from the coffee bar
but finally -PRON- dare -PRON- to taste a tammie coe pastry that do_not blow -PRON- mind
the good be the ooey gooey cupcake do_not be lead astray by how good the red_velvet look just get the ooey gooey trust me
if -PRON- be feel dangerous the old_fashioned which look_like a hostess cupcake be wonderful as be the cookie and cake
if -PRON- be not a confection kind_of person and -PRON- can resist the pastry shelf move due south within the restaurant to the gelato shop where the ice_cream be equally as delicious as the rest_of the food
